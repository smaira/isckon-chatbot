Introduction

Sri Caitanya-caritamrta is the principal work on the life and teachings of ऽप
Krsna Caitanya. $ri Caitanya is the pioneer of a great social and religious move-
ment which began in India a little less than five hundred years ago and which has
directly and indirectly influenced the subsequent course of religious and phi-
losophical thinking not only in India but in the recent West as well.

Caitanya Mahaprabhu is regarded as a figure of great historical significance.
However, our conventional method of historical analysis —that of seeing a man as
a product of his times —fails here. 5 Caitanya is a personality who transcends the
limited scope of historical settings.

At a time when, in the West, man was directing his explorative spirit toward
studying the structure of the physical universe and circumnavigating the world in
search of new oceans and continents, $ri Krsna Caitanya, in the East, was in-
augurating and masterminding a revolution directed inward, toward a scientific
understanding of the highest knowledge of man’s spiritual nature.

The chief historical sources for the life of $ri Krsna Caitanya are the kagacas (di-
aries) kept by Murari Gupta and Svaripa Damodara Gosvami. Murari Gupta, a
physician and close associate of $ri Caitanya's, recorded extensive notes on the
first twenty-four years of $ri Caitanya’s life, culminating in his initiation into the
renounced order, sannyasa. The events of the rest of Caitanya Mahaprabhu'’s for-
ty-eight years are recorded in the diary of Svarapa Damodora Gosvami, another of
Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s intimate associates.

$ri Caitanya-caritamrta is divided into three sections called 1185, which literally
means “pastimes” — Adi-lila (the early period), Madhya-lila (the middle period)
and Antya-lila (the final period). The notes of Murari Gupta form the basis of the
Adi-lila, and SvarGpa Damodara’s diary provides the details for the Madhya- and
Antya-lilas.

The first twelve of the seventeen chapters of Adi-lila constitute the preface for
the entire work. By referring to Vedic scriptural evidence, this preface establishes
$ri Caitanya as the avatara (incarnation) of Krsna (God) for the age of Kali—the
current epoch, beginning five thousand years ago and characterized by material-
ism, hypocrisy and dissension. In these descriptions, Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who
is identical with Lord Krsna, descends to liberally grant pure love of God to the
fallen souls of this degraded age by propagating sankirtana—literally,
“congregational glorification of God” —especially by organizing massive public
chanting of the maha-mantra (Great Chant for Deliverance). The esoteric purpose
of Lord Caitanya’s appearance in the world is revealed, his co-avataras and prin-
cipal devotees are described and his teachings are summarized. The remaining
portion of Adi-lila chapters thirteen through seventeen, briefly recounts his
divine birth and his life until he accepted the renounced order. This includes his
childhood miracles, schooling, marriage and early philosophical confrontations, as
well as his organization of a widespread sankirtana movement and his civil disobe-
dience against the repression of the Mohammedan government.

Sri Caitanya-caritamrta

The subject of Madhya-lila, the longest of the three divisions, is a detailed nar-
ration of Lord Caitanya's extensive and eventful travels throughout India as a
renounced mendicant, teacher, philosopher, spiritual preceptor and mystic. Dur-
ing this period of six years, $f Caitanya transmits his teachings to his principal dis-
ciples. He debates and converts many of the most renowned philosophers and
theologians of his time, including Sankarites, Buddhists and Muslims, and incor-
porates their many thousands of followers and disciples into his own burgeoning
numbers. A dramatic account of Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s miraculous activities at
the giant Jagannatha Cart Festival in Orissa is also included in this section.

Antya-lila concerns the last eighteen years of Sri Caitanya’s manifest presence,
spent in semiseclusion near the famous Jagannatha temple at Jagannatha Puri in
Orissa. During these final years, $ri Caitanya drifted deeper and deeper into
trances of spiritual ecstasy unparalleled in all of religious and literary history,
Eastern or Western. Sri Caitanya’s perpetual and ever-increasing religious
beatitude, graphically described in the eyewitness accounts of Svariipa Damodara
Gosvami, his constant companion during this period, clearly defy the investigative
and descriptive abilities of modern psychologists and phenomenologists of
religious experience.

The author of this great classic, Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami, born in the year
1507, was a disciple of Raghunatha dasa Cosvami, a confidential follower of
Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Raghunatha dasa, a renowned ascetic saint, heard and
memorized all the activities of Caitanya Mahaprabhu told to him by Svaripa
Damodara. After the passing away of $ri Caitanya and Svaripa Damodara,
Raghunatha dasa, unable to bear the pain of separation from these objects of his
complete devotion, traveled to Vrndavana, intending to commit suicide by jump-
ing from Govardhana Hill. In Vrndavana, however, he encountered Rapa Gosvami
and Sanatana Gosvami, the most confidential disciples of Caitanya Mahaprabhu.
They convinced him to give up his plan of suicide and impelled him to reveal to
them the spiritually inspiring events of Lord Caitanya’s later life. Krsnadasa Kaviraja
Cosvami was also residing in Vindavana at this time, and Raghunatha dasa
Gosvami endowed him with a full comprehension of the transcendental life of $ri
Caitanya.

By this time, several biographical works had already been written on the life of
ता Caitanya by contemporary and near-contemporary scholars and devotees.
These included Sri Caitanya-carita by Murari Gupta, Caitanya-marigala by Locana
dasa Thakura and Caitanya-bhagavata. This latter text, a work by Vrndavana dasa
Thakura, who was then considered the principal authority on Sri Caitanya’s life,
was highly revered. While composing his important work, Vrndavana dasa, fearing
that it would become too voluminous, avoided elaborately describing many of
the events of $ri Caitanya'’s life, particulary the later ones. Anxious to hear of these
later pastimes, the devotees of Vrndavana requested Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami,
whom they respected as a great saint, to compose a book to narrate these

vii

Sri Caitanya-caritamrta
episodes in detail. Upon this request, and with the permission and blessings of the
Madana-mohana Deity of Vindavana, he began compiling Sri Caitanya-caritamrta,
which, due to its biographical excellence and thorough exposition of Lord
Caitanya’s profound philosophy and teachings, is regarded as the most significant
of biographical works on $ri Caitanya.

He commenced work on the text while in his late nineties and in failing health,
as he vividly describes in the text itself: “I have now become too old and dis-
turbed in invalidity. While writing, my hands tremble. | cannot remember any-
thing, nor can | see or hear properly. Still | write, and this is a great wonder.” That
he nevertheless completed, under such debilitating conditions, the greatest liter-
ary gem of medieval India is surely one of the wonders of literary history.

This English translation and commentary is the work of His Divine Grace A. C.
Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the world’s most distinguished teacher of In-
dian religious and philosophical thought. His commentary is based upon two
Bengali commentaries, one by his teacher Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami,
the eminent Vedic scholar who predicted, “The time will come when the people
of the world will learn Bengali to read Sri Caitanya-caritamrta,” and the other by
Srila Bhaktisiddhanta’s father, Bhaktivinoda Thakura.

His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada is himself a disciplic
descendant of Sr Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and he is the first scholar to execute
systematic English translations of the major works of इ Caitanya’s followers. His
consummate Bengali and Sanskrit scholarship and intimate familiarity with the
precepts of ऽन Krsna Caitanya are a fitting combination that eminently qualifies
him to present this important classic to the English-speaking world. The ease and
clarity with which he expounds upon difficult philosophical concepts lures even a
reader totally unfamiliar with Indian religious tradition into a genuine understand-
ing and appreciation of this profound and monumental work.

The entire text, with commentary, presented in seventeen lavishly illustrated
volumes by the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, represents a contribution of major im-
portance to the intellectual, cultural and spiritual life of contemporary man.

CHAPTER 11
The Passing of Haridasa Thakura
The summary of the chapter is given by Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura in his Amrta-
pravaha-bhasya as follows. In this chapter, Brahma Haridasa Thakura gave up his
body with the consent of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and the Lord Himself per-
sonally performed the funeral ceremony and carried the body to the sea. He per-
sonally entombed the body, covered it with sand, and erected a platform on the
site. After taking bath in the sea, He personally begged prasada of Jagannatha
from shopkeepers ar distributed prasada to the assembled devotees.

SYNONYMS
eta bali’—saying this; maha-prasada—to the maha-prasada; karila vandana—he
offered respect; eka rafica—one fractional part; laAd—taking; tara karila bhak-
sana—ate it.
TRANSLATION
Saying this, he offered prayers to the maha-prasada, took a little portion,
and ate it.
PURPORT
Maha-prasada is nondifferent from Krsna. Therefore, instead of eating maha-
prasada, one should honor it. It is said here, karila vandana, “he offered prayers.”
When taking maha-prasada, one should not consider the food ordinary prepara-
tions. Prasada means favor. One should consider maha-prasada a favor of Krsna.
As stated by Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura, krsna bada dayamaya karibare jihva jaya
svaprasada-anna dila bhai. Krsna is very kind. In this material world we are all very
attached to tasting various types of food. Therefore, Krsna eats many nice
varieties of food and offers the food back to the devotees, so that not only are
one’s demands for various tastes satisfied, but by eating prasada he makes ad-
vancement in spiritual life. Therefore, we should never consider ordinary food on
an equal level with maha-prasada.

TRANSLATION
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu further inquired from Haridasa, (ग you ascer-
tain what your disease 15२८८ Haridasa Thakura replied, “My disease is that |
cannot complete my rounds.”
PURPORT
If one cannot complete the fixed number of rounds he is assigned, he should be
considered to be in a diseased condition of spiritual life. Srila Haridasa Thakura is
called namacarya. Of course, we cannot imitate Haridasa Thakura, but everyone
must chant a prescribed number of rounds. In our Krsna consciousness movement
we have fixed sixteen rounds as the minimum so that the Westerners will not feel
burdened. These sixteen rounds must be chanted, and chanted loudly, so that

প্রভু কহে, -“বৃদ্ধ হইলা “সংখ্যা” অষ্জ কর |
সিজ্ধ-দেহ তুমি, সাধনে আগ্রহ কেনে কর ? ২৪ ॥
prabhu kahe, — “vrddha ha-ila “53/77/0031 alpa kara
siddha-deha tumi, sadhane agraha kene kara?
SYNONYMS
prabhu kahe—Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu said; vrddha ha-ili—you have
become old; sankhya alpa kara—reduce your number; siddha-deha tumi—you
are already liberated; sadhane—in the regulative principles; agraha kene kara—
why are you eager.
TRANSLATION
“Now that you have become ০10, the Lord said, ‘‘you may reduce the num-
ber of rounds you chant daily. You are already liberated, and therefore you
need not follow the regulative principles very strictly.
PURPORT
Unless one has come to the platform of spontaneous love of God, he must
follow the regulative principles. Thakura Haridasa was the living example of how
to follow the regulative principles. Similarly, Raghunatha dasa Gosvami was also
such a living example. In the Sad-gosvamy-astaka it is stated: sarkhya-parvaka-
nama-gana-natibhih kalavasanikrtau. The Gosvamis, especially Raghunatha dasa
Gosvami, strictly followed all the regulative principles. The first regulative prin-
ciple is that one must chant the Hare Krsna maha-mantra loudly enough so that he
can hear himself, and one must vow to chant a fixed number of rounds. Not only
was Raghunatha dasa Gosvami chanting a fixed number of rounds, but he had
also taken a vow to bow down many times and offer obeisances to the Lord.

Text 27] The Passing of Haridasa Thakura 13
TRANSLATION
‘‘Your role in this incarnation is to deliver the people in general. You have
sufficiently preached the glories of the holy name in this world.”
PURPORT
Haridasa Thakura is known as namacarya because it is he who preached the
glories of chanting hari-nama, the holy name of God. By using the words tomara
avatara (“your incarnation”), Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu confirms that Haridasa
Thakura is the incarnation of Lord Brahma. Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura
says that advanced devotees help the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His
mission and that such devotees or personal associates incarnate by the will of the
Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord incarnates by His own will, and, by His will,
competent devotees also incarnate to help Him in His mission. Haridasa Thakura is
thus the incarnation of Lord Brahma, and other devotees are likewise incarnations
who help in the prosecution of the Lord's mission.

example, | was offered the sraddha-patra that should have been offered to

eaters.
PURPORT
Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura, in his Anubhasya, quotes from the
Visnu-smrti in reference to sraddha-patra.
brahmanapasada hy ete
kathitah pankti-dasakah
etan vivarjayed yatnat
sraddha-karmani panditah
According to this verse, if one is born in a brahmana family but does not behave
according to brahminical standards, he should not be offered the sraddha-patra,
which is prasada offered to the forefathers. Advaita Acarya offered the sraddha-
patra to Haridasa Thakura, not to a brahmana who had been born in a brahmana
family. Although Haridasa Thakura was born in the family of meateaters, because
he was an advanced devotee he was shown more respect than a first-class
brahmana.

PURPORT
At Purusottama-ksetra, or Jagannatha Puri, there is a temple of Tota-gopinatha.
If one goes from there to the sea, he can discover the tomb of Haridasa Thakura
still existing. Every year on the date of Ananta-caturdasi there is a festival to com-
memorate the passing away of Haridasa Thakura. At the same place, three Deities


--- Page 49 ---
46 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Antya-lila, Ch. 11
of Nityananda, Krsna Caitanya and Advaita Prabhu were established about one
hundred years ago. A gentleman named Bhramaravara from Kendrapada in the
province of Orissa contributed funds to establish these Deities in the temple. The
management of the temple was under the Tota-gopinatha gosvamis.

This temple was later sold to someone else, and this party is now maintaining
the seva-paja of the temple. Near this temple and the tomb of Haridasa Thakura,
Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura constructed a small house, called Bhakti-kuti. In the
Bengali year 1329, Purusottama-matha, a branch of the Gaudiya Matha, was
established there. In the Bhakti-ratnakara it is stated:

Srinivasa sighra samudrera kale gela
haridasa-thakurera samadhi dekhila
bhamite padiya kaila pranati vistara
bhagavata-gana sri-samadhi-sannidhane
Srinivase sthira kaila sasneha-vacane
punah srinivasa sri-samadhi pranamiya
ye vilapa kaila, ta sunile drave hiya
“Srinivasa Thakura quickly ran to the seashore. When he saw the tomb of
Haridasa Thakura, he immediately fell down offering prayers and almost fainted.
The devotees present there pacified him with very sweet and affectionate words,
and Srinivasa again offered his obeisances to the tomb. Hearing of the separation
that Srinivasa expressed in his lamentation at the tomb of Haridasa Thakura makes
one's heart melt.”

TRANSLATION
Haridasa Thakura was not only the topmost devotee of the Lord, but also a
great and learned scholar. It was his great fortune that he passed away before
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.
PURPORT
Haridasa Thakura is mentioned here as the most learned scholar, parama-vid-
van. Actually, the most important science to know is the science of getting out of
the clutches of material existence. Anyone who knows this science must be con-
sidered the greatest learned person. Anyone who knows the temporary situation
of this material world and is expert in achieving a permanent situation in the
spiritual world, who knows that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is beyond
the jurisdiction of our experimental knowledge, is understood to be the most
learned scholar. Haridasa Thakura knew this science perfectly. Therefore, he is de-
scribed in this connection as parama-vidvan. He personally preached the impor-
tance of chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra, which is approved by the revealed
scriptures. As stated in the Srimad-Bhagavatam (7.5.24):
iti purhsarpita visnau
bhaktis cen nava-laksana
kriyeta bhagavaty addha
tan manye ‘dhitam uttamam
There are nine different processes of devotional service to Krsna, the most impor-
tant being sravanarn kirtanam— hearing and chanting. Haridasa Thakura knew this


--- Page 52 ---
Text 107] The Passing of Haridasa Thakura 49
science very well, and he can therefore be called, technically, sarva-sastradhiti.
Anyone who has learned the essence of all the Vedic scripture is to be known as a
first-class educated person, with full knowledge of all sastra.

CHAPTER 12
The Loving Dealings
Between Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu
and Jagadananda Pandita

A summary of the Twelfth Chapter is given by Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura in his
Amrta-pravaha-bhasya as follows. This chapter discusses the transformations of
ecstatic love that $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu exhibited day and night. The devotees
from Bengal again journeyed to Jagannatha Puri to see Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.
As usual, the leader was Sivananda Sena, who traveled with his wife and children.
Because arrangements were delayed en route and Lord Nityananda did not have a
suitable place to reside, He became somewhat disturbed. Thus He became very
angry with Sivananda Sena, who was in charge of the affairs of the party, and
kicked him in loving anger. Sivananda Sena felt highly favored to have been
kicked by Nityananda Prabhu, but his nephew Srikanta Sena became upset and
therefore left their company. He met Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu at Jagannatha Puri
before the rest of the party arrived.

That year a devotee named Parame$vara dasa Modaka also went with his
family to see Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu at Jagannatha Puri. The devotees often in-
vited Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu to eat with them. When the Lord bade them all
farewell, He talked very pleasingly with them. The year before, Jagadananda Pan-
dita had been sent to Sacimata with prasada and cloth. This year he returned to
Puri with a big pot of floral-scented oil to massage the Lord's head. The Lord,
however, would not accept the oil, and because of His refusal, Jagadananda Pan-
dita broke the pot in front of Him and began to fast. The Lord tried to pacify him
and asked Jagadananda Pandita to cook for Him. Jagadananda Pandita became so
pleased when Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu accepted his cooking that he broke his
fast.

PURPORT
According to Raghunandana Bhattacarya, the spokesman for the smarta regula-
tive principles:
pratah-snane vrate sraddhe
dvadasyarn grahane tatha
madya-lepa-samarn tailam
tasmat tailam vivarjayet
“If one who has taken a vow smears oil on his body while bathing in the morning,
while observing a ritualistic ceremony like the sraddha ceremony, or on dvadasi
day, he may as well pour wine over his body. Therefore, oil should be rejected.”
This word vrata (vow) is sometimes understood to refer to the sannyasa-vrata.
Raghunandana Bhattacarya has also said in his book Tithi-tattva:
ghrtam ca sarsaparn tailari
yat tailarh puspa-vasitam
adustam pakva-tailarh ca
tailabhyange ca nityasah
This means that clarified butter (ghee), mustard oil, floral oil and boiled oil may be
used only by grhasthas, householders.

PURPORT
The word vivarta means accepting something to be the opposite of what it ap-
pears. Here, Jagadananda Pandita appeared very angry, but this anger was a
manifestation of his great love for Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Prema-vivarta is also


--- Page 121 ---
118 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Antya-lila, Ch. 12
the name of a book written by Jagadananda Pandita. Therefore the author of
Caitanya-caritamrta, Krsnadasa Kavirdja Gosvami, uses the words prema-vivarta to
refer to one who reads the book or hears about Jagadananda Pandita’s relation-
ships with ऽ Caitanya Mahaprabhu. In either case, such a person very soon
achieves love of Krsna.

Caitanya Mahaprabhu.

CHAPTER 13
Pastimes with Jagadananda Pandita
and Raghunatha Bhatta Gosvami

Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura gives the following summary of the Thirteenth Chapter
in his Amrta-pravaha-bhasya. Thinking Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu to be uncom-
fortable sleeping on bark of plantain trees, Jagadananda made a pillow and quilt
for Him. The Lord, however, did not accept them. Then Svarapa Damodara
Cosvami made another pillow and quilt from finely shredded plantain leaves, and
after strongly objecting, the Lord accepted them. With the permission of Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu, Jagadananda Pandita went to Vrndavana, where he dis-
cussed many devotional subjects with Sanatana Gosvami. There was also a dis-
cussion about Mukunda Sarasvati’s garment. When Jagadananda returned to
Jagannatha Puri, he presented Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu some gifts from Sanatana
Cosvami, and the incident of the pilu fruit took place.

Once, $1 Caitanya Mahaprabhu became ecstatic upon hearing the songs of a
deva-dasi. Unaware of who was singing, He ran toward her through thorny
bushes, but when Govinda informed the Lord that it was a woman singing, He im-
mediately stopped. By this incident, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu instructed every-
one that sannyasis and Vaisnavas should not hear women singing.

When Raghunatha Bhatta Gosvami left Varanasi on his way to Jagannatha Pur?
after completing his education, he met Ramadasa Visvasa Pandita. Visvasa Pandita
was very proud of his education, and being an impersonalist, he was not well
received by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. A partial study of the life of Raghunatha
Bhatta Gosvami comprises the end of this chapter.

“As soon as the plunderers on the road see a Bengali traveling alone, they

traverses the roads of Bihar, the plunderers on the road capture him, rob all his
belongings and kidnap him for their own service. According to one opinion, the
rogues of Bihar know very well that Bengalis are intelligent; therefore these
thieves generally force the Bengalis into service requiring intelligence and do not
allow them to leave.

TRANSLATION
“Do not mix freely with the residents of Mathura; show them respect from a
distance. Because you are on a different platform of devotional service, you
cannot adopt their behavior and practices.
PURPORT
The residents of Vrndavana and Mathura are devotees of Krsna in parental
affection, and their feelings always conflict with the opinions of smarta-
brahmanas. Devotees who worship Krsna in opulence cannot understand the
parental devotional feelings of the residents of Mathura and Vrndavana, who
follow the path of spontaneous love. Devotees on the platform of vidhi-marga
(regulative devotional principles) may misunderstand the activities of those on
the platform of raga-marga (devotional service in spontaneous love). Therefore Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu instructed Jagadananda Pandita to remain apart from the
residents of Vrndavana, who were spontaneous devotees, so as not to become
disrespectful toward them.

SYNONYMS
sighra—as soon as possible; asiha—return; tahan—there; na rahiha—do not
remain; cira-kala—for a long time; govardhane —on Govardhana Hill; na cadiha—
do not climb; dekhite gopala—to see the Gopala Deity.
TRANSLATION
‘*You should remain in Vrndavana for only a short time and then return here
as soon as possible. Also, do not climb Govardhana Hill to see the Gopala
Deity.
PURPORT
In his Amrta-pravaha-bhasya, Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura advises that one avoid
remaining in Vrndavana for a very long time. As the saying goes, “Familiarity
breeds contempt.” If one stays in Vindavana for many days, he may fail to main-
tain proper respect for its inhabitants. Therefore those who have not attained the
stage of spontaneous love for Krsna should not live in Vindavana very long. It is
better for them to make short visits. One should also avoid climbing Govardhana
Hill to see the Gopala Deity. Since Govardhana Hill itself is identical with Gopala,
one should not step on the hill or touch it with his feet. One may see Gopala
when He goes elsewhere.

TRANSLATION

‘This saffron cloth is unfit for a Vaisnava to wear; therefore | have no use for

it. | shall give it to a stranger.”
PURPORT

Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura comments on this incident as follows:
Vaisnavas are all liberated persons, unattached to anything material. Therefore a
Vaisnava need not accept the dress of a sannyasi to prove his exalted position. Sr
Caitanya Mahaprabhu accepted the renounced order from a sannyasi of the
Mayavada school. Present-day Vaisnava sannyasis, however, never think that by
accepting the dress of the sannyasa order they have become equal to Caitanya
Mahaprabhu. In fact, a Vaisnava accepts the sannydsa order to remain an eternal
servant of his spiritual master. He accepts the sannyasa order knowing that he is
unequal to his spiritual master, who is a paramaharisa, and he thinks that he is un-
fit to dress like a paramaharisa. Therefore a Vaisnava accepts sannyasa out of
humility, not out of pride.

Sanatana Gosvami had adopted the dress of a paramaharsa; therefore it was
inappropriate for him to wear the saffron cloth on his head. However, a Vaisnava


--- Page 150 ---
Text 63] Pastimes with Jagadananda and Raghunatha Bhatta 147
sannyasi does not think himself fit to imitate the dress of a paramaharnsa
Vaisnava. According to the principles set down by जा Caitanya Mahaprabhu
(00030 api sunicena), one should always think himself in the lowest stage, not on
the level of a paramahamsa Vaisnava. Thus a Vaisnava will sometimes accept the
sannyasa order just to keep himself below the level of a paramaharisa Vaisnava.
This is the instruction of Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura.

asta-masa—for eight months; rahi’—staying; prabhu—Sri  Caitanya
Mahaprabhu; bhatte—to Raghunatha Bhatta; vidaya dila—bid farewell; vivaha na
kariha—do not marry; bali’—saying; nisedha karila—he forbade.
TRANSLATION
After eight months, when Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu bade farewell to
Raghunatha Bhatta, the Lord flatly forbade him to marry. ‘Do not marry,’ the
Lord said.
PURPORT
Raghunatha Bhattacarya had become a greatly advanced devotee while still un-
married. $i Caitanya Mahaprabhu could see this, and therefore He advised him
not to begin the process of material sense gratification. Marriage is a concession
for people who are unable to control their senses. Raghunatha, however, being an
advanced devotee of Krsna, naturally had no desire for sense gratification.
Therefore Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu advised him not to enter the bondage of mar-
riage. Generally a person cannot make much advancement in spiritual conscious-
ness if he is married. He becomes attached to his family and is prone to sense
gratification. Thus his spiritual advancement is very slow or almost nil.

170 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Antya-lila, Ch. 13
TRANSLATION
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu said to Raghunatha Bhatta, “When you return
home, serve your aged father and mother, who are devotees, and try to study
Srimad-Bhagavatam from a pure Vaisnava who has realized God.”
PURPORT
One should note how ऽ Caitanya Mahaprabhu, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, advised Raghunatha Bhattacarya to learn Srimad-Bhagavatam. He ad-
vised him to understand Srimad-Bhagavatam not from professional men but from
areal bhagavata, devotee. He also advised Raghunatha Bhatta to serve his mother
and father because they were both His devotees. Anyone who wishes to advance
in Krsna consciousness must try to serve the devotees of Krsna. As Narottama
dasa Thakura says, chadiya vaisnava-seva nistara payeche keba: “Without serving
a self-realized Vaisnava, no one has ever been released from the materialistic way
of life.” Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu would have never advised Raghunatha Bhatta to
serve ordinary parents, but since his parents were Vaisnavas, the Lord advised him
to serve them.
One might ask “Why shouldn't ordinary parents be served?” As stated in
Srimad-Bhagavatam (5.5.18):
gurur na sa syat svajano na sa syat
pita na sa syaj janani na sa syat
daivari na tat syat na patis ca sa syan
na mocayed yah samupeta-mrtyum
“One who cannot deliver his dependent from the path of birth and death should
never become a spiritual master, a relative, a father or mother, or a worshipable
demigod, nor should such a person become a husband.” Everyone naturally gets a
father and mother at the time of birth, but the real father and mother are they
who can release their offspring from the clutches of imminent death. This is pos-
sible only for parents advanced in Krsna consciousness. Therefore any parents
who cannot enlighten their offspring in Krsna consciousness cannot be accepted
as a real father and mother. The following verse from the Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu
(1.2.200) confirms the uselessness of serving ordinary parents:
laukiki vaidiki vapi
ya kriya kriyate mune
hari-sevanukalaiva
sa karya bhaktim icchata


--- Page 174 ---
Text 114] Pastimes with Jagadananda and Raghunatha Bhatta 171
“One should perform only those activities —either worldly or prescribed by Vedic
rules and regulations —which are favorable for the cultivation of Krsna conscious-
ness.”

Concerning the study of Srimad-Bhagavatam, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu clearly
advises that one avoid hearing from a non-Vaisnava professional reciter. In this
connection Sanatana Gosvami quotes a verse from the Padma Purana:

avaisnava-mukhodgirpari
(20 {217 hari-kathamrtam
Sravanari naiva kartavyarn
sarpocchistarin yatha payah
“No one should hear or take lessons from a person who is not a Vaisnava. Even if
he speaks about Krsna, such a lesson should not be accepted, for it is like milk
touched by the lips of a serpent.” Nowadays it is fashionable to observe
Bhagavata-saptaha and hear Srimad-Bhagavatam from persons who are anything
but advanced devotees or self-realized souls. There are even many Mayavadis
who read Srimad-Bhagavatam to throngs of people. Many Mayavadis have
recently begun reciting Srimad-Bhagavatam in Vindavana, and because they can
present the Bhagavatam with word jugglery, twisting the meaning by grammatical
tricks, materialistic persons who go to Vrndavana as a matter of spiritual fashion
like to hear them. All this is clearly forbidden by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. We
should note carefully that since these Mayavadis cannot personally know the
meaning of Srimad-Bhagavatam, they can never deliver others by reciting it. On
the other hand, an advanced devotee of the Lord is free from material bondage.
He personifies the Srimad-Bhagavatam in life and action. Therefore we advise that
anyone who wants to learn the Srimad-Bhagavatam must approach such a
realized soul.

TRANSLATION
He would not listen to blasphemy of a Vaisnava, nor would he listen to talk
of a Vaisnava’s misbehavior. He knew only that everyone was engaged in
Krsna’s service; he did not understand anything else.
PURPORT
Raghunatha Bhatta never did anything harmful to a Vaisnava. In other words,
he was never inattentive in the service of the Lord, nor did he ever violate the
rules and regulations of a pure Vaisnava. It is the duty of a Vaisnava acarya to pre-
vent his disciples and followers from violating the principles of Vaisnava behavior.
He should always advise them to strictly follow the regulative principles, which
will protect them from falling down. Although a Vaisnava preacher may some-
times criticize others, Raghunatha Bhatta avoided this. Even if another Vaisnava
was actually at fault, Raghunatha Bhatta would not criticize him; he saw only that
everyone was engaged in Krsna's service. That is the position of a maha-
bhagavata. Actually, even if one is serving maya, in a higher sense he is also a ser-
vant of Krsna. Because maya is the servant of Krsna, anyone serving maya serves
Krsna indirectly. Therefore it is said:
keha mane, keha na mane, saba tanra dasa
ye na mane, tara haya sei pape nasa
“Some accept Him, whereas others do not, yet everyone is His servant. One who
does not accept Him, however, will be ruined by his sinful activities.”

CHAPTER 14
Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s
Feelings of Separation from Krsna
Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura gives the following summary of the Fourteenth
Chapter of Antya-lila. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s feelings of separation from Krsna
resulted in highly elevated transcendental madness. When He was standing near
the Garuda-stambha and praying to Lord Jagannatha, a woman from Orissa put
her foot on the Lord's shoulder in her great eagerness to see Lord Jagannatha.
Govinda chastised her for this, but Caitanya Mahaprabhu praised her eagerness.
When Caitanya Mahaprabhu went to the temple of Lord Jagannatha, He was ab-
sorbed in ecstatic love and saw only Krsna. As soon as He perceived this woman,
however, His external consciousness immediately returned, and He saw Jagan-
natha, Baladeva and Subhadra. Caitanya Mahaprabhu also saw Krsna in a dream,
and He was overwhelmed with ecstatic love. When He could no longer see Krsna,
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu compared Himself to a yogi and described how that
yogi was seeing Vrndavana. Sometimes all the transcendental ecstatic symptoms
were manifest in Him. One night, Govinda and Svarapa Damodara noticed that al-
though the three doors to the Lord's room were closed and locked, the Lord was
not present inside. Seeing this, Svarapa Damodara and the other devotees went
outside and saw the Lord lying unconscious by the gate known as Sirhha-dvara.
His body had become unusually long, and the joints of His bones were loose. The
devotees gradually brought Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu back to His senses by
chanting the Hare Krsna mantra, and then they took Him back to His residence.
Once Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu mistook Cataka-parvata for Govardhana-parvata.
As He ran toward it, He became stunned, and then the eight ecstatic transforma-
tions appeared in His body due to great love for Krsna. At that time all the devo-
tees chanted the Hare Krsna mantra to pacify Him.

Text 8] The Lord's Feelings of Separation 189
PURPORT
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s transcendental feelings of separation from Krsna and
His consequent madness are not at all understandable by a person on the material
platform. Nonetheless, a so-called party of devotees named nadiya-nagari has
sprung up and introduced the worship of Visnupriya. This certainly indicates their
ignorance concerning $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s pastimes. In the opinion of
Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura, such worship is a product of the imagination.
Many other methods of worshiping Caitanya Mahaprabhu have also been in-
troduced, but they have all been rejected by stalwart devotees like Bhaktivinoda
Thakura. The groups practicing such unauthorized worship have been listed by
Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura:
aula, baula, kartabhaja, neda, daravesa, sani
sahajiya, sakhibheki, smarta, jata-gosani
ativadi, cadadhari, gauranga-nagari
Svartpa Damodara Gosvami and Raghunatha dasa Cosvami witnessed Caitanya
Mahaprabhu’s activities firsthand, and they recorded them in two notebooks.
Therefore, without reference to these notebooks, one cannot understand the ac-
tivities of Sn Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Anyone inventing some new method for
worshiping Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is certainly unable to understand the Lord's
pastimes, for he is bereft of the real process of approaching the Lord.

PURPORT
Besides Svartpa Damodara and Raghunatha dasa Gosvami, there were many
others who also recorded Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s activities. Srila Bhakti-
siddhanta Sarasvati Thakura believes that the people of the world would benefit
greatly if such notes were available. It is a most unfortunate situation for human
society that none of these notebooks are still extant.

For future reference, we should remember that Svaripa Damodara Gosvami
recorded the pastimes briefly, whereas Raghunatha dasa Gosvami recorded them
elaborately. These two great personalities simply recorded the facts; they did not
create any descriptive literary embellishments.

Text 15] The Lord’s Feelings of Separation 193
such a conception; apanake —upon Himself; haya—becomes; radha-jAana—con-
sideration as Srimati Radharani.
TRANSLATION
Srimati Radharani’s emotions after seeing Uddhava exactly correspond to
those of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. He always conceived of Himself in Her
position and sometimes thought that He was Srimati Radharani Herself.
PURPORT
Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura explains that the purport of the word
abhimana, or “self-conception,” is that Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu thought Himself
to be in the position of Srimati Radharant and was always ready to render service
in that way. Although Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is Krsna Himself, He assumed the
complexion and emotions of Srimati Radharant and remained in that status. He
never assumed the complexion or status of Lord Krsna. Of course, Krsna wanted
to experience the role of Srimati Radharani; that is the original cause of His assum-
ing the body of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Therefore pure Vaisnavas never disturb
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s conception of being Srimati Radharant.
„ Unfortunately, at the present time a group of so-called devotees maintain that
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is the enjoyer and that they are enjoyers as well. They
have actually deviated from devotional service to the Lord. Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu manifested Himself to show that cultivation of love for Krsna in
separation is the easiest way of success for all living entities. Despite this fact,
there are some theosophists who declare that because Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu
is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, such cultivation is easy for Him but dif-
ficult for the living entity and that one can therefore approach Krsna in any way
he likes. To nullify this idea, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu demonstrated practically
how one can achieve love of Krsna by adopting Srimati Radharani’'s mood in
separation from Krsna.

the crowd, climbed the column of Garuda, placing her foot on Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu’s shoulder.

dekhiya govinda aste-vyaste strike varjila
tare namaite prabhu govinde nisedhila
SYNONYMS
dekhiya—seeing; govinda—the personal servant of $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu;
aste-vyaste—with great haste; strike —the woman; varjila—got down; tare—her;
namaite—to get down; prabhu —Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu; govinde —Govinda;
nisedhila —forbade.
TRANSLATION
When he saw this, Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s personal secretary, Govinda,
hastily got her down from her position. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, however,
chastised him for this.
PURPORT
Because Garuda is the carrier of Lord Visnu, he is the supreme Vaisnava.
Therefore to touch his body with one’s feet or to climb the column of Garuda is
certainly a vaisnava-aparadha, an offense to a Vaisnava. The woman was also
offensive to Krsna by putting her foot on the shoulder of 51 Caitanya
Mahaprabhu. Seeing all these offenses, Govinda very hastily made her get down.

PURPORT
The woman was so eager to see Lord Jagannatha that she forgot she was
offending the feet of a Vaisnava by climbing the column of Garuda. She also
neglected to consider that by putting her foot on the shoulder of Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu, she offended the Supreme Personality of Godhead. These are both
grievous offenses that displease the Supreme Lord and Vaisnavas. She was so
eager to see Lord Jagannatha, however, that she committed all these offenses
obliviously. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu praised her eagerness; He regretted that
Lord Jagannatha had not bestowed such great eagerness upon Him.

TRANSLATION

Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu said, “1 found Krsna, the Lord of Vrndavana, but 1

have lost Him again. Who has taken My Krsna? Where have | come?”
PURPORT

These are the feelings of Srimati Radharant. First Lord Caitanya felt that He had
been taken to Vrndavana, where He saw Krsna’s rasa dance with the gopis. Then
He was brought to Kuruksetra to see Lord Jagannatha, His sister (Subhadra) and
Lord Balarama. ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu lost Vrndavana and Krsna, the master of
Vrndavana. At this time, Caitanya Mahaprabhu experienced divyonmada, tran-
scendental madness in separation from Krsna. At Kuruksetra, Krsna displays His
opulence, whereas in Vrndavana He is in His original position. Krsna never goes
even a step away from Vrndavana; therefore Kuruksetra is less important for the
gopis than Vrndavana.

Although devotees who worship Krsna in opulence (His Vaikuntha aspect) may
prefer to see Lord Krsna at Kuruksetra along with Subhadra and Balarama, the
gopis want to see Krsna in Vrndavana, performing the rasa dance with Srimati
Radharani. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu showed by practical example how one can
cultivate the mood of Radharani and the other gopis in separation from Krsna.
Devotees absorbed in this mood do not like to see Krsna anywhere else but


--- Page 207 ---
Text 39] The Lord's Feelings of Separation 205
Vindavana. Therefore Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu lamented, “I found Krsna in
Vrndavana, and now | have again lost Him and come to Kuruksetra.” Unless one is
a very highly advanced devotee, he cannot understand these intricate feelings.
The author of Sri Caitanya-caritamrta, however, has tried to explain this divyon-
mada as far as possible, and it is our duty simply to appreciate it as far as possible.
Therefore the author has made the following request in verse 11:
tate visvasa kari’ Suna bhavera varnana
ha-ibe bhavera jAana, paiba prema-dhana
“My dear readers, simply try to hear this description with faith and love. That will
help you to understand transcendental ecstasy, and at last you will achieve love
of Godhead very easily.”

When Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu dreamed of the rasa dance, He was fully ab-
sorbed in transcendental bliss, but when His dream broke, He thought He had
lost a precious jewel.

Text 51] The Lord's Feelings of Separation 213
TRANSLATION
‘There is a solitary garden where Krsna enjoys His pastimes, and in one cor-
ner of a pavilion in that garden, the yogi of My mind, along with his disciples,
practices mystic yoga. Wanting to see Krsna directly, this yogi remains awake
throughout the night, meditating on Krsna who is the Supersoul, uncontami-
nated by the three modes of nature.

“When My mind lost the association of Krsna and could no longer see Him,
he became depressed and took up mystic yoga. In the void of separation from
Krsna, he experienced ten transcendental transformations. Agitated by these
transformations, My mind fled, leaving My body, his place of residence,
empty. Thus | am completely in trance.”
PURPORT
In this verse, the outward activities of the kdpalika mendicants have been de-
scribed, but not their actual life. The kapalika mendicants are tantric materialists
who carry skulls in their hands. They are not Vaisnavas and have nothing to do
with spiritual life. Therefore they are untouchable. Only an outward comparison

214 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Antya-lila, Ch. 14
has been made between the mind and their activities, but their behavior should
never be imitated.

Text 53] The Lord's Feelings of Separation 215
PURPORT
This verse is part of a description of $rimati Radharan''s different traits from Uj-
jvala-nilamani by Srila Rapa Gosvami. In this book, he elaborately explains the ten
symptoms as follows.
Cinta. As stated in the Hamsadata:
yada yato gopi-hrdaya-madano nanda-sadanan
mukundo gandinyas tanayam anurundhan madhu-purim
tadamanksic cinta-sariti ghana-ghdarnaparicayair
agadhayarm vadhamaya-payasi radha virahini
“At the request of Akrara, Krsna and Balarama left the house of Nanda Maharaja
for Mathura. At that time, Srimati Radharani’s mind was disrupted, and She be-
came almost mad because of extreme separation from Krsna. She experienced
great mental pain and agitation, which caused Her to drown in mental speculation
in the river of anxiety. She thought, ‘Now | am going to die, and when । die, Krsna
will surely come back to see Me again. But when He hears of My death from the
people of Vindavana, He will certainly be very unhappy. Therefore | shall not
die.’ ” This is the explanation of the word cinta.
Jagara. As stated in the Padyavali:
yah pasyanti priyam svapne
dhanyastah sakhi yositah
asmakam tu gate krsne
gata nidrapi vairipi’
Thinking Herself very unfortunate, Srimati Radharani addressed Her very dear
friend Visakha, “My dear friend, if | could see Krsna in My dreams, | would cer-
tainly be glorified for My great fortune. But what can | do? Sleep also plays
mischievously with Me. Indeed, it has become My enemy. Therefore | have not
slept since the departure of Krsna.”
Udvega. This word is also explained in the Hamsadlta as follows:
mano me ha kastam jvalati kim aham hanta karavai
na param navaram sumukhi kalayam yasya jaladheh
iyam vande mardhna sapadi tam upayam kathaya me
paramrsye yasmad dhrti-kanikayapi ksani-kaya
Srimati Radharani addressed Lalita, “My dear beautiful-faced Lalita, | cannot ex-
press how My heart is burning. It is a great, unfathomable ocean of anxiety. Still, |
wish to offer My obeisances at your lotus feet. What shall | do? Please consider


--- Page 218 ---
216 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Antya-lila, Ch. 14
My condition and advise Me how | can become peaceful. That is My desire.”
Tanava is described as follows:
udancad-vaktrambhoruha-vikrtir antah-kulasita
sadaharabhava-glapita-kucakoka yadu-pate
visusyanti radha tava viraha-tapad anudinam
nidaghe kuly eva krasima-paripakam prathayati
When Uddhava returned to Mathura after visiting Vrndavana, Lord Krsna inquired
from him about Radharani and Visakha. Uddhava replied as follows: “Consider the
condition of the gopis! Srimati Radharani especially is in a very painful condition
because of separation from You. She has grown skinny, and Her bodily luster is
almost gone. Her heart is immersed in pain, and because She has given up eating,
Her breast has become black, as if diseased. Because of separation from You, all
the gopis, especially Radharani, appear like dried-up water holes under the
scorching heat of the sun.”
Malina-arigata is described as follows:
hima-visara-visirnambhoja-tulyanana-srih
khara-marud-aparajyad-bandhu-jivopamausthi
agha-hara sarad-arkottapitendivaraksi
tava viraha-vipatti-mlapitasid visakha
Uddhava said to Krsna, “O most auspicious Krsna, please hear me. The tribulation
caused by Your absence has made Visakha languid. Her lips tremble like trees in a
strong wind. Her beautiful face is like a lotus flower that has withered under the
snow, and Her eyes are like lotus petals scorched by the heat of the autumn sun.”
Pralapa is explained in Lalita-madhava as follows:
kva nanda-kula-candramah kva sikhi-candra-kalarnkrtih
kva manda-murali-ravah kva nu surendra-nila-dyutih
kva rasa-rasa-tandavi kva sakhi jiva-raksausadhir
nidhir mama suhrttamah kva tava hanta ha dhig-vidhih
This is Srimati Radharani’s lamentation for Her beloved Krsna, who was away from
home. A woman whose husband has left home and gone to a foreign land is
called prosita-bhartrka. Lamenting for Krsna in the same way as such a woman
laments for her husband, Srimati Radharani said, “My dear friend, where is the
glory of the family of Maharaja Nanda, who wears a half-moon ornament on His
head? Where is Krsna, whose hue is like that of the indranila jewel and who plays
so nicely on His flute? Where is your friend, the best of all men, so expert in danc-
ing in the circle of the rasa dance? Where is He who is the real medicine to save


--- Page 219 ---
Text 53] The Lord’s Feelings of Separation 217
Me from dying of heart disease? | must condemn Providence, for he has caused
Me so many tribulations by separating Me from Krsna.”
Vyadhi is also described in Lalita-madhava:
uttapi puta-pakato 421 garala-gramad api ksobhano
dambholer api duhsahah katur alam hrn-magna-salyad api
tivrah praudha-visacikani-cayato ‘py uccair mamayam bali
marmany adya bhinatti gokula-pater vislesa-janma jvarah
Being greatly afflicted by the pain of separation from Krsna, Srimati Radharan said,
“My dear Lalita, kindly hear Me. | cannot bear suffering the fever of separation
from Krsna, nor can | explain it to you. It is something like gold melting in an
earthen box. This fever produces more distress than poison, and it is more piercing
than a thunderbolt. | suffer exactly like someone almost dead from cholera. To be
giving Me so much pain, this fever must be very strong indeed.”
Unmada is explained as follows:
bhramati bhavana-garbhe nirnimittari hasanti
prathayati tava vartarh cetanacetanesu
luthati ca bhuvi radha kampitangi murare
visama-viraha-khedodgari-vibhrante-citta
Uddhava said to Krsna, “My dear Krsna, all the gopis are so afflicted by Your ab-
sence that they have become almost mad. O Murari, at home Srimati Radharani
laughs unnecessarily and, like a madwoman, inquires about You from every entity
without distinction, even from the stones. She rolls on the ground, unable to bear
the agony of Your absence.”
Moha is explained as follows:
nirundhe dainyabdhim harati guru-cinta paribhavarn
vilumpaty unmadari sthagayati balad baspa-laharim
idanir kamsare kuvalaya-drsah kevalam idam
vidhatte sacivyar tava viraha-marccha-sahacari
Lalita wrote Krsna the following letter on Srimati Radharani’s behalf: “My dear
Krsna, separation from You has greatly agitated Srimati Radharani’s mind, and She
has fallen unconscious on the ground. O enemy of Karhsa, You have now become
a first-class politician, and therefore You can supposedly give relief to everyone.
Therefore please consider the plight of Srimati Radharani, or very soon You will
hear of Her death. Maybe at that time You will lament, although now You are
jubilant.”


--- Page 220 ---
218 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Antya-lila, Ch. 14
Mrtyu is explained in the Harnsaduta:
aye rasa-krida-rasika mama sakhyar nava-nava
pura baddha yena pranaya-lahari hanta gahana
sa cen muktapeksas tvam asi dhig imam talasakalar
yad etasya nasa-nihitam idam adyapi calati
In the following letter, Lalita chastised Krsna for staying in Mathura: “Simply by
dancing in the circle of the rasa dance, You attracted Srimati Radharani's love.
Why are You now so indifferent to my dear friend Radharani? She is lying nearly
unconscious, thinking of Your pastimes. 1 shall determine whether She is alive by
putting a cotton swab under Her nostrils, and if She is still living, | shall chastise
Her.”

Text 75] The Lord’s Feelings of Separation 227
TRANSLATION
“Sometimes Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu would go to the house of Kasi Misra.
There He would be greatly aggrieved, feeling separation from Krsna. The
joints of His transcendental body would slacken, and His arms and legs would
become elongated. Rolling on the ground, the Lord would cry out in distress
in a faltering voice and weep very sorrowfully. The appearance of Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu, awakening in my heart, maddens me.”

CHAPTER 15
The Transcendental Madness
of Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu
The following is a summary of the Fifteenth Chapter of Antya-lila. After seeing the
upala-bhoga ceremony of Lord Jagannatha, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu once more
began to feel ecstatic emotions. When He saw the garden on the beach by the
sea, He again thought that He was in Vrndavana, and when He began to think of
Krsna engaging in His different pastimes, transcendental emotions excited Him
again. On the night of the rasa dance, the gopis, bereaved by Krsna's absence,
searched for Krsna from one forest to another. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu adopted
the same transcendental thoughts as the gopis and was filled with ecstatic emo-
tion. Svarapa Damodara Gosvami recited a verse from Gita-govinda just suitable
to the Lord's emotions. Caitanya Mahaprabhu then exhibited the ecstatic
transformations known as bhavodaya, bhava-sandhi, bhava-sabalya and so on.
The Lord experienced all eight kinds of ecstatic transformations, and He relished
them very much.

Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu said: ‘ ‘Though the hearts of the gopis are like
high-standing hills, they are inundated by the waves of the nectarean ocean of
Krsna’'s beauty. His sweet voice enters their ears and gives them transcenden-
tal bliss. The touch of His body is cooler than millions and millions of moons
together, and the nectar of His bodily fragrance overfloods the entire world. O
My dear friend, that Krsna, who is the son of Nanda Maharaja and whose lips
are exactly like nectar, is attracting My five senses by force.’

TRANSLATION
१८50 Caitanya Mahaprabhu is the topmost of all devotees. Sometimes, while
walking on the beach, He would see a beautiful garden nearby and mistake it
for the forest of Vrndavana. Thus He would be completely overwhelmed by
ecstatic love of Krsna and begin to dance and chant the holy name. His tongue
worked incessantly as He chanted, ‘Krsna! Krsna!’ Will He again become vis-
ible before the path of My eyes?’’
PURPORT
This quotation is from the first Caitanyastaka, verse 6, in Srila Rapa Gosvami’s
Stava-mala.

The Author

His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada appeared in this world
in 1896 in Calcutta, India. He first met his spiritual master, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta
Sarasvati Gosvami, in Calcutta in 1922. Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati, a prominent
devotional scholar and the founder of sixty-four Gaudiya Mathas (Vedic In-
stitutes), liked this educated young man and convinced him to dedicate his life to
teaching Vedic knowledge. Srila Prabhupada became his student, and eleven
years later (1933) at Allahabad he became his formally initiated disciple.

At their first meeting, in 1922, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura requested
Srila Prabhupada to broadcast Vedic knowledge through the English language. In
the years that followed, Srila Prabhupada wrote a commentary on the Bhagavad-
gita, assisted the Gaudiya Matha in its work and, in 1944, without assistance,
started an English fortnightly magazine, edited it, typed the manuscripts and
checked the galley proofs. He even distributed the individual copies freely and
struggled to maintain the publication. Once begun, the magazine never stopped;
it is now being continued by his disciples in the West.

Recognizing Srila Prabhupada’s philosophical learning and devotion, the
Gaudiya Vaisnava Society honored him in 1947 with the title “Bhaktivedanta.” In
1950, at the age of fifty-four, Srila Prabhupada retired from married life, and four
years later he adopted the vanaprastha (retired) order to devote more time to his
studies and writing. Srila Prabhupada traveled to the holy city of Vindavana,
where he lived in very humble circumstances in the historic medieval temple of
Radha-Damodara. There he engaged for several years in deep study and writing.
He accepted the renounced order of life (sannyasa) in 1959. At Radha-Damodara,
Srila Prabhupada began work on his life's masterpiece: a multivolume translation
and commentary on the eighteen thousand verse Srimad-Bhagavatam
(Bhagavata Purana). He also wrote Easy Journey to Other Planets.

After publishing three volumes of Bhagavatam, Srila Prabhupada came to the
United States, in 1965, to fulfill the mission of his spiritual master. Since that time,
His Divine Grace has written over forty volumes of authoritative translations,
commentaries and summary studies of the philosophical and religious classics of
India.

In 1965, when he first arrived by freighter in New York City, Srila Prabhupada
was practically penniless. It was after almost a year of great difficulty that he
established the International Society for Krishna Consciousness in July of 1966.
Under his careful guidance, the Society has grown within a decade to a world-
wide confederation of almost one hundred asramas, schools, temples, institutes
and farm communities.

In 1968, Srila Prabhupada created New Vrndavana, an experimental Vedic com-
munity in the hills of West Virginia. Inspired by the success of New Vrndavana,
now a thriving farm community of more than one thousand acres, his students
have since founded several similar communities in the United States and abroad.

In 1972, His Divine Grace introduced the Vedic system of primary and second-
ary education in the West by founding the Gurukula school in Dallas, Texas. The
school began with 3 children in 1972, and by the beginning of 1975 the enroll-
ment had grown to 150.

Srila Prabhupada has also inspired the construction of a large international
center at $ridhama Mayapur in West Bengal, India, which is also the site for a
planned Institute of Vedic Studies. A similar project is the magnificent Krsna-
Balarama Temple and International Guest House in Vindavana, India. These are
centers where Westerners can live to gain firsthand experience of Vedic culture.

Srila Prabhupada’s most significant contribution, however, is his books. Highly
respected by the academic community for their authoritativeness, depth and
clarity, they are used as standard textbooks in numerous college courses. His
writings have been translated into eleven languages. The Bhaktivedanta Book
Trust, established in 1972 exclusively to publish the works of His Divine Grace,
has thus become the world’s largest publisher of books in the field of Indian
religion and philosophy. Its latest project is the publishing of Srila Prabhupada’s
most recent work: a seventeen-volume translation and commentary —completed
by Srila Prabhupada in only eighteen months —on the Bengali religious classic Sri
Caitanya-caritamrta.

In the past ten years, in spite of his advanced age, 51713 Prabhupada has circled
the globe twelve times on lecture tours that have taken him to six continents. In
spite of such a vigorous schedule, Srila Prabhupada continues to write prolifically.
His writings constitute a veritable library of Vedic philosophy, religion, literature
and culture.

(continued from front flap)

Madhya-lila (the middle period), the
longest of the three, is a detailed narration of
Sri Caitanya’s extensive and eventful travels
throughout India as a renounced mendicant,
teacher, philosopher, spiritual preceptor and
mystic. Finally, Antya-/ila (the final period)
concerns the last eighteen years of Caitanya
Mahaprabhu’s manifest presence, spent in
semiseclusion in Jagannatha Puri, Orissa.
During these final years, Sri Caitanya drifted
deeper and deeper into trances of spiritual
ecstasy unparalleled in all of religious and
literary history, Eastern or Western.

Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami, the author of
Sri Caitanya-caritamrta, was a great saint and
a confidential disciple and student of
Raghunatha dasa Gosvami, the renowned
ascetic saint who was one of the most inti-
mate disciples of Sri Caitanya. He com-
menced work on the text while in his late
nineties and in failing health, as he vividly
describes in the text itself: “I have now be-
come too old and disturbed in invalidity.
While writing, my hands tremble. | cannot
remember anything, nor can | see or hear
properly. Still 1 write, and this is a great
wonder.” That he nevertheless completed,
under such debilitating conditions, the
greatest literary gem of medieval India is
surely one of the wonders of literary history.

The English translation and commentary is
the work of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhakti-
vedanta Swami Prabhupada, the world’s
most distinguished scholar and teacher of
Indian religious and philosophical thought.
He himself is a disciplic descendant of Sri
Caitanya, and his intimate familiarity with
the precepts of Caitanya Mahaprabhu emi-
nently qualifies him to present this impor-
tant classic to the English-speaking world.
The ease and clarity with which he ex-
pounds upon Sri Caitanya’s precepts lures
even a reader totally unfamiliar with Indian
religious tradition into a genuine under-
standing and appreciation of this profound
and monumental work.

The entire text, with commentary, pre-
sented in seventeen lavishly illustrated
volumes by the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust,
represents a contribution of major impor-
tance to the intellectual, cultural and
spiritual life of contemporary man.
