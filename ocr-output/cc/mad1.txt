Introduction

“HARE KRSNA” has become a household phrase in cities, towns and
villages throughout the world, fulfilling a prophecy made almost five hundred
years ago by Lord ঠা Caitanya Mahaprabhu. From Los Angeles to London,
from Bombay to Buenos Aires, from Pittsburgh and Melbourne to Paris and
even Moscow, people of all ages, colors, creeds and faiths are feeling the bliss
of the dynamic yoga system called “Krsna consciousness.”

This Krsna consciousness movement began in full force some five hundred
years ago, when Lord $f Caitanya Mahaprabhu, an incarnation of Krsna
(God), flooded the subcontinent of India with the chanting of the mantra
Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama
Rama, Hare Hare. To reveal the secret of what real love is, Krsna came to earth
five hundred years ago in the guise of His own devotee—as Lord Caitanya
Mahaprabhu. With His chief associates— Nityananda, Advaita, Gadadhara
and $rivasa—He taught how to develop love of Godhead simply by chanting
Hare Krsna and dancing in ecstasy.

Sri Caitanya-caritamrta, which was written by the great saint Krsnadasa
Kaviradja Gosvami shortly after Lord Caitanya’s disappearance, vividly de-
scribes Lord Caitanya’s blissful pastimes and probes deeply into His profound
spiritual philosophy.

The translations and purports, the explanations of the verses, are the work
of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the author of
Bhagavad-gita As It is; The Nectar of Devotion; Krsna, the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead (first published in 1970 with the kind help of Mr. George
Harrison); and numerous other books about yoga and self-realization.

Although this is the fourth volume of ई Caitanya-caritamrta, one need not
have read the previous volumes to understand and appreciate this book. $rila
Prabhupada remarks that such a spiritual work is like sugar, for wherever you
begin tasting it you will surely enjoy its sweetness.

CHAPTER 1
The Later Pastimes
of Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu
In this chapter there is a summary description of all the pastimes performed
by গা Caitanya Mahaprabhu during the middle period of His activities as well
as the six years at the end of His activities. All of these are described in brief.
There is also a description of ऽन Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s ecstasy that occurred
when He recited the verse beginning yah kaumara-harah, and there is also an
explanation of that ecstasy given in the verse priyah so ‘yar krspah by Srila
Ripa Gosvami. Because he wrote that verse, Srila Ripa Gosvami was
specifically blessed by the Lord. There is also a description of the many books
written by Srila Rapa Gosvami, Srila Santana Gosvami and Srila Jiva Gosvami.
There is also a description of the meeting between $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu,
Srila Ripa Gosvami and Srila Sanatana Gosvami in the village known as
Ramakeli.

TRANSLATION

Both Ripa Gosvami and ऽ गारा माग Gosvami brought various scriptures
to Vrndavana and collected the essence of these by compiling many
scriptures on devotional service. In this way they delivered all rascals and
fallen souls.

The six gosvamis, under the direction of লও Rapa Gosvami and Srila
Sanatana Gosvami, studied various Vedic literatures and picked up the
essence of them, the devotional service of the Lord. This means that all the
gosvamis wrote many scriptures on devotional service with the support of
Vedic literature. Devotional service is not a sentimental activity. The essence

18 ভা Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 1
of Vedic knowledge is devotional service, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita:
vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah (Bg. 15.15). All the Vedic literature aims at
understanding Krsna, and how to understand Krsna through devotional ser-
vice has been explained by Srila Rapa and Sanatana Gosvamis, with evidence
from all Vedic literatures. They have put it so nicely that even a rascal or first-
class fool can be delivered by devotional service under the guidance of the
gosvamis.

TRANSLATION
The gosvamis carried out the preaching work of devotional service on
the basis of an analytical study of all confidential Vedic literatures. This
was in compliance with the order of इ Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Thus one
can understand the most confidential devotional service of Vrndivana.
PURPORT
This proves that bona fide devotional service is based on the conclusions
of Vedic literature. It is not based on the type of sentiment exhibited by the
prakrta-sahajiyas. The prakrta-sahajiyds do not consult the Vedic literatures,
and they are debauchees, woman hunters and smokers of gafja. Sometimes
they give a theatrical performance and cry for the Lord with tears in their
eyes. Of course, all scriptural conclusions are washed off by these tears. The
prakrta-sahajiyas do not realize that they are violating the orders of গা
Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who specifically said that to understand Vrndavana
and the pastimes of Vrndavana, one must have sufficient knowledge of the
dastras (Vedic literatures). As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam, bhaktya $ruta-

edge. Tac chraddadhanah munayah. Devotees who are actually serious attain
bhakti, scientific devotional service, by hearing Vedic literatures (bhaktya
Sruta-grhitayd). It is not that one should create something out of sentimen-
tality, become a sahajiya, and advocate such concocted devotional service.
However, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura considered such sahajiyas to
be more favorable than the impersonalists, who are hopelessly atheistic. The
impersonalists have no idea of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The
position of the sahajiyas is far better than that of the Mayavadi sannyasis. Al-
though the sahajiyas do not think much of Vedic knowledge, they nonethe-
less have accepted Lord Krsna as the Supreme Lord. Unfortunately, they
mislead others from authentic devotional service.

TRANSLATION
Some of the books compiled by Srila Sanitana Gosvami were Hari-
bhakti-vilisa, Bhagavatimrta, Daséama-tippani and Dasama-carita.
PURPORT
In the First Wave of the book known as Bhakti-ratndkara, it is said that
Sanatana Gosvami understood Srimad-Bhagavatam by thorough study and
explained it in his commentary known as Vaisnava-tosani. All the ae
that $rf Sanatana Gosvami and Rapa Gosvami directly acquired from Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu was broadcast all over the world by their expert ser-
vice. Sanatana Gosvami gave his Vaisnava-tosani commentary to Srila Jiva
Gosvami for editing, and Srila Jiva Gosvami edited this under the name of
Laghu-tosani. Whatever he immediately put down in writing was finished in

the year 1476 Saka. Srila Jiva Gosvami completed Laghu-tosani in the year
$akabda 1504.

The subject matter of Hari-bhakti-vilasa, by Sri Sanatana Gosvami, was col-
lected by Srila Gopala Bhatta Gosvami and is known as a vaispava-smrti. This
vaisnava-smrti-grantha was finished in twenty chapters, known as vilasas. In
the first vilasa there is a description of how a relationship is established be-
tween the spiritual master and the disciple, and mantras are explained. In the
second vildsa, the process of initiation is described. In the third vildsa, the
methods of Vaisnava behavior are given, with emphasis on cleanliness, con-
stant remembrance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the chanting
of the mantras given by the initiating spiritual master. In the fourth vilasa are
descriptions of sarhskara, the reformatory method; tilaka, the application of
twelve tilakas on twelve places of the body; mudra, marks on the body; mala,
chanting with beads; and guru-ptja, worship of the spiritual master. In the
fifth vildsa, one is instructed on how to make a place to sit for meditation, and
there are descriptions of breathing exercises, meditation and worship of the
Salagrama-$ila representation of Lord Visnu. In the sixth vildsa, the required
practices for inviting the transcendental form of the Lord and bathing Him are
given. In the seventh vildsa, one is instructed on how to collect flowers used
for the worship of Lord Visnu. In the eighth vildsa, there is a description of the
Deity and instructions on how to set up incense, light lamps, make offerings,
dance, play music, beat drums, garland the Deity, offer prayers and obei-
sances and counteract offenses. In the ninth ৮1353, there are descriptions
about collecting tulasi leaves, offering oblations to forefathers according to
Vaisnava rituals, and offering food. In the tenth vilasa there are descriptions of
the devotees of the Lord (Vaisnavas or saintly persons). In the eleventh vilasa,
there are elaborate descriptions of Deity worship and the glories of the holy
name of the Lord. One is instructed on how to chant the holy name of the
Deity, and there are discussions about offenses committed while chanting the
holy name, along with methods for getting relief from such offenses. There
are also descriptions of the glories of devotional service and the surrendering
process. In the twelfth vilasa, Ekadasi is described. In the thirteenth vilasa,
fasting is discussed, as well as observance of the Maha-dvadasi ceremony. In
the fourteenth vilasa, different duties for different months are outlined. In the
fifteenth vilasa, there are instructions on how to observe Ekadasi fasting with-
out even drinking water. There are also descriptions of branding the body
with the symbols of Visnu, and discussions of Caturmasya observations dur-
ing the rainy season, and discussions of Janmastami, Parévaikadasi, Sravana-
dvadasi, Rama-navami and Vijaya-dasami. The sixteenth vilasa discusses
duties to be observed in the month of Karttika (October-November), or the
Damodara month, or Urja, when lamps are offered in the Deity room or above


--- Page 22 ---
Text 35] The Later Pastimes of Lord Caitanya 21
the temple. There are also descriptions of the Govardhana-paja and Ratha-
yatra. The seventeenth vildsa discusses preparations for Deity worship, maha-
mantra chanting and the process of japa. In the eighteenth vilasa the different
forms of $f Visnu are described. The nineteenth vilisa discusses the
establishment of the Deity and the rituals observed in bathing the Deity
before installation. The twentieth vilasa discusses the construction of tem-
ples, referring to those constructed by the great devotees. The details of the
Hari-bhak ti-vilasa-grantha are given by Sri Kavirdja Gosvami in the Madhya-lila
(24.329-345). The descriptions given in those verses by Krsnadasa Kaviraja
Gosvami are actually a description of those portions compiled by Gopala
Bhatta Gosvami. According to Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura, the
regulative principles of devotional service compiled by GCopala Bhatta
Gosvami do not strictly follow our Vaisnava principles. Actually, Gopala Bhat-
ta Gosvami collected only a summary of the elaborate descriptions of
Vaisnava regulative principles from Hari-bhakti-vilasa. It is Srila Bhaktisiddhan-
ta Sarasvati Gosvami’s opinion, however, that to follow the Hari-bhakti-vilasa
strictly is to actually follow the Vaisnava rituals in perfect order. He claims that
the smarta-samaja, which is strictly followed by caste bradhmanas, has in-
fluenced portions that Gopala Bhatta Gosvami collected from the original
Hari-bhakti-vilasa. It is therefore very difficult to find out Vaisnava directions
from the book of Gopala Bhatta Gosvami. It is better to consult the commen-
tary made by Sanatana Gosvami himself for Hari-bhakti-vilasa under the
name of Dig-darsini-tika. Some say that the same commentary was compiled
by Gopinatha-paja Adhikari, who was engaged in the service of ऽ Radha-
ramanaji and who happened to be one of the disciples of Gopala Bhatta
Gosvami.

Regarding Brhad-bhagavatamrta, there are two parts dealing with the dis-
charge of devotional service. The first part is an analytical study of devotional
service, in which there is also a description of different planets, including the
earth, the heavenly planets, Brahma-loka and Vaikuntha-loka. There are also
descriptions of the devotees, including intimate devotees, most intimate
devotees and complete devotees. The second part describes the glories of
the spiritual world, known as Goloka-mahatmya-nirdpana, as well as the pro-
cess of renunciation of the material world. It also describes real knowledge,
devotional service, the spiritual world, love of Godhead, attainment of life's
destination, and the bliss of the world. In this way there are seven chapters in
each part, fourteen chapters in all.

Dasama-tippani is a commentary on the Tenth Canto of S$rimad-
Bhagavatam. Another name for this commentary is Brhad-vaispava-tosani-
tika. In the Bhakti-ratnakara, it is said that Dasama-tippani was finished in
1476 Sakabda.

PURPORT

Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati has given a description of these books.
Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu is a great book of instruction on how to develop
devotional service to Lord Krsna and follow the transcendental process. It
was finished in the year 1463 5३८३0५2. This book is divided into four parts:
parva-vibhaga (eastern division), daksina-vibhaga (southem division),
pascima-vibhaga (western division) and uttara-vibhaga (northern division). In
the parva-vibhaga, there is a description of the permanent development of
devotional service. The general principles of devotional service, the execution
of devotional service, ecstasy in devotional service and ultimately the attain-
ment of love of Godhead are described. In this way there are four laharis
(waves) in this division of the ocean of the nectar of devotion.

In the daksina-vibhaga (southern division) there is a general description of
the mellow (relationship) called bhakti-rasa, which is derived from devotional
service. There are also descriptions of the stages known as vibhava, anubhava,
sattvika, vyabhicari and sthdyi-bhava, all on this high platform of devotional
service. Thus there are five waves in the daksina-vibhaga division. In the
western division (pascima-vibhaga) there is a description of the chief tran-
scendental humors derived from devotional service. These are known as
mukhya-bhakti-rasa-nirapana, or attainment of the chief humors or feelings in
the execution of devotional service. In that part there is a description of
devotional service in neutrality, further development in love and affection


--- Page 26 ---
Text 41] The Later Pastimes of Lord Caitanya 25
(called servitude), further development in fraternity, further development in
paternity, or paternal love, and finally conjugal love between Krsna and His
devotees. Thus there are five waves in the western division.

In the northern division (uttara-vibhaga) there is a description of the in-
direct mellows of devotional service —namely, devotional service in laughter,
devotional service in wonder, and devotional service in chivalry, pity, anger,
dread and ghastliness. There are also mixing of mellows and the transgression
of different humors. Thus there are nine waves in this part. This is but a brief
outline of Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu.

Vidagdha-madhava is a drama of Lord Krsna's pastimes in Vrndavana. 51112
Rapa Gosvami finished this book in the year 1454 Sakabda. The first part of
this drama is called vepu-nada-vilasa, the second part manmatha-lekha, the
third part radha-sanga, the fourth part vepu-harana, the fifth part radha-
prasadana, the sixth part sarad-vihdra, and the seventh and last part gauri-
vihara.

There is also a book called Ujjvala-nilamani, a transcendental account of
loving affairs that includes metaphor, analogy and higher bhakti sentiments.
Devotional service in conjugal love is described briefly in Bhakti-rasamrta-
sindhu, but it is very elaborately discussed in Ujjvala-nilamani. This book de-
scribes different types of lovers, their assistants, and those who are very dear
to Krsna. There is also a description of नाव Radharani and other female
lovers, as well as various group leaders. Messengers and the constant associ-
ates, as well as others who are very dear to Krsna, are all described. The book
also relates how love of Krsna is awakened and describes the ecstatic situa-
tion, the devotional situation, permanent ecstasy, disturbed ecstasy, steady
ecstasy, different positions of different dresses, feelings of separation, prior at-
traction, anger in attraction, varieties of loving affairs, separation from the
beloved, meeting with the beloved, and both direct and indirect enjoyment
between the lover and the beloved. All this has been very elaborately de-
scribed.

Similarly, Lalita-madhava is a description of Krsna's pastimes in Dvaraka.
These pastimes were made into a drama, and the work was finished in the
year 1459 Sakabda. The first part deals with festivities in the evening, the sec-
ond with the killing of the Sankhaciida, the third with maddened $rimati
Radharani, the fourth with Radharant’s proceeding toward Krsna, the fifth
with the achievement of Candravali, the sixth with the achievement of Lalita,
the seventh with the meeting in Nava-vrndavana, the eighth with the enjoy-
ment in Nava-vrndavana, the ninth with looking over pictures, and the tenth
with complete satisfaction of the mind. Thus the entire drama is divided into
ten parts.


--- Page 27 ---
26 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 1

The Laghu-bhagavatamrta is divided into two parts. The first is called “The
Nectar of Krsna” and the second “The Nectar of Devotional Service!’ The im-
portance of Vedic evidence is stressed in the first part, and this is followed by
a description of the original form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead as
$ri Krsna and descriptions of His pastimes and expansions in svarisa (personal
forms) and vibhinnarnsa. According to different absorptions, the incarnations
are called avesa and tad-ekatma. The first incarnation is divided into three
purusavataras—namely, Maha-Visnu, Garbhodakasayi Visnu and
KsirodakasayT Visnu. Then there are the three incarnations of the modes of
nature—namely, Brahma, Visnu and Mahe$vara (Siva). All the paraphernalia
used in the service of the Lord is transcendental, beyond the three qualities of
this material world. There is also a description of twenty-five lild-avataras,
namely Catuhsana (the Kumaras), Narada, Vardha, Matsya, Yajiia, Nara-
narayana Rsi, Kapila, Dattatreya, Hayagriva, Harhsa, Prénigarbha, Rsabha,
Prthu, Nrsirhha, Karma, Dhanvantari, Mohini, Vamana, ParaSurama, Dasarathi,
Krsna-dvaipdyana, Balarama, Vasudeva, Buddha and Kalki. There are also
fourteen incarnations of Manu: Yajiia, Vibhu, Satyasena, Hari, Vaikuntha,
Ajita, Vamana, Sarvabhauma, Rsabha, Visvaksena, Dharmasetu, Sudhama,
Yogesvara and Brhadbhanu. There are also four incarnations for the four
yugas, and their colors are described as white, red, blackish and black
(sometimes yellow, as in the case of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu). There are
different types of millenniums and incarnations for those millenniums. The
categories called avesa, prabhava, vaibhava and para constitute different
situations for the different incarnations. According to specific pastimes, the
names are spiritually empowered. There are also descriptions of the dif-
ference between the powerful and the power, and the inconceivable ac-
tivities of the Supreme Lord.

$11 Krsna is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, and no one is
greater than Him. He is the source of all incarnations. In the Laghu-
bhagavatamrta there are descriptions of His partial incarnations, a description
of the impersonal Brahman effulgence (actually the bodily effulgence of ऽन
Krsna), the superexcellence of गा Krsna's pastimes as an ordinary human
being with two hands, and so forth. There is nothing to compare with the
two-armed form of the Lord. In the spiritual world (vaikuntha-jagat) there is
no distinction between the owner of the body and the body itself. In the ma-
terial world the owner of the body is called the soul, and the body is called a
material manifestation. In the Vaikuntha world, however, there is no such dis-
tinction. Lord ऽत Krsna is unborn, and His appearance as an incarnation is per-
petual. Krsna's pastimes are divided into two parts—manifest and un-


--- Page 28 ---
Text 43] The Later Pastimes of Lord Caitanya 27
manifest. For example, when Krsna takes His birth within this material world,
His pastimes are considered to be manifest. However, when He disappears,
one should not think that He is finished, for His pastimes are going on in an
unmanifest form. Varieties of humors, however, are enjoyed by the devotees
and Lord Krsna during His manifest pastimes. After all, His pastimes in
Mathura, Vindavana and Dvaraka are eternal and are going on perpetually
somewhere in some part of the universe.

TRANSLATION

In $ri Bhagavata-sandarbha, Srila Jiva Gosvami has written conclusively

about the ultimate end of devotional service.
PURPORT

Bhagavata-sandarbha is also known as Sat-sandarbha. In the first part, called
Tattva-sandarbha, it is proved that $rimad-Bhagavatam is the most authorita-
tive evidence directly pointing to the Absolute Truth. The second sandarbha,
called Bhagavat-sandarbha, draws a distinction between impersonal Brahman
and localized Paramatma and describes the spiritual world and the domina-
tion of the mode of goodness devoid of contamination by the other two ma-
terial modes. In other words, there is a vivid description of the transcendental
position known as suddha-sattva. Material goodness is apt to be contami-
nated by the other two material qualities—ignorance and passion—but
when one is situated in the suddha-sattva position, there is no chance for
such contamination. It is a spiritual platform of pure goodness. The potency
of the Supreme Lord and the living entity is also described, and there is a de-
scription of the inconceivable energies and varieties of energies of the Lord.
The potencies are divided into categories—internal, external, personal,
marginal and so forth. There are also discussions of the eternality of Deity
worship, the omnipotence of the Deity, His all-pervasiveness, His giving
shelter to everyone, His subtle and gross potencies, His personal manifesta-
tions, His expressions of form, quality and pastimes, His transcendental posi-
tion and His complete form. It is also stated that everything pertaining to the
Absolute has the same potency and that the spiritual world, the associates in
the spiritual world and the threefold energies of the Lord in the spiritual world
are all transcendental. There are further discussions concerning the difference
between the impersonal Brahman and the Personality of Godhead, the full-
ness of the Personality of Godhead, the objective of all Vedic knowledge, the
personal potencies of the Lord, and the Personality of Godhead as the original
author of Vedic knowledge.

The third sandarbha is called Paramatma-sandarbha, and in this book there
is a description of Paramatma (the Supersoul) and an explanation of how the
Supersoul exists in millions and millions of living entities. There are discussions
of the differences between the qualitative incarnations, and discourses con-
cerning the living entities, mays, the material world, the theory of transforma-
tion, the illusory energy, the sameness of this world and the Supersoul, and
the truth about this material world. In this connection, the opinions of
Sridhara Svami are given. It is stated that the Supreme Personality of God-


--- Page 30 ---
Text 43] The Later Pastimes of Lord Caitanya 29
head, although devoid of material qualities, superintends all material ac-
tivities. There is also a discussion of how the lil3-avatara incarnations respond
to the desires of the devotees and how the Supreme Personality of Godhead
is characterized by six opulences.

The fourth sandarbha is called the Krspa-sandarbha, and in this book Krsna
is proved to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There are discussions of
Krsna's pastimes and qualities, His superintendence of the purusa-avataras,
and so forth. The opinions of $ridhara Svami are corroborated. In each and
every scripture, the supremacy of Krsna is stressed. Baladeva, Sankarsana and
other expansions of Krsna are emanations of Maha-Sankarsana. All the incar-
nations and expansions exist simultaneously in the body of Krsna, who is de-
scribed as two-handed. There are also descriptions of the Goloka planet,
Vrndavana (the eternal place of Krsna), the identity of Goloka and Vrndavana,
the Yadavas and the cowherd boys (both eternal associates of Krsna), the ad-
justment and equality of the manifest and unmanifest pastimes, 67 Krsna's
manifestation in Gokula, the queens of Dvaraka as expansions of the internal
potency, and, superior to them, the superexcellent gopis. There is also a list of
the gopis’ names and a discussion of the topmost position of Srimati
Radharani.

The fifth sandarbha is called Bhakti-sandarbha, and in this book there is a
discussion of how devotional service can be directly executed, and how such
service can be adjusted, either directly or indirectly. There is a discussion of
the knowledge of all kinds of scripture, the establishment of the Vedic institu-
tion of varnasrama, bhakti as superior to fruitive activity, and so forth. It is also
stated that without devotional service, even a brihmana is condemned.
There are discussions of the process of karma-tyaga (the giving of the results
of karma to the Supreme Personality of Godhead), and the practices of mystic
yoga and philosophical speculation, which are deprecated as simply hard
labor. Worship of the demigods is discouraged, and worship of a Vaisnava is
considered exalted. No respect is given to the nondevotees. There are discus-
sions of how one can be liberated even in this life (jivan-mukta), Lord Siva as a
devotee, and how a bhakta and his devotional service are eternally existing. It
is stated that through bhakti one can attain all success, for bhakti is transcen-
dental to the material qualities. There is a discussion of how the self is
manifest through bhakti. There is also a discussion of the 59165 bliss, as well as
how bhakti, even imperfectly executed, enables one to attain the lotus feet
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Unmotivated devotional service is
highly praised, and an explanation is given of how each devotee can achieve
the platform of unmotivated service by association with other devotees.
There is a discussion of the differences between the maha-bhagavata and the

30 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 1
ordinary devotee, the symptoms of philosophical speculation, the symptoms
of self-worship, or aharigrahopasans, the symptoms of devotional service, the
symptoms of imaginary perfection, the acceptance of regulative principles,
service to the spiritual master, the maha-bhagavata (liberated devotee) and
service to him, service to Vaisnavas in general, the principles of hearing,
chanting, remembering and serving the lotus feet of the Lord, offenses in wor-
ship, offensive effects, prayers, engaging oneself as an eternal servant of the
Lord, making friendships with the Lord and surrendering everything for His
pleasure. There is also a discussion of raganuga-bhakti (spontaneous love of
Godhead), of the specific purpose of becoming a devotee of Lord Krsna, and
a comparative study of other perfectional stages.

The sixth sandarbha is called Priti-sandarbha, a thesis on love of Godhead.
Here it is stated that through love of Godhead, one becomes perfectly liber-
ated and attains the highest goal of life. A distinction is made between the
liberated condition of a personalist and that of an impersonalist, and there is a
discussion of liberation during one’s lifetime as distinguished from liberation
from material bondage. Of all kinds of liberation, liberation in loving service to
the Lord is described as the most exalted, and meeting the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead face to face is shown to be the highest perfection of life.
Immediate liberation is contrasted with liberation by a gradual process. Both
realization of Brahman and meeting with the Supreme Personality of God-
head are described as liberation within one’s lifetime, but meeting with the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, both internally and externally, is shown to
be superexcellent, above the transcendental realization of the Brahman
effulgence. There is a comparative study of liberation as salokya, sdmipya and
sarapya. Samipya is better than salokya. Devotional service is considered to
be liberation with greater facilities, and there is a discussion of how to obtain
it. There are also discussions of the transcendental state one achieves after at-
taining the devotional platform, which is the exact position of love of God-
head; the marginal symptoms of transcendental love, and how it is
awakened; the distinction between so-called love and transcendental love
on the platform of love of Godhead; and different types of humors and
mellows enjoyed in relishing the lusty affairs of the gopis, which are different
from mundane affairs, which in turn are symbolical representations of pure
love for Krsna. There are also discussions of bhakti mixed with philosophical
speculation, the superexcellence of the love of the gopis, the difference be-
tween opulent devotional service and loving devotional service, the exalted
position of the residents of Gokula, the progressively exalted position of the
friends of Krsna, the gopas and the gopis in parental love with Krsna, and
finally the superexcellence of the love of the gopis and that of Srimatt

Text 44] The Later Pastimes of Lord Caitanya 31
Radharani. There is also a discussion of how spiritual feelings can be present
when one simply imitates them and of how such mellows are far superior to
the ordinary mellows of mundane love, and there are descriptions of different
ecstasies, the awakening of ecstasy, transcendental qualities, the distinction
of dhirodatta, the utmost attractiveness of conjugal love, the ecstatic
features, the permanent ecstatic features, the mellows divided in five tran-
scendental features of direct loving service, and indirect loving service, con-
sidered in seven divisions. Finally there is a discussion of overlapping of dif-
ferent rasas, and there are discussions of santa (neutrality), servitorship, taking
shelter, parental love, conjugal love, direct transcendental enjoyment and en-
joyment in separation, previous attraction and the glories of Srimati
Radharani.

cried for Him the rest of their lives, feeling intense separation from Him. This
ecstatic feeling of separation was specifically advocated by Lord Caitanya
Mahaprabhu through His actual demonstrations.

When Krsna was performing yajiia (sacrifice) at Kuruksetra, He invited all
the inhabitants of Vrndavana to come see Him. Lord Caitanya’s heart was al-
ways filled with separation from Krsna, but as soon as He had the opportunity
to visit the Jagannatha temple, He became fully absorbed in the thoughts of
the gopis who came to see Krsna at Kuruksetra.

PURPORT
In $rimad-Bhagavatam (10.29.15) it is stated:
kamarn krodham bhayarih sneham
aikyar sauhrdam eva ca
nityarn harau vidadhato
yanti tanmayatam hi te
The word kama means lusty desire, bhaya means fear, and krodha means
anger. If one somehow or other approaches Krsna, his life becomes suc-
cessful. The gopis approached Krsna with lusty desire. Krsna was a very
beautiful boy, and they wanted to meet and enjoy His company. But this lusty
desire is different from that of the material world. It appears like mundane
lust, but in actuality it is the highest form of attraction to Krsna. Caitanya
Mahaprabhu was a sannyasi; He left home and everything else. He could cer-
tainly not be induced by any mundane lusty desires. So when He uses the
word madana-dahane (“in the fire of lusty desire’), He means that out of pure
love for Krsna He was burning in the fire of separation from Krsna. Whenever
He met Jagannatha, either in the temple or during the Ratha-yatra, Caitanya
Mahaprabhu used to think, “Now | have gotten the Lord of My life and soul’

heart.

PURPORT
Being always absorbed in the ecstasy of $rimati Radharani, গা Caitanya
Mahaprabhu felt the same separation from Krsna that $rimati Radharant felt
when Krsna left Vindavana and went to Mathura. This ecstatic feeling is very
helpful in attaining love of God in separation. $f Caitanya Mahaprabhu has
taught everyone that one should not be overly anxious to see the Lord, but
should rather feel separation from Him in ecstasy. It is actually better to feel
separation from Him than to desire to see Him face to face. When the gopis
of Vrndavana, the residents of Gokula, met Krsna at Kuruksetra during the
solar eclipse, they wanted to take Krsna back to Vindavana. তা Krsna
Caitanya Mahaprabhu also felt the same ecstasy as soon as He saw Jagan-
73073 in the temple or on the Ratha-yatra cart. The gopis of Vindavana did
not like the opulence of Dvaraka. They wanted to take Krsna to the village of
Vrndavana and enjoy His company in the groves. This desire was also felt by
ऽ Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and He danced in ecstasy before the Ratha-yatra
festival when Lord Jagannatha went to Gundica.

eager to go back to that place on the bank of the Reva under the Vetasi
tree. That is my desire.”

This verse appears in the Padyavali (382), by Srila Ripa Gosvam.

44 $ri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-Iila, Ch. 1
TRANSLATION

To avoid turmoil, three great personalities —Haridasa Thakura, Srila
Ripa Gosvami and Srila Sanitana Gosvami—did not enter the temple of
Jagannatha.

PURPORT

It is still the practice at Jagannatha temple not to allow those to enter who
do not strictly follow the Vedic culture known as Hinduism. $rila Haridasa
Thakura, $rila Rupa Gosvami and Srila Sanatana Gosvami had had previous in-
timate connections with Mohammedans. Haridasa Thakura had been born in
a Mohammedan family, and Srila Rapa Gosvami and Srila Sanatana Gosvami,
having given up their social status in Hindu society, had been appointed
ministers in the Mohammedan government. They had even changed their
names to Sakara Mallika and Dabira Khasa. Thus they had supposedly been
expelled from brahmana society. Consequently, out of humility, they did not
enter the temple of Jagannatha, although the Personality of Godhead, Jagan-
73078, in His form of Caitanya Mahaprabhu, personally came to see them
every day. Similarly, the members of this Krsna consciousness society are
sometimes refused entrance into some of the temples in India. We should not
feel sorry about this as long as we engage in chanting the Hare Krsna mantra.
Krsna Himself associates with devotees who are chanting His holy name, and
there is no need to be unhappy over not being able to enter a certain temple.
Such dogmatic prohibitions were not approved by Lord Caitanya
Mahaprabhu. Those who were thought unfit to enter Jagannatha temple
were daily visited by Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and this indicates that Caitanya
Mahaprabhu did not approve of the prohibitions. To avoid unnecessary tur-
moil, however, these great personalities would not enter Jagannatha temple.

Text 66] The Later Pastimes of Lord Caitanya 45
TRANSLATION
Every day Sri Caitanya Mahiprabhu used to see the upala-bhoga
ceremony at the temple of Jagannatha, and after seeing this, He used to go
visit these three great personalities on His way to His own residence.
PURPORT
Upala-bhoga is a particular type of offering performed just behind the
Caruda-stamba on a stone slab. That stone slab is called the upala. All food is
offered within the temple room just below the altar of Jagannatha. This
bhoga, however, was offered on the stone slab within the vision of the
public; therefore it is called upala-bhoga.

After reading the verse, $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu went into an ecstatic
mood. While He was in that state, Srila Ripa Gosvami came and im-
mediately fell down on the floor like a rod.
PURPORT
The word 03093 means rod or pole. A rod or pole falls straight; similarly,
when one offers obeisances to his superior with all eight angas (parts) of the
body, he performs what is called dangavat. Sometimes we only speak of dan-
davats but actually do not fall down. In any case, dandavat means falling
down like a rod before one’s superior.

Having shown the verse to Svariipa Damodara with great wonder,
Caitanya Mahaprabhu asked him how Ripa Gosvami could understand

PURPORT
We had the opportunity to receive a similar blessing from Srila Bhakti-
siddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami when we presented an essay at his birthday
ceremony. He was so pleased with that essay that he used to call some of his
confidential devotees and show it to them. How could we have understood

TRANSLATION
The gopis thought: “Dear Lord, if Your lotus feet again come to our
home in Vrndavana, our desires will be fulfilled.”
PURPORT
In his Anubhasya, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura comments: “The
gopis are purely engaged in the service of the Lord without motive. They are
not captivated by the opulence of Krsna, nor by the understanding that He is
the Supreme Personality of Godhead!” Naturally the gopis were inclined to
love Krsna, for He was an attractive young boy of Vrndavana village. Being
village girls, they were not very much attracted to the field of Kuruksetra,
where Krsna was present with elephants, horses and royal dress. Indeed, they
did not very much appreciate Krsna in that atmosphere. Krsna was not at-
tracted by the opulence or personal beauty of the gopls but by their pure
devotional service. Similarly, the gopls were attracted to Krsna as a cowherd
boy, not in sophisticated guise. Lord Krsna is inconceivably powerful. To
understand Him, great yogis and saintly persons give up all material engage-
ments and meditate upon Him. Similarly, those who are overly attracted to
material enjoyment, to enhancement of material opulence, to family mainte-
nance or to liberation from the entanglements of this material world take

shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But such activities and
motivations are unknown to the goplis; they are not at all expert in executing
such auspicious activities. Already transcendentally enlightened, they simply
engage their purified senses in the service of the Lord in the remote village of
Vrndavana. The gopis are not interested in dry speculation, in the arts, in
music, or other conditions of material life. They are bereft of all understanding
of material enjoyment and renunciation. Their only desire is to see Krsna
return and enjoy spiritual, transcendental pastimes with them. The gopis
want Him simply to stay in Vrndavana so that they can render service unto
Him, for His pleasure. There is not even a tinge of personal sense gratification.

enjoy Your pastimes, with Your flute dancing on Your lips, and surrounded
by us, the gopis, whose hearts are always enchanted by unpredictable
ecstatic emotions.”

58 $ri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lili, Ch. 1
TRANSLATION
Just as Srimati Radharini talked inconsistently with a bumblebee in the
presence of Uddhava, Sri Caitanya Mahiprabhu in His ecstasy talked
crazily and inconsistently day and night.
PURPORT
This unmada (madness) is not ordinary madness. When $i Caitanya
Mahaprabhu talked inconsistently, almost like a crazy fellow, He was in the
transcendental ecstasy of love. In the highest transcendental ecstasy there is
a feeling of being enchanted in the presence of the enchanter. When the
enchanter and the enchanted become separated, mohana, or bewilderment,
occurs. When so bewildered due to separation, one becomes stunned, and at
that time all the bodily symptoms of transcendental ecstasy are manifested.
When they are manifest, one appears inconceivably crazy. This is called tran-
scendental madness. In this state, there is imaginative discourse, and one ex-
periences emotions like those of a madman. The madness of Srimati
Radharani was explained to Krsna by Uddhava, who said, “My dear Krsna, be-
cause of extreme feelings of separation from You, Srimati Radharant is some-
times making Her bed in the groves of the forest, sometimes rebuking a bluish
cloud, and sometimes wandering about in the dense darkness of the forest.
Thus She has become like a crazy woman!”

SYNONYMS

prathama—first; satra—synopsis; prabhura—of the Lord; sannyasa-
karapa—accepting the sannyasa order; sannydsa kari’—after accepting the
renounced order; calili—went; prabhu—the Lord; $ri-vrndavana—toward
Vindavana.

TRANSLATION

This is the first synopsis: After accepting the sannyasa order, Caitanya

Mahaprabhu proceeded toward Vrndavana.
PURPORT

Clearly these statements are a real account of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s
acceptance of the renounced order of life. His acceptance of this renounced
order is not at all comparable to the acceptance of sannydsa by Mayavadis.
After accepting sannyasa, Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s aim was to reach
Vrndavana. He was unlike the Mayavadi sannydsis, who desire to merge into
the existence of the Absolute. For a Vaisnava, acceptance of sannydsa means
getting relief from all material activities and completely devoting oneself to
the transcendental loving service of the Lord. This is confirmed by Srila Rapa
Gosvami (B.r.s. 1.2.255): andsaktasya visayan yatharham upayudijatah/ nir-
bandhah krsna-sambandhe yuktarh vairagyam ucyate. For a Vaisnava, the
renounced order means completely giving up attachment for material things
and engaging nonstop in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. The
Mayavadi sannyasis, however, do not know how to engage everything in the
service of the Lord. Because they have no devotional training , they think ma-
terial objects to be untouchable. Brahma-satyarh jagan-mithya. The
Mayavadis think that the world is false, but the Vaisnava sannyasis do not
think like this. Vaisnavas say, “Why should the world be false? It is reality, and
it is meant for the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead!” For a
Vaisnava sannydsi, renunciation means not accepting anything for personal
sense enjoyment. Devotional service means engaging everything for the
satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION
After three days, Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu came to the house of
Advaita Acarya at Santipura and accepted alms there. This was His first
acceptance of alms. At night He performed congregational chanting
there.
PURPORT
It appears that in His transcendental ecstasy, $1 Caitanya Mahaprabhu
forgot to eat for three continuous days. He was then misled by Nityananda
Prabhu, who said that the River Ganges was the Yamuna. Because the Lord
was in the ecstasy of going to Vindavana, He was engladdened to see the
Yamuna, although in actuality the river was the Ganges. In this way the Lord
was brought to the house of Advaita Prabhu at Santipura after three days,
and He accepted food there. As long as the Lord remained there, He saw His
mother, Sacidevi, and every night executed congregational chanting with all
the devotees.

Text 96] The Later Pastimes of Lord Caitanya 63
PURPORT
गं Caitanya Mahaprabhu knew very well that His acceptance of sannyasa
was a thunderbolt for His mother. He therefore called for His mother and the
devotees from Mayapura, and by the arrangement of आ Advaita Acirya, He
met them for the last time after His acceptance of sannydsa. His mother was
overwhelmed with grief when she saw that He was clean-shaven. There was
no longer any beautiful hair on His head. Mother Sac was pacified by all the
devotees, and Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu asked her to cook for Him because
He was very hungry, not having taken anything for three days. His mother im-
mediately agreed, and, forgetting everything else, she cooked for $rf Caitanya
Mahaprabhu during all the days she was at the house of $rf Advaita Prabhu.
Then, after a few days, ऽ Caitanya Mahaprabhu requested His mother's per-
mission to go to Jagannatha Puri. At His mother’s request, He made Jagan-
natha Puri His headquarters after His acceptance of sannydsa. Thus every-
thing was adjusted, and with His mother's permission अआ Caitanya
Mahaprabhu proceeded toward Jagannatha Puri.

This Ksira-curi Gopinatha is situated about five miles away from the
Balesvara station on the Northeastern Railway, formerly known as the Bengal-
Mayapura Railway. This station is situated a few miles away from the famous
Kargapura Junction station. Sometimes the charge of the temple was given to
Syamasundara Adhikari from Gopivallabhapura, which lies on the border of
the district of Medinipura. Syamasundara Adhikari was a descendant of
Rasikananda Murari, the chief disciple of Syamananda Gosvami.

A few miles before the Jagannatha Puri station is a small station called Sak-
si-gopala. Near this station is a village named Satyavadi, where the temple of
Saksi-gopala is situated.

Krsna; pracara—preaching.
TRANSLATION
After this, Krsnadasa, the servant of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu, was
delivered from the clutches of a Bhattathari. Caitanya Mahaprabhu then
preached that Lord Krsna’s name should also be chanted by brahmanas
who were accustomed to chanting Lord Rama’s name.
PURPORT
In the Mal3bara district, a section of the brahmanas are known as nam-
budri-brahmanas, and the Bhattatharis are their priests. Bhattatharis know
many tantric black arts, such as the art of killing a person, of bringing him
under submission, and of destroying or devastating him. They are very expert
in these black arts, and one such Bhattathari bewildered the personal servant
of ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu while the servant accompanied the Lord in His
travels through south India. Somehow or other $i Caitanya Mahaprabhu
delivered this Krsnadasa from the clutches of the Bhattathari. $ri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu is well known as Patita-pavana, the savior of all fallen souls, and
He proved this in His behavior toward His personal servant, Krsnadasa, whom
He saved. Sometimes the word Bhattathari is misspelled in Bengal as Bhat-
tamari.

In the olden days, there were no presses, and all the important scriptures
were hand-written and kept in large temples. Caitanya Mahaprabhu found
Brahma-samhita and Krsna-karpamrta in hand-written texts, and knowing
them to be very authoritative, He took them with Him to present to His devo-
tees. Of course, He obtained the permission of the temple commander. Now
both Brahma-samhita and Krspa-karpamrta are available in print with com-
mentaries by Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura.

--- Page 79 ---
78 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 1
there. At the present moment a police station and post office are situated
there because so many people come to see the temple.

The word anavasara is used when $i Jagannathaji cannot be seen in the
temple. After the bathing ceremony (sndna-yatrd, Lord Jagannatha is sup-
posed to become sick. He is therefore removed to His private apartment,
where no one can see Him. Actually, during this period renovations are made
on the body of the Jagannatha Deity. This is called nava-yauvana. During the
Ratha-yatra ceremony, Lord Jagannatha once again comes before the public.
Thus for fifteen days after the bathing ceremony, Lord Jagannatha is not vis-
ible to any visitors.

After due consideration, all the devotees began chanting the holy name
congregationally. Lord Caitanya’s mind was thus pacified by the ecstasy of

Being absolute, Lord Jagannatha is identical in person, form, picture, kirtana
and all other circumstances. Therefore when Caitanya Mahaprabhu heard the
chanting of the holy name of the Lord, He was pacified. Previously, He had
been feeling very morose due to separation from Jagannatha. The conclusion
is that whenever a kirtana of pure devotees takes place, the Lord is im-
mediately present. By chanting the holy names of the Lord, we associate with
the Lord personally.

TRANSLATION

With great assurance he then told the devotees that Lord Caitanya

would not go to Vrndavana at that time.
PURPORT

Srila Nrsirnhananda Brahmacari was a great devotee of Lord Caitanya
Mahaprabhu; therefore when he heard that from Kuliya अआ Caitanya
Mahaprabhu was going to Vrndavana, although he had no material wealth he
began to construct within his mind a very attractive path or road for Caitanya
Mahaprabhu to traverse. Some of the description of this path is given above.
But even mentally he could not construct the road beyond Kanai Natasala.
Therefore he concluded that Caitanya Mahaprabhu would not go to
Vrndavana at that time.

For a pure devotee, it is the same whether he materially constructs a path
or constructs one within his mind. This is because the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Janardana, is bhava-grahi, or appreciative of the sentiment. For Him
a path made with actual jewels and a path made of mental jewels are the
same. Though subtle, mind is also matter, so any path—indeed, anything for
the service of the Lord, whether in gross matter or in subtle matter—is ac-
cepted equally by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lordaccepts the
attitude of His devotee and sees how much he is prepared to serve Him. The
devotee is at liberty to serve the Lord either in gross matter or in subtle mat-
ter. The important point is that the service be in relation with the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (9.26):

patram puspam phalam toyam
yo me bhaktya prayacchati
tad aham bhakty-upahrtam
asnami prayatatmanah
“If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit or water, | will
accept it” The real ingredient is bhakti (devotion). Pure devotion is uncon-


--- Page 99 ---
98 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 1
taminated by the modes of material nature. Ahaituky apratihata: uncondi-
tional devotional service cannot be checked by any material condition. This
means that one does not have to be very rich to serve the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead. Even the poorest man can equally serve the Supreme
Personality of Godhead if he has pure devotion. If there is no ulterior motive,
devotional service cannot be checked by any material condition.

activities.

Ke$ava 07801 became a diplomat when questioned about जा Caitanya
Mahaprabhu. Although he knew everything about Him, he was afraid that the
Mohammedan King might become His enemy. He gave no importance to the
Lord's activities, so that the Mohammedan King would take Him to be an or-
dinary man and would not give Him any trouble.

sonality of Godhead is the proprietor of all planetary systems. In each and
every planet there must be some king, governmental head or executive. Such
a person is supposed to be the representative of Lord Visnu. On behalf of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, he must see to the interest of all the
people. Therefore Lord Visnu, as Paramatma, gives the king all intelligence to
execute governmental affairs. Srila Ripa Gosvami therefore asked the King
what was in his mind concerning ৩11 Caitanya Mahaprabhu and indicated that
whatever the King thought about Him was correct.

112 Sri Caitanya-caritimrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 1
PURPORT
Although the two brothers, Ripa and Sanatana (at that time Dabira Khasa
and Sakara Mallika), presented themselves as being born in a low family, they
nonetheless belonged to a most respectable brahmana family that was
originally from Karnata. Thus they actually belonged to the brahmana caste.
Unfortunately, because of being associated with the Mohammedan govern-
mental service, their customs and behavior resembled those of the Moham-
medans. Therefore they presented themselves as nica-jati. The word jati
means birth. According to $astra, there are three kinds of birth. The first birth
is from the womb of the mother, the second birth is the acceptance of the
reformatory method, and the third birth is acceptance by the spiritual master
(initiation). One becomes abominable by adopting an abominable profession
or by associating with people who are naturally abominable. Rapa and
Sanitana, as Dabira Khasa and Sakara Mallika, associated with Moham-
medans, who were naturally opposed to brahminical culture and cow protec-
tion. In Srimad-Bhagavatam (Seventh Canto) it is stated that every person
belongs to a certain classification. A person is identifiable by the special
symptoms mentioned in the $dstras. By one’s symptoms, one is known to
belong to a certain caste. Both Dabira Khasa and Sakara Mallika belonged to
the brahmana caste, but because they were employed by Mohammedans,
their original habits degenerated into those of the Mohammedan community.
Since the symptoms of brahminical culture were almost nil, they identified
themselves with the lowest caste. In the Bhakti-ratnakara it is clearly stated
that because Sakara Mallika and Dabira Khasa associated with lower-class
men, they introduced themselves as belonging to the lower classes. Actually,
however, they had been born in respectable brahmana families.

“^| गस and Madhai had but one fault—they were addicted to sinful ac-

PURPORT

672 Rupa Gosvami and Sanatana Gosvami presented themselves as being
lower than the two brothers Jagai and Madhai, who were delivered by ऽ
Caitanya Mahaprabhu. When Rapa and 52101212 compared themselves to
Jagai and Madhai, they found themselves inferior because the Lord had no
trouble in delivering two drunken brothers. This was so because, despite the
fact that they were addicted to sinful activity, in other ways their life was
brilliant. They belonged to the brdhmana caste of Navadvipa, and such
brahmanas were pious by nature. Although they had been addicted to some
sinful activities due to bad association, those unwanted things could vanish
simply because of the chanting of the holy name of the Lord. Another point
for Jagai and Madhai was that, as members of a brahmana family, they did not
accept service under anyone. The sastras strictly forbid a brahmana to accept
service under anyone. The idea is that by accepting a master, one accepts the
occupation of a dog. In other words, a dog cannot thrive without having a
master, and for the sake of pleasing the master, dogs offend many people.
They bark at innocent people just to please the master. Similarly, when one is
a servant, he has to perform abominable activities according to the orders of
the master. Therefore, when Dabira Khasa and Sakara Mallika compared their
position to that of Jagai and Madhai, they found Jagai and Madhai’s position
far better. Jagai and Madhai never accepted the service of a low-class person;
nor were they forced to execute abominable activities under the order of a
low-class master. Jagai and Madhai chanted the name of $1 Caitanya
Mahaprabhu by way of blasphemy, but because they simply chanted His
name, they immediately became free from the reactions of sinful activities.
Thus later they were saved.

“Actually we belong to the caste of meat-eaters because we are servants
of meat-eaters. Indeed, our activities are exactly like those of the meat-
eaters. Because we always associate with such people, we are inimical
toward the cows and brahmanas.”

PURPORT

There are two kinds of meat-eaters—one who is born in a family of meat-
eaters and one who has learned to associate with meat-eaters. From Srila
Rapa and 58173809178 Gosvamis (formerly Dabira Khasa and Sakara Mallika) we
can learn how one attains the character of a meat-eater simply by associating
with meat-eaters. At the present moment in India the presidential offices are
occupied by many so-called brahmanpas, but the state maintains
slaughterhouses for killing cows and makes propaganda against Vedic civiliza-
tion. The first principle of Vedic civilization is the avoidance of meat-eating
and intoxication. Presently in India, intoxication and meat-eating are en-
couraged, and the so-called learned brahmanas presiding over this state of
affairs have certainly become degraded according to the standard given
herein by Srila Ripa Gosvami and 58178309178 Gosvami. These so-called
brahmanas give sanction to slaughterhouses for the sake of a fat salary, and
they do not protest these abominable activities. By deprecating the principles
of Vedic civilization and supporting cow killing, they are immediately
degraded to the platform of mlecchas and yavanas. A mleccha is a meat-
eater, and a yavana is one who has deviated from Vedic culture. Unfor-
tunately, such mlecchas and yavanas are in executive power. How, then, can
there be peace and prosperity in the state? The king or the president must be
the representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When Maharaja
Yudhisthira accepted the rule of Bharata-varsa (formerly this entire planet, in-
cluding all the seas and land), he took sanction from authorities like
Bhismadeva and Lord Krsna. He thus ruled the entire world according to
religious principles. At the present moment, however, heads of state do not
care for religious principles. If irreligious people vote on an issue, even though


--- Page 119 ---
118 $ri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 1
it be against the principles of the sastras, the bills will be passed. The presi-
dent and heads of state become sinful by agreeing to such abominable ac-
tivities. Sanatana and २००३ Gosvamis pleaded guilty to such activities; they
therefore classified themselves among the mlecchas, although born in a
brahmana family.

SYNONYMS
mora—our; karma—activities; mora—our; hate—on the hand; galdya—on
the neck; bandhiyda—binding; ku-visaya—of abominable objects of sense
gratification; vistha—of the stool; garte—in the ditch; diyache pheldiya—
have been thrown.
TRANSLATION
The two brothers, Sikara Mallika and Dabira Khasa, very humbly sub-
mitted that due to their abominable activities, they were now bound by
the neck and hands and had been thrown into a ditch filled with abomi-
nable stool-like objects of material sense enjoyment.
PURPORT
Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura has explained ku-visaya garta as
follows: “Because of the activities of the senses, we become subjected to
many sense gratificatory processes and are thus entangled by the laws of ma-
terial nature.” This entanglement is called visaya. When the sense gratificatory
processes are executed by pious activity, they are called su-visaya. The word
su means “good,” and visaya means “sense objects!” When the sense grati-
ficatory activities are performed under sinful conditions, they are called ku-
visaya, bad sense enjoyment. In either case, either ku-visaya or su-visaya,
these are material activities. As such, they are compared to stool. In other
words, such things are to be avoided. To become free from su-visaya and ku-
visaya, one must engage himself in the transcendental loving service of Krsna,
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The activities of devotional service are


--- Page 120 ---
Text 198] The Later Pastimes of Lord Caitanya 119
free from the contamination of material qualities. Therefore, to be free from
the reactions of su-visaya and ku-visaya, one must take to Krsna conscious-
ness. In that way, one will save himself from contamination. In this connec-
tion, 612 Narottama dasa Thakura has sung:
karma-kanda, jiiana-kanda, kevala visera bhianda
amrta baliya yeba khaya
nana yoni sada phire, kadarya bhaksana kare
tira janma adhah-pate yaya
Su-visaya and ku-visaya both fall under the category of karma-kangda. There is
another kanda (platform of activity) called jAana-kanda, or philosophical
speculation about the effects of ku-visaya and su-visaya with the intention to
find out the means of deliverance from material entanglement. On the plat-
form of jiidna-kanda, one may give up the objects of ku-visaya and su-visaya.
But that is not the perfection of life. Perfection is transcendental to both
jAdna-kangda and karma-kanda; it is on the platform of devotional service. If
we do not take to devotional service in Krsna consciousness, we have to
remain within this material world and endure the repetition of birth and death
due to the effects of jAdna-kanda and karma-kanga. Therefore Narottama
dasa Thakura says:
nana yoni sada phire, kadarya bhaksana kare
tra janma adhah-pate ydya

“One travels throughout various species of life and eats all kinds of nonsense.
Thus he spoils his existence.” A man in material existence and attached to ku-
visaya or su-visaya is in the same position as that of a worm in stool. After all,
whether it be moist or dry, stool is stool. Similarly, material activities may be
either pious or impious, but because they are all material, they are compared
to stool. Worms cannot get out of stool by their own endeavor; similarly,
those who are overly attached to material existence cannot get out of mate-
rialism and suddenly become Krsna conscious. Attachment is there. As ex-
plained by Prahldda Maharaja in Srimad-Bhagavatam (7.5.30):

matir na krspe paratah svato va

mitho ‘bhipadyeta grha-vratanam
adanta-gobhir visatar tamisrari
punah punas carvita-carvananam


--- Page 121 ---
120 $ri Caitanya-caritimrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 1
“Those who have made up their minds to remain in this material world and
enjoy sense gratification cannot become Krsna conscious. Because of their at-
tachment to material activity, they cannot attain liberation, neither by the in-
structions of superior persons nor by their own endeavor, nor by passing
resolutions in big conferences. Because their senses are uncontrolled, they
gradually descend to the darkest regions of material existence to repeat the
same process of birth and death in desirable or undesirable species of life.”

PURPORT
In His teachings to Sanitana Gosvami, भा Caitanya Mahaprabhu has
declared every living entity to be an eternal servitor of the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead. This is the constitutional position of all living entities.
Just as a dog or servant is very satisfied to get a competent, perfect master, or
as a child is completely satisfied to possess a competent father, so the living
entity is satisifed by completely engaging in the service of the Supreme Lord.
He thereby knows that he has a competent master to save him from all kinds
of danger. Unless the living entity comes to the guaranteed protection of the
Supreme Lord, He is full of anxiety. This life of anxiety is called material exis-
tence. To be completely satisfied and devoid of anxiety, one must come to
the position of eternally कतवः service to the Supreme Lord. This verse is
also from the Stotra-ratna (43) by भा Yamunacarya.

“My dear Sakara Mallika, from this day your names will be changed to

PURPORT
Actually this is $rf Caitanya Mahaprabhu's initiation of Dabira Khasa and
Sakara Mallika. They approached the Lord with all humility, and the Lord ac-
cepted them as old servants, as eternal servants, and He changed their
names. It is to be understood from this that it is essential for a disciple to
change his name after initiation.

“After initiation, the disciple’s name must be changed to indicate that he is a
servant of Lord Visnu. The disciple should also immediately begin marking his
body with tilaka (ardhva-pundra), especially his forehead. These are spiritual
marks, symptoms of a perfect Vaispava’ This is a verse from the Padma
Purana, Uttara-khanda. A member of the sahajiyd-sampradiya does not
change his name; therefore he cannot be accepted as a Gaudiya Vaisnava. If
a person does not change his name after initiation, it is to be understood that
he will continue in his bodily conception of life.

TRANSLATION
When all of the devotees saw the mercy of the Lord upon the two
brothers, they were very gladdened, and they began to chant the holy
name of the Lord, “Hari! Hari!”
PURPORT
Srila Narottama dasa Thakura says, chadiya vaispava seva nistara peche
keba: unless one serves a Vaisnava, he cannot be delivered. The spiritual
master initiates the disciple to deliver him, and if the disciple executes the
order of the spiritual master and does not offend other Vaisnavas, his path is
clear. Consequently Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu requested all the Vaisnavas
present to show mercy toward the two brothers, Ripa and Sanatana, who
had just been initiated by the Lord. When a Vaisnava sees that another
Vaisnava is a recipient of the Lord’s mercy, he becomes very happy. Vaisnavas
are not envious. If a Vaisnava, by the mercy of the Lord, is empowered by
Him to distribute the Lord’s holy name all over the world, other Vaisnavas be-
come very joyful —that is, if they are truly Vaisnavas. One who is envious of
the success of a Vaisnava is certainly not a Vaisnava himself, but an ordinary
mundane man. Envy and jealousy are manifested by mundane people, not by
Vaisnavas. Why should a Vaisnava be envious of another Vaisnava who is
successful in spreading the holy name of the Lord? An actual Vaisnava is very
pleased to accept another Vaisnava who is bestowing the Lord's mercy. A

mundane person in the dress of a Vaisnava should not be respected but re-
jected. This is enjoined in the 4251125 (upeksd). The word upeksa means
neglect. One should neglect an envious person. A preacher's duty is to love
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, make friendships with Vaisnavas, show
mercy to the innocent and reject or neglect those who are envious or jealous.
There are many jealous people in the dress of Vaisnavas in this Krsna con-
sciousness movement, and they should be completely neglected. There is no
need to serve a jealous person who is in the dress of a Vaisnava. When Narot-
tama dasa Thakura says chadiya vaisnava 5९५३ nistira peche (८९0, he is in-
dicating an actual Vaisnava, not an envious or jealous person in the dress of a
Vaisnava.

TRANSLATION
In accordance with the instructions of Sri Caitanya Mahiprabhu, the
two brothers, Ripa and Sandtana, immediately touched the lotus feet of
these Vaisnavas, who all became very happy and congratulated the two
brothers for having received the mercy of the Lord.
PURPORT
This behavior is indicative of real Vaisnavas. When they saw that Rapa and
53173808173 were fortunate enough to receive the mercy of the Lord, they were
so pleased that they all congratulated the two brothers. A jealous person in
the dress of a Vaisnava is not at all happy to see the success of another
Vaisnava in receiving the Lord's mercy. Unfortunately in this age of Kali there
are many mundane persons in the dress of Vaisnavas, and $rila Bhaktivinoda
Thakura has described them as disciples of Kali. He says, kali-cela. He indi-
cates that there is another Vaisnava, a pseudo-Vaisnava with tilaka on his
nose and kunti beads around his neck. Such a pseudo-Vaisnava associates
with money and women and is jealous of successful Vaisnavas. Although
passing for a Vaisnava, his only business is earning money in the dress of a
Vaisnava. Bhaktivinoda Thakura therefore says that such a pseudo-Vaisnava
is not a Vaisnava at all but a disciple of Kali-yuga. A disciple of Kali cannot be-
come an acdrya by the decision of some high court. Mundane votes have no
jurisdiction to elect a Vaisnava dcarya. A Vaisnava acarya is self-effulgent,
and there is no need for any court judgment. A false dcarya may try to over-
ride a Vaisnava by a high-court decision, but Bhaktivinoda Thakura says that
he is nothing but a disciple of Kali-yuga.

PURPORT
Sometimes, for business purposes, large crowds of men are taken to dif-
ferent places of pilgrimage, and money is collected from them. That is a very
lucrative business, but Ripa and Sanatana Gosvamis, expressing their opinion
in the presence of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu, disapproved of such crowded
pilgrimages. Actually when Lord Caitanya visited Vrndavana, He visited it
alone and accepted a servant only at His devotees’ request. He never visited
Vrndavana with crowds of people for a commercial purpose.

--- Page 137 ---
136 $ri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 1
PURPORT
In those days in Bengal there were many places known as Kanai Natasala,
where pictures of the pastimes of Lord Krsna were kept. People used to go
there to see them. This is called krspa-caritra-Iila. In Bengal there are still many
places called hari-sabha, which indicates a place where local people gather to
chant the Hare Krsna maha-mantra and discuss the pastimes of Lord Krsna.
The word kandi means “Lord Krsna's,” and natasala indicates a place where
pastimes are demonstrated. So those places which at the present moment are
called hari-sabha may previously have been known as Kanai Natasala.

He desired by visiting such holy places in that way.

TRANSLATION
After this, the Lord punished the Junior Haridisa, and Damodara Pan-
dita gave some warning to the Lord.
PURPORT
Actually Damodara Pandita was the eternal servant of the Lord. He could
not punish the Lord at any time, nor had he any desire to, but He did give
some warning to the Lord so that others would not blaspheme Him. Of
course, He should have known that the Lord is the Supreme Personality of
Godhead and is free to act in any way. There is no need to warn Him, and
such an action is not very much appreciated by advanced devotees.

Soon afterward, Vallabha Bhatta met the Lord at Jagannitha Puri, and
the Lord explained to him the import of the holy name of Krsna.
PURPORT
This Vallabha Bhatta is the head of the Vaisnava sampradaya known as the
Vallabhacarya-sampradaya in western India. There is a long story about
Vallabha Acarya narrated in the Caitanya-caritamrta, specifically in the Sev-
enth Chapter of Antya-Iila and the Nineteenth Chapter of Madhya-/ila. Lord
Caitanya Mahaprabhu visited the house of Vallabha Acarya on the other side
of Prayaga in a place known as Adaila-grama. Later, Vallabha Bhatta saw
Caitanya Mahaprabhu at Jagannatha Puri to explain his commentary on
Srimad-Bhagavatam. He was very proud of his writings, but इ Caitanya
Mahaprabhu corrected him, telling him that a Vaisnava should be humble and
follow in the footsteps of his predecessors. The Lord told him that his pride in
being superior to Sridhara Svami was not at all befitting a Vaisnava.

TRANSLATION

Thus $ri Caitanya Mahiprabhu chastised all the devotees, telling them
not to show impudence and spoil the entire world by becoming indepen-
dent.

PURPORT

$11 Caitanya Mahaprabhu warned all His followers not to become indepen-
dent or impudent. Unfortunately, after the disappearance of Lord Caitanya
Mahaprabhu, many apa-sampradayas (so-called followers) invented many
ways not approved by the dcaryas. Bhaktivinoda Thakura has described them
as: the dula, baula, karttabhaji, nedd, daravesa, sani sahajiya, sakhibheki,
smarta, jata-gosani, ativadi, cidadhari and gauranga-nagari.

The aula-sampraddya, baula-sampraddya and others invented their own
ways of understanding Lord Caitanya’s philosophy without following in the
footsteps of the dcaryas. ऽ Caitanya Mahaprabhu Himself indicates herein
that all such attempts would simply spoil the spirit of His cult.

pastimes the Lord performed during the last twelve years.
PURPORT
Thus Srila Kaviraja Gosvami, strictly following in the footsteps of গা
Vyasadeva, gives a synopsis of the lilas of Caitanya-caritamrta. He has given
such a description at the end of each canto. In the Adi-1ild he outlined the
pastimes of the Lord in the five stages of boyhood, leaving the details of the
description to Srila Vindavana dasa Thakura. Now in this chapter the
pastimes that took place at the end of the Lord's life are summarized. These
are described in the Madhya-lila and Antya-lila. The rest of the pastimes have
been described in codes in the Second Chapter of Madhya-lila. In this way
the author has gradually described both the Madhya-lila and Antya-lila.

CHAPTER 2
The Ecstatic Manifestations
of Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu
In the Second Chapter of Madhya-lila, the author describes the pastimes the
Lord performed during the last twelve years of His life. Thus he has also de-
scribed some of the pastimes of Antya-lila. Why he has done so is very ती
ficult for an ordinary person to understand. The author expects that reading
the pastimes of the Lord will gradually help a person awaken his dormant love
of Krsna. Actually this Caitanya-caritamrta was compiled by the author during
very old age. Therefore the codes of Antya-lila are also described in the Sec-
ond Chapter. Srila Kavirdgja Gosvami has confirmed that the opinion of
53103 Damodara is authoritative in the matter of devotional service. Over
and above this are the notes of Svardpa Damodara, memorized by
Raghunatha dasa Gosvami, who also helped in the compilation of Caitanya-
caritamrta. After the disappearance of Svaripa Damodara Gosvami,
Raghunatha dasa Gosvami went to see Vrndavana. At that time the author,
Srila Kaviraja Gosvami, met Raghunatha dasa Gosvami, by whose mercy he
also could memorize all the notes. In this way the author was able to com-
plete this transcendental literature, Sr Caitanya-caritamrta.

TRANSLATION

While relating in synopsis form the last division of the pastimes of Lord
Caitanya Mahaprabhu, in this chapter | shall describe the Lord's transcen-
dental ecstasy, which appears like madness due to His separation from
Krsna.

PURPORT

In this Second Chapter, the activities of Lord Caitanya that took place after
the Lord accepted sannydsa are generally described. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu
is specifically mentioned here as being gaura, or of fair complexion. Krsna is
generally known to be blackish, but when He is absorbed in the thought of
the gopis, who are all of fair complexion, Krsna Himself also becomes fair. তা
Caitanya Mahaprabhu in particular felt separation from Krsna very deeply, ex-
actly like a lover who is dejected in separation from the beloved. Such feel-
ings, which were expressed by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu for nearly twelve
years at the end of His pastimes, are described in brief in this Second Chapter
of Madhya-lila.

Hill in Vindavana; bhrame —mistakes; dhafAa—running; cale—goes; arta-

Sri Caitanya Mahiaprabhu would also run very fast across the sandhills,
mistaking them to be Govardhana. As He ran, He would wail and cry
loudly.
PURPORT
Because of the winds of the sea, sometimes the sand would form dunes.
Such sand dunes are called cataka parvata. Instead of seeing these sand dunes
simply as hills of sand, the Lord would take them to be Govardhana Hill.
Sometimes He would run toward these dunes at high speed, crying very
loudly, expressing the state of mind exhibited by Radharani. Thus Caitanya
Mahaprabhu was absorbed in thoughts of Krsna and His pastimes. His state of
mind brought Him the atmosphere of Vindavana and Govardhana Hill, and
thus He enjoyed the transcendental bliss of separation and meeting.

The ecstatic transformations of the body as described in such exalted
literatures as Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu are practically not seen in this material
world. However, these symptoms were perfectly present in the body of ऽ
Caitanya Mahaprabhu. These symptoms are indicative of mahabhava, or the
highest ecstasy. Sometimes sahajiyas artificially imitate these symptoms, but
experienced devotees reject them immediately. The author admits herein
that these symptoms are not to be found anywhere but in the body of ऽत
Caitanya Mahaprabhu.

long enough to expect Krsna’s mercy?

“Of what use are eyes if one does not see the face of Krsna, which
resembles the moon and is the birthplace of all beauty and the reservoir of
the nectarean songs of His flute? Oh, let a thunderbolt strike his head!
Why does he keep such eyes?
PURPORT
The moonlike face of Krsna is the reservoir of nectarean songs and abode
of His flute. It is also the root of all bodily beauty. If the eyes of the gopis are
not engaged in seeing the beautiful face of Krsna, it is better that they be
struck by a thunderbolt. For the gopis, to see anything but Krsna is uninterest-
ing and, indeed, detestful. The gopis are never pleased to see anything but
Krsna. The only solace for their eyes is the beautiful moonlike face of Krsna,
the worshipful object of all senses. When they cannot see the beautiful face
of Krsna, they actually see everything as vacant, and they desire to be struck

not breathe? All around us, do the beasts not eat and discharge semen? Men
who are like dogs, hogs, camels and asses praise those men who never listen
to the transcendental pastimes of Lord Sri Krsna, the deliverer from evils. One
who has not listened to the messages about the prowess and marvelous acts
of the Personality of Godhead and has not sung or chanted loudly the worthy
songs about the Lord should be considered to possess ears like the holes of
snakes and a tongue like that of a frog. The upper portion of the body, though
crowned with a silk turban, is only a heavy burden if not bowed down before
the Personality of Godhead, who can award mukti [freedom]. And the hands,
though decorated with glittering bangles, are like those of a dead man if not
engaged in the service of the Personality of Godhead Hari. The eyes which do
not look at the symbolic representations of the Personality of Godhead Visnu
[His forms, name, quality, etc] are like those printed on the plumes of a
peacock, and the legs which do not move to the holy places [where the Lord
is remembered] are considered to be like tree trunks. The person who has not
at any time received upon his head the dust from the feet of a pure devotee
of the Lord is certainly a dead body. And the person who has never ex-
perienced the flavor of the {८1257 leaves from the lotus feet of the Lord is also
a dead body, although breathing. Certainly that heart is steel-framed which,
in spite of one’s chanting the holy name of the Lord with concentration, does

Lamenting in this way, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu opened the doors of
grief within His heart. Morose, humble and disappointed, He read a verse
again and again with a despondent heart.
PURPORT
In Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu, the word dainya (humility) is explained as
follows: “When unhappiness, fearfulness and the sense of having offended
combine, one feels condemned. This sense of condemnation is described as
dinata, humility. When one is subjected to such humility, he feels bodily inac-
tive, he apologizes, and his consciousness is disturbed. His mind is also rest-
less, and many other symptoms are visible!’ The word nirveda is also ex-
plained in Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu. “One may feel unhappiness and separa-

Text 36] The Ecstatic Manifestations of Lord Caitanya 191
tion, as well as jealousy and lamentation due to not discharging one’s duties.
The despondency that results is called nirveda. When one is captured by this
despondency, thoughts, tears, loss of bodily luster, humility and heavy
breathing result!” Visada is also explained in Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu: “When
one fails to achieve the desired goal of life and repents for all his offenses,
there is a state of regret called visada!’ The symptoms of visada are also ex-
plained. “One hankers to revive his original condition and inquires how to do
so. There are also deep thought, heavy breathing, crying and lamentation as
well as a changing of the bodily color and drying up of the tongue.”

In Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu thirty-three such destructive symptoms are men-
tioned. They are expressed in words, in the eyebrows and in the eyes. These
symptoms are called vyabhicari bhava, destructive ecstasy. If they continue,
they are sometimes called saricari, or continued ecstasy.

before Him. One was His secretary, Svaripa Damodara, and the other was

present, and although He was still talking in the ecstasy of Srimati Radharani,
He immediately began to question whether He was the same $ri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu.

flute and although there is no possibility of My meeting Him, still 1 take
care of My own body. That is the way of lust. In this way, | maintain My

PURPORT
In this connection, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura says that the
lovable Supreme Lord is the supreme shelter. The Lord is the supreme subject,
and the devotees are the object. The coming together of a subject and object
is called alambana. The object hears, and the subject plays the flute. That the
object cannot see the moonlike face of Krsna and has no eagemess to see
Him is the sign of being without dlambana. Externally imagining such a thing
simply satisfies one’s lusty desires, and thus one lives without purpose.

“Love for Lord Krsna is very pure, just like the waters of the Ganges.
That love is an ocean of nectar. That pure attachment to Krsna does not

PURPORT
Unalloyed love of Krsna is just like a big sheet of white cloth. Absence of
attachment is compared to a black spot on that white cloth. Just as the black
spot is prominent, so the absence of love of Godhead is prominent on the
platform of pure love of Godhead.

‘‘Unalloyed love of Krsna is like the ocean of happiness. If someone

In this way, Lord Caitanya used to revel in ecstasy day after day and ex-
hibit these ecstasies before Svariipa and Rimiananda Raya. Externally
there appeared severe tribulation, as if He were suffering from poisonous
effects, but internally He was experiencing bliss. This is characteristic of
transcendental love of Krsna.

TRANSLATION
Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu spoke: ^“ ‘My dear beautiful friend, if one
develops love of Godhead, love of Krsna, the son of Nanda Maharaja, all
the bitter and sweet influences of this love will manifest in one’s heart.
Such love of Godhead acts in two ways. The poisonous effects of love of
Godhead defeat the severe and fresh poison of the serpent. Yet there is
simultaneously transcendental bliss, which pours down and defeats the
pride of nectar and diminishes its value. In other words, love of Krsna is
so powerful that it simultaneously defeats the poisonous effects of a
snake, as well as the happiness derived from pouring nectar on one’s
head. It is perceived as doubly effective, simultaneously poisonous and
nectarean.’ ^“

This verse is spoken by Paurnamasi to Nandimukhi in the Vidagdha-
madhava (2.18) of Srila Ripa Gosvami.

pacifies the body, mind and eyes.

TRANSLATION

Because of the various kinds of ecstasy, contradictory states of mind oc-
curred, and this resulted in a great fight between different types of
ecstasy. Anxiety, impotence, humility, anger and impatience were all like
soldiers fighting, and the madness of love of Godhead was the cause.

PURPORT

In Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu it is stated that when similar ecstasies from
separate causes meet, they are called svardpa-sandhi. When opposing ele-
ments meet, whether they arise from a common cause or different causes,
their conjunction is called bhinna-rdpa-sandhi, the meeting of contradictory
ecstasies. The simultaneous joining of different ecstasies—fear and happi-
ness, regret and happiness—is called meeting (sandhi). The word sabalya
refers to different types of ecstatic symptoms combined together, like pride,
despondency, humility, remembrance, doubt, impatience caused by insult,
fear, disappointment, patience and eagerness. The friction that occurs when
these combine is called $abalya. Similarly, when the desire to see the object is
very prominent, or when one is unable to tolerate any delay in seeing the
desired object, the incapability is called autsukya, or eagerness. If such eager-
ness is present, one’s mouth dries up, and he becomes restless. He also be-
comes full of anxiety, and hard breathing and patience are observed. Similarly,
the lightness of heart caused by strong attachment and strong agitation of
the mind is called impotence (capalya). Failure of judgment, misuse of words,
and obstinate activities devoid of anxiety are observed. Similarly, when one
becomes too angry at the other party, offensive and abominable speech oc-
curs, and this anger is called rosa. When one becomes impatient due to being
scolded or insulted, the resultant state of mind is called amarsa. In this state of
mind, one perspires, acquires a headache, fades in bodily color and ex-

periences anxiety and an urge to search out the remedy. The bearing of a
grudge, aversion and chastisement are all visible symptoms.

The symptoms of madness served as an impetus for remembering
Krsna. The mood of ecstasy awoke love, disdain, defamation by words,
pride, honor and indirect prayer. Thus Sri Krsna was sometimes
blasphemed and sometimes honored.
PURPORT
The word unmada is explained in Bhakti-rasamyta-sindhu as extreme joy,
misfortune and bewilderment in the heart due to separation. Symptoms of
unmada are laughing like a madman, dancing, singing, performing ineffectual
activities, talking nonsense, running, shouting and sometimes working in con-
tradictory ways. The word pranaya is explained thus: When there is a
possibility to receive direct honor, but it is avoided, that love is called pranaya.
Srila Rapa Gosvami, in his Ujjvala-nilamani, explains the word mana thus:
When the lover feels novel sweetness by exchanging hearty loving words but
wishes to hide his feelings by crooked means, mana is experienced.

TRANSLATION
There were different transformations of the body of Lord Caitanya
Mahaprabhu: being stunned, trembling, perspiring, fading away of color,
weeping and choking. In this way His whole body was pervaded by tran-
scendental joy. As a result, sometimes Caitanya Mahaprabhu would laugh,
sometimes cry, sometimes dance and sometimes sing. Sometimes He
would get up and run here and there, and sometimes fall on the ground
and lose consciousness.
PURPORT
In Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu, eight kinds of transcendental change taking
place in the body are described. Stambha, being stunned, refers to the mind's
becoming transcendentally absorbed. In that state, the peaceful mind is
placed on the life air, and different bodily transformations are manifest. These
symptoms are visible in the body of an advanced devotee. When life be-
comes almost inactive, it is called “stunned.” The emotions resulting from this
condition are joy, fear, astonishment, moroseness and anger. In this condition,
the power of speech is lost, and there is no movement in the hands and legs.


--- Page 223 ---
Text 73] The Ecstatic Manifestations of Lord Caitanya 219
Otherwise, being stunned is a mental condition. Many other symptoms are
visible on the entire body in the beginning. These are very subtle, but gradu-
ally they become very apparent. When one cannot speak, naturally one’s ac-
tive senses are arrested, and the knowledge-acquiring senses are rendered in-
operative. Kampa, trembling of the body, is mentioned in Bhakti-rasamrta-
sindhu as a result of a special kind of fear, anger and joy. This is called
vepathu, or kampa. When the body begins to perspire because of joy, fear
and anger combined, this is called sveda. Vaivarnya is described as a change in
the bodily color. It is caused by a combination of moroseness, anger and fear.
When these emotions are experienced, the complexion turns pale, and the
body becomes lean and thin. Asru is explained in Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu as a
combination of joy, anger and moroseness that causes water to flow from the
eyes without effort. When there is joy and there are tears in the eyes, the
temperature of the tears is cold, but when there is anger, the tears are hot. In
both cases, the eyes are restless, the eyeballs are red and there is itching.
These are all symptoms of asru. When there is a combination of moroseness,
astonishment, anger, joy and fear, there is a choking in the voice. This choking
is called gadgada. ऽ Caitanya Mahaprabhu refers to gadgada-ruddhaya gira,
or “afaltering voice!’ In Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu, pulaka is described as joy, en-
couragement and fear. When these combine, the hairs on the body stand on
end, and this bodily state is called pulaka.

TRANSLATION
When Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu was thus unconscious, He happened to
meet the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Consequently He got up and
immediately made a tumultuous sound, very loudly declaring, “Now
Krsna, the great personality, is present!’ In this way, because of Krsna's
sweet qualities, Caitanya Mahaprabhu made different types of mistakes in
His mind. Thus by reading the following verse, He ascertained the pres-
ence of Lord Krsna.

$ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu then would begin to talk like this: “Is Cupid

tree? Is He the same person, personified sweetness, who is the pleasure of
My eyes and mind, who is My life and soul? Has Krsna actually come
before My eyes?”

Mahaprabhu passed His days and nights chanting and hearing with great
pleasure.

Among His associates, Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu enjoyed paternal

loving affection with Paramananda Puri, friendly affection with

Riamananda Riya, unalloyed service from Govinda and others, and
humors of conjugal love with Gadadhara, Jagadinanda and Svariipa
Damodara. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu enjoyed all these four mellows, and
thus He remained obliged to His devotees.
PURPORT
Paramananda Puri is said to have been Uddhava in Vrndavana. His affec-
tions with $i Caitanya Mahaprabhu were on the platform of paternal love.
This was because Paramananda Purl happened to be the Godbrother of the
spiritual master of $f Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Similarly, Rimananda Raya, who
is considered an incarnation of Arjuna and by some an incarnation of
Visakhadevi, enjoyed unalloyed fraternal love with the Lord. Unalloyed per-
sonal service was enjoyed by Govinda and others. In the presence of His
most confidential devotees like Cadadhara Pandita, Jagadananda and Svartpa
Damodara, Caitanya Mahaprabhu enjoyed the ecstatic conditions of Srimati
Radharani in Her conjugal relationship with Krsna. Absorbed in these four
transcendental mellows, ঠা Caitanya Mahaprabhu resided in Jagannatha Puri,
feeling very much obliged to His devotees.

TRANSLATION
Lilasuka [Bilvamangala Thakural was an ordinary human being, yet he
developed many ecstatic symptoms in his body. What, then, is so
astonishing about these symptoms’ being manifest in the body of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead? In the ecstatic mood of conjugal love,
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu was on the highest platform; therefore, all the
exuberant ecstasies were naturally visible in His body.
PURPORT
Lilasuka is Bilvamangala Thakura Cosvami. He was a south Indian, a
brahmana, and his former name was Silhana Misra. When he was a house-
holder, he became attracted to a prostitute named Cintamani, but eventually
he took her advice and became renounced. Thus he wrote one book, Santi-
Sataka, and later, by the mercy of Lord Krsna and the Vaisnavas, he became a
great devotee. Thus he became famous as Bilvamangala Thakura Gosvami.
On that elevated platform, he wrote a book named Krsna-karnamrta, which is
very famous amongst Vaisnavas. Since he exhibited so many ecstatic
symptoms, people used to call him Lilasuka.

TRANSLATION

During His previous pastimes in Vrndavana, Lord Krsna desired to en-
joy the three different types of ecstasy, but despite great endeavor, He
could not taste them. Such ecstasies are the monopoly of Srimati
Radharani. Therefore, in order to taste them, Sri Krsna accepted the posi-
tion of $rimati Radharani in the form of $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.

TRANSLATION

By personally tasting the mellows of love of Godhead, Caitanya
Mahaprabhu taught His direct disciples the process. Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu is the most munificent incarnation of the touchstone of love
of God. He does not consider whether one is a proper or improper re-
cipient, but gives His treasure to anyone and everyone. Thus He is the
most munificent.

PURPORT

Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s capital is the touchstone of love of Godhead,

and consequently He is a great owner of that transcendental treasure. After


--- Page 231 ---
Text 82] The Ecstatic Manifestations of Lord Caitanya 227
making unlimited amounts of gold, the touchstone remains the same.
Similarly, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, although distributing love of Godhead
unlimitedly, still remained the supreme owner of this transcendental opu-
lence. His devotees, who learned it from Him, also had to distribute it munifi-
cently all over the world. This Krsna consciousness movement, following in
the footsteps of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and His confidential devotees, is
also trying to distribute love of Godhead all over the world through the
chanting of the holy names of the Lord—Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna
Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.

TRANSLATION
No one, not even Lord Brahma, can ascertain or even taste a drop of this
confidential ocean of ecstasy, but $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, out of His
causeless mercy, has distributed this love of Godhead all over the world.
Thus there cannot be any incarnation more munificent than Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu. There is no greater donor. Who can describe His transcen-
dental qualities?

TRANSLATION
Such topics are not to be discussed freely because if they are, no one
will understand them. Such are the wonderful pastimes of Sri Caitanya
Mahiprabhu. Unto one who is able to understand, S$ri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu has shown mercy by giving him the association of the ser-
vant of His own servant.
PURPORT
An ordinary person cannot understand the transcendental ecstasies in the
mode of Srimati Radharani. Unfit persons who utilize them are perverted into
the sahajiya, baula and other sampradayas. Thus the teachings are perverted.
Even learned scholars in the academic field cannot understand the transcen-
dental bliss and ecstasy exhibited by 67 Caitanya Mahaprabhu and His pure
devotees. One must be fit to understand the purport of $ri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu's activities.

The pastimes of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu are the topmost of jewels.

who has explained them to Raghunitha dasa Gosvami, who has repeated
them to me. Whatever little 1 have heard from Raghunatha dasa Gosvami |
have described in this book, which is presented to all devotees.
PURPORT
All the activities of जा Caitanya Mahaprabhu were noted by His personal
secretary Svaripa Damodara and repeated to Raghunatha dasa Gosvami,
who memorized them. Whatever Krsnadasa Kavirdgja Gosvami heard is
recorded in Sr Caitanya-caritamrta. This is called the parampara system, from
6 Caitanya Mahaprabhu to Svartipa Damodara to Raghunatha dasa Gosvami
to Kavirdja Gosvami. Krsnadasa Kavirdja Gosvami has distributed this informa-
tion in his book Caitanya-caritamrta. In other words, Caitanya-caritamrta is
the essence of the instruction given through the parampara system of the dis-
ciplic succession stemming from $f Caitanya Mahaprabhu.

PURPORT

Srila Kaviraja Gosvami and one who follows in his footsteps do not have to
cater to the public. Their business is simply to satisfy the previous acaryas and
describe the pastimes of the Lord. One who is able to understand can relish
this exalted transcendental literature, which is actually not meant for ordinary
persons like scholars and literary men. Generally, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s
pastimes recorded in Caitanya-caritaimrta are studied in universities and
scholastic circles from a literary and historical point of view, but actually
Caitanya-caritamrta is not a subject matter for research workers or literary
scholars. It is simply meant for those devotees who have dedicated their lives
to the service of $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.

someone's likes and dislikes, | cannot possibly write the simple truth.
PURPORT
The simplest thing for human beings is to follow their predecessors. Judg-
ment according to mundane senses is not a very easy process. Whatever is
awakened by attachment to one’s predecessor is the way of devotional ser-
vice as indicated by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. The author says, however, that
he cannot consider the opinions of those who become attracted or repelled
by such things, because one cannot write impartially in that way. In other
words, the author is stating that he did not inject personal opinion in
Caitanya-caritamrta. He has simply described his spontaneous understanding
from superiors. If he had been carried away by someone's likes and dislikes,
he could not have written of such a sublime subject matter in such an easy


--- Page 236 ---
232 $ri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 2
way. The actual facts are understandable to real devotees. When these facts
are recorded, they are very congenial to the devotees, but one who is not a
devotee cannot understand. Such is the subject matter for realization. Mun-
dane scholarship and its concomitant attachments and detachments cannot
arouse spontaneous love of Godhead. Such love cannot be described by a
mundane scholar.

If one does not understand in the beginning but continues to hear again

love for Krsna. Gradually one will come to understand the loving affairs

In reply to those critics who say that Sri Caitanya-caritamrta is full of
Sanskrit verses, it can be said that Srimad-Bhagavatam is also full of
Sanskrit verses, as are the commentaries on Srimad-Bhagavatam. None-
theless, Srimad-Bhagavatam can be understood by everyone, as well as by
advanced devotees who study the Sanskrit commentaries. Why, then, will
people not understand Caitanya-caritimrta? There are only a few Sanskrit
verses, and these have been explained in the Bengali vernacular. What is
the difficulty in understanding?

PURPORT

According to Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura, there are three kinds
of devotees, known as bhajana-vijiia (experts in devotional service), bhajana-
sila (devotees engaged in devotional service), and krsna-name diksita krsna-
namakarf (initiated devotees engaged in chanting). The author of Caitanya-
caritamrta begs the mercy of all these devotees and asks them to be pleased
with him. He says, “Let the neophyte devotees—the devotees who are very
expert in arguing though they have no sense of advanced devotional service,
who think themselves very advanced because they imitate some smarta-
brahmana— let such devotees not be displeased with me, thinking that । have
committed errors in this regard. | beg their pardon with great humility, but |

CHAPTER 3
Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s
Stay at the House of Advaita Acarya
In his Amrta-pravaha-bhasya, Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura gives the following
summary study of the Third Chapter. After accepting the sannyasa order at
Katwa, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu traveled continuously for three days in the
Radha-desa and, by the trick of Nityananda Prabhu, eventually came to the
western side of Santipura. $i Caitanya Mahaprabhu was induced to believe
that the River Ganges was the Yamuna. When He was worshiping the sacred
river, Advaita Prabhu appeared with a boat. Advaita Prabhu asked Him to
take His bath in the Ganges and took Him to His own house. There, at the
house of Advaita Prabhu, all the Navadvipa devotees, along with mother
Sacidevi, came to see ऽग Caitanya Mahaprabhu. This house was located at
Santipura. Mother Sacidevi cooked for Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and Nitya-
nanda Prabhu, and at that time there were many joking exchanges between
Advaita Prabhu and Nityananda Prabhu. In the evening there was a mass
sankirtana at the house of Advaita Prabhu, and mother $Sacidevi gave ऽ
Caitanya Mahaprabhu permission to leave. She requested Him to make Jagan-
natha Puri, Nilacala, His headquarters. जा Caitanya Mahaprabhu granted His
mother’s request and, followed by Nityananda, Mukunda, Jagadananda and
Damodara, left Santipura. Bidding farewell to mother Sacidevi, they all pro-
ceeded toward Jagannatha Puri, following the path of Chatrabhoga.

PURPORT
The word Radha-de$a comes from the word rastra, or “state!” From rastra
the perverted word ragha has come. The part of Bengal on the western side
of the Ganges is known as Radha-de$a. Another name is Paundra-de$a. The
word paundra is a perverted form of the word pendo. It appears that the
capital of Rastra-desa was situated in that part of Bengal.

Text 6] Lord Caitanya at the House of Advaita Acirya 243
fixed in firm devotion to the Lord, Paramatma, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead!’

PURPORT

In connection with this verse, which is a quotation from Srimad-
Bhagavatam (11.23.58), Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura says that of
the sixty-four items required for rendering devotional service, acceptance of
the symbolic marks of sannydsa is a regulative principle. If one accepts the
sannydasa order, his main business is to devote his life completely to the ser-
vice of Mukunda, Krsna. If one does not completely devote his mind and
body to the service of the Lord, he does not actually become a sannyasi. It is
not simply a matter of changing dress. In Bhagavad-gita (6.1) it is also stated,
anasritah karma-phalarn karyar karma karoti yah/sa sannydsi ca yogi ca: one
who works devotedly for the satisfaction of Krsna is a sannydasi. The dress is
not sannydsa, but the attitude of service to Krsna is.

The word paratma-nistha means being a devotee of Lord Krsna. Paratma,
the Supreme Person, is Krsna. I$varah paramah krsnah sac-cid-dnanda-
vigrahah. Those who are completely dedicated to the lotus feet of Krsna in
service are actually sannydsis. As a matter of formality, the devotee accepts
the sannydsa dress as previous dcdryas did. He also accepts the three dandas.
Later Visnusvami considered that accepting the dress of a tri-dangdi was parat-
ma-nistha. Therefore sincere devotees add another danda, the jiva-danda, to
the three existing dandas. The Vaisnava sannyasi is known as a tridandi-san-
nyasi. The Mayavadi sannydsi accepts only one 03003, not understanding the
purpose of tri-danga. Later, many persons in the community of Siva Svami
gave up the atma-nistha (devotional service) of the Lord and followed the
path of Sankaricarya. Instead of accepting 108 names, those in the Siva
Svami-sampradaya follow the path of Safkaracarya and accept the ten names
of sannyasa. Although ऽं Caitanya Mahaprabhu accepted the then-existing
order of sannydsa (namely eka-danda), He still recited a verse from Srimad-
Bhagavatam about the tridanga-sannyasa accepted by the brahmana of
Avantipura. Indirectly He declared that within that eka-danda, one danda,
four dandas existed as one. Accepting ekadanda-sannyasa without paratma-
nistha (devotional service to Lord Krsna) is not acceptable to $ri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu. In addition, according to the exact regulative principles, one
should add the jiva-danda to the tri-danda. These four dandas, bound
together as one, are symbolic of unalloyed devotional service to the Lord. Be-
cause the ekadandli-sannyasis of the Mayavada school are not devoted to the
service of Krsna, they try to merge into the Brahman effulgence, which is a
marginal position between material and spiritual existence. They accept this


--- Page 248 ---
244 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lili, Ch. 3
impersonal position as liberation. Mayavadi sannyasis, not knowing that Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu was a tri-dandi, think of Caitanya Mahaprabhu as an
ekadandi-sannyasi. This is due to their vivarta, bewilderment. In Srimad-
Bhagavatam there is no such thing as an ekadandi-sannyasi; indeed, the tri-
dandi-sannyasi is accepted as the symbolic representation of the sannyasa
order. By citing this verse from Srimad-Bhagavatam, হয Caitanya Mahaprabhu
accepted the sannyasa order recommended in Srimad-Bhagavatam. The
Mayavadi sannyasis, who are enamored of the external energy of the Lord,
cannot understand the mind of $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.

To date, all the devotees of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, following in His
footsteps, accept the sannyasa order and keep the sacred thread and tuft of
unshaved hair. The ekadandi-sannyasis of the Mayavadi school give up the
sacred thread and do not keep any tuft of hair. Therefore they are unable to
understand the purport of tridanda-sannyasa, and as such they are not in-
clined to dedicate their lives to the service of Mukunda. They simply think of
merging into the existence of Brahman because of their disgust with material
existence. The acaryas who advocate the daiva-varnasrama (the social order
of catur-varnyam mentioned in Bhagavad-gita) do not accept the proposition
of asura-varnasrama, which maintains that the social order of varna is indi-
cated by birth.

The most intimate devotee of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, namely
Gadadhara Pandita, accepted tridanda-sannyasa and also accepted Madhava
Upadhyaya as his tridandi-sannyasi disciple. It is said that from this
Madhavacarya the sampradaya known in western India as the Vallabhacarya-
sampradaya has begun. Srila Gopala Bhatta Bose, who is known as a smrty-
acarya in the Gaudiya-Vaisnava-sampradaya, later accepted the tridanda-san-
nyasa order from Tridandipada Prabodhananda Sarasvati. Although accept-
ance of tridanda-sannydsa is not distinctly mentioned in the Gaudiya
Vaisnava literature, the first verse of Srila Rapa Gosvami's Upadesamrta advo-
cates that one should accept the tridanda-sannyasa order by controlling the
six forces:

৮3০০ vegam manasah krodha-vegam
jihva-vegam udaropastha-vegam
etan vegan yo visaheta dhirah
sarvam apimarn prthiviri sa sisyat
“One who can control the forces of speech, mind, anger, belly, tongue and
genitals is known as a gosvami and is competent to accept disciples all over
the world” The followers of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu never accepted the
Mayavada order of sannyasa, and for this they cannot be blamed. जा Caitanya

Text 8] Lord Caitanya at the House of Advaita Aciarya 245
Mahaprabhu accepted Sridhara Svami, who was a tridandi-sannyasi, but the
Mayavadi sannyasis, not understanding Sridhara Svami, sometimes think that
Sridhara Svami belonged to the Mayavada ekadanda-sannyasa community.
Actually this was not the case.

service of Mukunda. By serving Mukunda, one can actually be liberated
from the bondage of material existence.

246 5 Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 3
PURPORT
In this connection, $rila Bhaktivinoda Thakura says that $ri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu accepted the sannyasa order and recommended the determina-
tion of the Avantipura bhiksu to engage in the service of Mukunda. He ac-
cepted the brahmana’s version due to his determination to serve Mukunda.
The sannyasi dress is actually an attraction for material formality. ঠা Caitanya
Mahaprabhu did not like such formality, but He wanted the essence of it—
service to Mukunda. Such determination in any condition is pardtma-nistha.
That is required. The conclusion is that the sannydsa order depends not on
the dress but the determination to serve Mukunda.

prathame paka kariyachena acaryani

SYNONYMS
prathame —first; paka—cooking; kariydchena—performed; acaryani—the
wife of Advaita Acarya; visnu-samarpana—offering to Lord Visnu; kaila—did;
acarya—Advaita Acarya; dpani—Himself.
TRANSLATION
All the eatables were first cooked by the wife of Advaita Aciarya. Then
Srila Advaita Acarya personally offered everything to Lord Visnu.
PURPORT
This is the ideal householder’s life. The husband and wife live together, and
the husband works very hard to secure paraphernalia for worshiping Lord
Visnu. The wife at home cooks a variety of foodstuffs for Lord Visnu, and the
husband offers it to the Deity. After that, arati is performed, and the prasada is
distributed amongst family members and guests. According to the Vedic prin-
ciples, there must always be a guest in the householder’s house. In my child-
hood | have actually seen my father receive not less than four guests every
day, and in those days my father’s income was not very great. Nonetheless,
there was no difficulty in offering prasada to at least four guests every day.
According to Vedic principles, a householder, before taking lunch, should go


--- Page 268 ---
262 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 3
outside and shout very loudly to see if there is anyone without food. In this
way he invites people to take prasida. If someone comes, the householder
offers him prasada, and if there is not much left, he should offer his own por-
tion to the guest. If no one responds to his call, the householder can accept
his own lunch. Thus the householder’s life is also a kind of austerity. Because
of this, the householder’s life is called the grhastha-asrama. Although a person
may live with his wife and children happily in Krsna consciousness, he also
observes the regulative principles followed in any temple. If there is no Krsna
consciousness, the householder's abode is called a grhamedhi’s house.
Householders in Krsna consciousness are actually grhasthas—that is, those
living in the d§rama with their families and children. भं Advaita Prabhu was an
ideal grhastha, and His house was the ideal grhastha-asrama.

SYNONYMS

tina thani—in three places; bhoga—cooked foodstuffs; badaila—
distributed; sama—equal; kari’—making; krspnera bhoga—the foodstuff
offered to Krsna; baddila—was arranged; dhatu-patra upari—on a metal
plate.

TRANSLATION

All the prepared foods were divided into three equal parts. One part

was arranged on a metal plate for offering to Lord Krsna.
PURPORT

The word badaila, meaning “increased,” is very significant in this verse. It is
a sophisticated word used by the grhasthas in Bengal. Whenever food is pre-
pared and we take away a portion, the food is actually decreased. But here it
is the system to say badaila, or “increased!” If food is prepared for Krsna and
offered to Him and the Vaisnavas, the stock is increased, never decreased.

Text 64] Lord Caitanya at the House of Advaita Acarya 273
PURPORT
Although the Hindus and Muslims lived together in a very friendly manner,
still there were distinctions between them. The Mohammedans were con-
sidered yavanas, or low-born, and whenever a Mohammedan was invited, he
would be fed outside of the house. Although personally called by Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu and Nityananda Prabhu to take prasada with Them,
still, out of great humility, Haridasa Thakura submitted, “I shall take the
prasada outside of the house!” Although Haridasa Thakura was an exalted
Vaisnava accepted by Advaita Acarya, Nityananda Prabhu and Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu, nonetheless, in order not to disturb social tranquility, he humbly
kept himself in the position of a Mohammedan, outside the jurisdiction of the
Hindu community. Therefore he proposed to take prasada outside the house.
Although he was in an exalted position and equal to other great Vaisnavas,
he considered himself a papistha, a most sinful man, and adhama, the lowest
among men. Although a Vaisnava may be very much advanced spiritually, he
keeps himself externally humble and submissive.

Text 68] Lord Caitanya at the House of Advaita Acarya 275
PURPORT
Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura states that one of these servings
was offered in a metal dish and was meant for Krsna, whereas the other two
were placed on big banana leaves. The offering on the metal plate was per-
sonally offered by Advaita Acdrya to Krsna. The other two servings, on
banana leaves, were to be accepted by जा Caitanya Mahaprabhu and Lord
Nityananda. That was Advaita Acarya’s intention, but He did not disclose this
to Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Thus when Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu saw the
foodstuff offered in three places, He thought that all of it was meant for
Krsna.

such a variety of foodstuff. If he does, how can he control his senses?’


--- Page 285 ---
Text 71] Lord Caitanya at the House of Advaita Aciarya 277
PURPORT

The word upakarana indicates a variety of foodstuffs, such as dahl, vegeta-
bles and other varieties of possible dishes that one can eat very nicely with
rice. It is not proper, however, for a sannyasi to eat such palatable dishes. If he
did so, he would not be able to control his senses. ऽ Caitanya Mahaprabhu
did not encourage sannyasis to eat very palatable dishes, for the whole
Vaisnava cult is vairagya-vidya, as renounced as possible. Caitanya
Mahaprabhu also advised Raghunatha dasa Cosvami not to eat very palatable
dishes, wear very nice garments or talk on mundane subjects. These things
are all prohibited for those in the renounced order. A devotee does not ac-
cept anything to eat that is not first offered to Krsna. All the rich foodstuffs
offered to Krsna are given to the grhasthas, the householders. There are many
nice things offered to Krsna—garlands, bedsteads, nice ornaments, nice food,
and even nicely prepared pan, betel nuts—but a humble Vaisnava, thinking
his body material and nasty, does not accept such preparations for himself.
He thinks that by accepting such things he will offend the lotus feet of the
Lord. Those who are sahajiyas cannot understand what $ri Caitanya
14317313070 meant when He asked Advaita Acarya to bring two separate
leaves and give a small quantity of the prasadato Him.

already been served, Advaita Acarya said, ‘‘Please give up Your conceal-
ment. | know what You are, and | know the confidential meaning of Your
accepting the sannyasa order.”

Advaita Acirya said: “You are a reject paramaharnsa, and You have ac-

PURPORT
There is always a difference of opinion between a smarta-brahmana and a
Vaisnava gosvami. There are even smarta opinions and Vaisnava gosvami
opinions available in astrological and astronomical calculations. By calling Ni-
tyananda Prabhu a bhrasta avadhata (a rejected paramaharnsa), Advaita
Acarya Prabhu in a sense accepted Nityananda Prabhu as a paramaharisa. In


--- Page 293 ---
Text 86] Lord Caitanya at the House of Advaita Acarya 285
other words, Nityananda Prabhu had nothing to do with the rules governing
smarta-brahmanas. Thus under pretense of condemning Him, Advaita Acarya
was actually praising Him. In the avadhdta stage, the paramahamsa stage,
which is the supermost stage, one may appear to be visayi, on the platform
of sense gratification, but in actuality he has nothing to do with sense grati-
fication. At that stage, a person sometimes accepts the symptoms and dress
of a sannyasi and sometimes does not. Sometimes he dresses like a house-
holder. We should know, however, that these are all joking words between
Advaita Acarya and Nityananda Prabhu. They are not to be taken as insults.
In Khadadaha, sometimes people misunderstood Nityananda Prabhu to
belong to the $akta-sampraddya, whose philosophy is antah saktah bahih
Saivah sabhayam vaisnavo matah. According to the $akta-sampradaya, a per-
son called kaulavadhata thinks materially while externally appearing to be a
great devotee of Lord Siva. When such a person is in an assembly of
Vaisnavas, he appears like a Vaisnava. Actually Nityananda Prabhu did not
belong to such a community. Nityananda Prabhu was always a brahmacari of
a sannyasi of the vaidika order. Actually He was a paramahamsa. Sometimes
He is accepted to be a disciple of Laksmipati Tirtha. If He is so accepted,
Nityananda Prabhu belonged to the Madhva-sampradaya. He did not belong
to the tantrika-sampradaya of Bengal.

SYNONYMS
avadhatera jhutha—the remnants of the food of the avadhata; lagila—
touched; mora—My; arige—on the body; parama pavitra—perfectly
purified; more—Me; kaila—made; ei—this; dharige—behavior.
TRANSLATION
When the rice thrown by Nityananda Prabhu touched His body, Advaita
Acarya thought Himself purified by the touch of remnants thrown by
paramaharisa Nityananda. Therefore He began dancing.
PURPORT
The word avadhdata refers to one above all rules and regulations. Some-
times, not observing all the rules and regulations of a sannyasi, Nityananda
Prabhu exhibited the behavior of a mad avadhata. He threw the remnants of
food on the ground, and some of these remnants touched the body of
Advaita Acarya. Advaita Acarya accepted this happily because He presented
Himself as a member of the community of smarta-brahmanas. By touching the
remnants of food thrown by Nityananda Prabhu, Advaita Acarya immediately
felt Himself purified of all smarta contamination. The remnants of food left by
a pure Vaisnava are called maha-maha-prasada. This is completely spiritual
and is identified with Lord Visnu. Such remnants are not ordinary. The spiritual
master is to be considered on the stage of paramaharisa and beyond the
jurisdiction of the varpasrama institution. The remnants of food left by the
spiritual master and similar paramaharisas or pure Vaisnavas are purifying.
When an ordinary person touches such prasada, his mind is purified, and his
mind is raised to the status of a pure brahmana. The behavior and statements


--- Page 299 ---
Text 98] Lord Caitanya at the House of Advaita Acarya 291
of Advaita Acarya are meant for the understanding of ordinary people who
are unaware of the strength of spiritual values, not knowing the potency of
foodstuffs left by the bona fide spiritual master and pure Vaisnavas.

SYNONYMS
tore—You; nimantrana—invitation; kari’—making; painu—I have gotten in
return; tira—of that; phala—the result; tora—Your; jati-kula nahi—there is
no indication of Your caste and family; sahaje—by nature; pagala—You are a
madman.
TRANSLATION
Advaita Acarya jokingly said: “My dear Nityananda, | invited You, and
indeed | have received the results. You have no fixed caste or dynasty. By
nature You are a madman.
PURPORT
The words sahaje pagala (“by nature a madman”) indicate that Nityananda
Prabhu was transcendentally situated on the paramaharisa stage. Because He
always remembered Radha-Krsna and Their service, this was transcendental
madness. ७ Advaita Acarya was pointing out this fact.

SYNONYMS
apanara sama—like You; more—Me; karibara tare—for making; jhutha—
remnants of foodstuffs; dile—You have given; vipra bali’—considering as a
brahmana; bhaya—fear; na karile—You did not do.


--- Page 300 ---
292 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 3
TRANSLATION
“To make Me a madman like Yourself, You have thrown the remnants of
Your food at Me. You did not even fear the fact that | am a brahmana’’
PURPORT
The words dpanara sama indicate that Advaita Acarya considered Himself
to belong to the smarta-brahmanas, and He considered Nityananda Prabhu to
be on the transcendental stage with pure Vaisnavas. Lord Nityananda gave
Advaita Acarya His remnants to situate Him on the same platform and make
Him a pure unalloyed Vaisnava or paramaharisa. Advaita Acarya's statement
indicates that a paramahamsa Vaisnava is transcendentally situated. A pure
Vaisnava is not subject to the rules and regulations of the smarta-brahmanas.
That was the reason for Advaita Acarya's stating, pandra sama more karibara
tare: “To raise Me to Your own standard!’ A pure Vaisnava ora person on the
paramahansa stage accepts the remnants of food (maha-prasada) as spiritual.
He does not consider it to be material or sense gratificatory. He accepts
maha-prasada not as ordinary dahl and rice but as spiritual substance. To say
nothing of the remnants of food left by a pure Vaisnava, prasada is never
polluted even if it is touched by the mouth of a candala. Indeed, it retains its
spiritual value. Therefore by eating or touching such maha-prasida, a
brahmana is not degraded. There is no question of being polluted by touching
the remnants of such food. Actually, by eating such maha-prasada, one is
freed from all the contaminations of the material condition. That is the verdict
of the sastra.

prasdda of Lord Krsna; ihdke—unto it; jhuthd—remnants of foodstuff;
kahile—if You say; tumi—You; kaile—have made; aparadha—offense.


--- Page 301 ---
Text 101] Lord Caitanya at the House of Advaita Acirya 293
TRANSLATION
Nityananda Prabhu replied: “These are the remnants of food left by
Lord Krsna. If You take them to be ordinary remnants, You have commit-
ted an offense.”
PURPORT
In the Brhad-visnu Purana it is stated that one who considers maha-prasada
to be equal to ordinary rice and dahl certainly commits a great offense. Ordi-
nary edibles are touchable and untouchable, but there are no such dualistic
considerations where prasada is concerned. Prasada is transcendental, and
there are no transformations or contaminations, just as there are no con-
taminations or transformations in the body of Lord Visnu Himself. Thus even
if one is a brahmana he is certain to be attacked by leprosy and bereft of all
family members if he makes such dualistic considerations. Such an offender
goes to hell, never to return. This is the injunction of the Brhad-visnu Purana.

nullified.”

Vaisnava. “You have already made Me dance according to your vow,’
Caitanya Mahaprabhu said. “Now please stop it. You can go and take Your
lunch with Mukunda and Haridasa.”

PURPORT
This is a song composed by Vidyapati. Sometimes the word madhava is
misunderstood to refer to Madhavendra Purl. Advaita Acarya was a disciple
of Madhavendra Puri, and consequently some people think that He was refer-
ring to Madhavendra Puri by using the word madhava. But actually this is not
the fact. This song was composed to commemorate the separation of Krsna
from Radharani during Krsna’s absence in Mathura. This song was supposed
to be sung by अवधं Radharani when Krsna returned. It is technically called
Mathura-viraha.

Devastation is described in Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu as a combination of
happiness and distress that becomes conspicuous by an absence of any sense
of them. In this condition, a devotee falls to the ground, and the subsequent
symptoms in the body ensue. These symptoms are mentioned above, and
when they become prominent in the body, a state called pralaya (devasta-
tion) is manifest.

Cakravarti, used to worship Lord Visnu even before her marriage. As stated in
Bhagavad-gita (6:41):

Text 168] [010 Caitanya at the House of Advaita Acirya 325
“The unsuccessful yogi, after many, many years of enjoyment on the planets
of the pious living entities, is born into a family of righteous people, or into a
family of rich aristocracy!” Mother 530, a nitya-siddha living entity, is an incar-
nation of mother Yasoda. She appeared in the house of Nilambara Cakravarti
and was everlastingly engaged in the service of Lord Visnu. Later she directly
had as her child Lord Visnu, 51 Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and she served Him
from the day of His appearance. This is the position of nitya-siddha associ-
ates. Sri Narottama dasa Thakura therefore sings: gaurangera sangi-gane
nitya-siddha kari mane. Every devotee should know that all the associates of
6 Caitanya Mahaprabhu—His family members, friends and other associ-
ates—were all nitya-siddhas. A nitya-siddha never forgets the service of the
Lord. He is always engaged, even from childhood, in worshiping the Supreme
Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION
Since Advaita Aciarya was giving alms and food to Lord Caitanya
Mahaprabhu, the other devotees, headed by Srivasa Thakura, also desired
to give Him alms and invite Him for lunch.
PURPORT
It is the duty of all grhasthas to invite a sannyasi to their homes if he hap-
pens to be in the neighborhood or village. This very system is still current in
India. If a sannyasi is in the neighborhood of a village, he is invited by all
householders, one after another. As long as a sannyasi remains in the village,
he enlightens the inhabitants in spiritual understanding. In other words, a san-

nyasi has no housing or food problems even when he travels extensively.
Even though Advaita Acarya was supplying Caitanya Mahaprabhu with
prasada, the other devotees from Navadvipa and Santipura also desired to
offer Him prasada.

--- Page 340 ---
332 Sri Caitanya-caritimrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 3
PURPORT

It is a great happiness for a mother if her son does not leave home to search
out Krsna but remains with her. At the same time, if a son does not search
after Krsna but simply remains at home, he is certainly blamed by experienced
saintly persons. Such blame certainly causes great unhappiness for a mother.
If a real mother wants her son to progress spiritually, she had better allow him
to go out searching for Krsna. The mother naturally desires the welfare of the
son. If a mother does not allow her son to search for Krsna, she is called ma,
which indicates maya. By allowing her son to go as a sannyasi and search for
Krsna, Sacimata instructs all mothers of the world. She indicates that all sons
should become real devotees of Krsna and should not stay at home under the
care of an affectionate mother. This is supported by Srimad-Bhagavatam
(5.5.18):

gurur na sa syat sva-jano na sa syat
pita na sa syaj janani na sa syat
daivari na tat syan na (2215 ca sa syan
na mocayed yah samupeta-mtyum

“No one should become a spiritual master—nor a relative, father, mother,
worshipable Deity or husband —if he cannot help a person escape the immi-
nent path of death!” Every living entity is wandering within the universe, sub-
jected to the law of karma and transmigrating from one body to another and
from one planet to another. Therefore the whole Vedic process is meant to
save the wandering living entities from the clutches of maya—birth, death,
disease and old age. This means stopping the cycle of birth and death. This
cycle can be stopped only if one worships Krsna. As the Lord says in
Bhagavad-gita (4.9):

janma karma ca me divyam

evar yo vetti tattvatah
tyaktva deham punar janma
naiti mam eti so ‘rjuna

“One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities
does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world,
but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.

To stop the cycle of birth and death, one has to understand Krsna as He is.
Simply by knowing Krsna, one can stop the process of rebirth into this mate-
rial world. By acting in Krsna consciousness, one can return to Godhead. The
highest perfection of life is for a father, mother, spiritual master, husband or


--- Page 341 ---
Text 183] Lord Caitanya at the House of Advaita Acarya 333
any other family member to help others return home, back to Godhead. That
is the most preferred welfare activity for the benefit of relatives. Therefore,
Sacimata, although the mother of Nimai Pandita, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu,
considered all the facts and decided to allow her son to go out and search for
Krsna. At the same time, she made some arrangements in order that she
might get news of all the activities of जा Caitanya Mahaprabhu.

Text 191] Lord Caitanya at the House of Advaita Acarya 337
ghare yana kara sada krsna-sankirtana
krsna-nama, krsna-katha, (1503 aradhana
SYNONYMS
ghare yana—returning home; kara—kindly do; sada—always; krsna-
sarikirtana—chanting of the holy name of the Lord; krspa-nama—the holy
name of the Lord; krspa-katha—discussion of Krsna's pastimes; krsna—of
Lord Krsna; aradhana—worshiping.
TRANSLATION
Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu requested them all to return home and
begin chanting the holy name congregationally. He also requested them
to worship Krsna, chant His holy name and discuss His holy pastimes.
PURPORT
The cult of $f Caitanya Mahaprabhu, the Hare Krsna movement, is very
nicely explained by Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu authoritatively. It is not that
everyone has to take sannyasa like ऽं Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Everyone can
execute the cult of Krsna consciousness at home, as ordered by the Lord.
Everyone can congregationally chant the holy name of Krsna, the Hare Krsna
maha-mantra. One can also discuss the subject matter of Bhagavad-gita and
Srimad-Bhagavatam and install Deities of Radha-Krsna or Gaura-Nitai or both
and worship them very carefully in one’s own home. It is not that we have to
open different centers all over the world. Whoever cares for the Krsna con-
sciousness movement can install Deities at home and, under superior guid-
ance, worship the Deity regularly, chanting the maha-mantra and discussing
Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam. We are actually teaching in our
classes how to go about this. One who feels that he 15 not yet ready to live in
a temple or undergo strict regulative principles in the temple —especially
householders who live with wife and children —can start a center at home by
installing the Deity, worshiping the Lord morning and evening, chanting Hare
Krsna and discussing Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam. Anyone can do
this at home without difficulty, and 511 Caitanya Mahaprabhu requested all
the devotees present there to do so.

Haridasa Thakura said: ‘You are going to Jagannatha Puri, and that is all

Puri’

PURPORT

Although 51712 Haridasa Thakura was bom in a Mohameddan family, he was
accepted as a properly initiated brahmana. As such, he had every right to
enter the temple of Jagannatha Puri, but because there were some rules and
regulations stipulating that only brahmanas, ksatriyas, vaiSyas and sadras
(members of the varnasrama-dharma system) could enter, Haridasa Thakura,
out of his great humility, did not want to violate these existing rules. He
therefore said that he did not have the strength to enter into the temple, and
he pointed out that if Lord $i Caitanya Mahaprabhu lived within the temple,
there would be no way for Haridasa Thakura to see Him. Later, when Haridasa


--- Page 348 ---
340 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 3
Thakura went to Jagannatha Puri, he lived outside the temple on the beach
by the sea. A monastery has now been erected there, known as Siddha-
bakula Matha. People go there to see the tomb of Haridasa Thakura.

TRANSLATION

In this way all the opulences of Advaita Acarya— His faith, devotion,
home, riches and everything else—were successfully utilized in the wor-
ship of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu.

PURPORT

Advaita Acarya set an ideal example for all householder devotees in His
receiving of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu and His devotees and in His execu-
tion of a daily festival at His home. If one has the proper means and wealth,
he should occasionally invite the devotees of Lord Caitanya, who are
engaged in preaching all over the world, and hold a festival at home simply
by distributing prasada and talking about Krsna during the day and holding
congregational chanting for at least three hours in the evening. This pro-
cedure must be adopted in all centers of the Krsna consciousness movement.
Thus they will daily perform sarikirtana-yajia. In Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.5.32)
the daily performance of sankirtana-yajfia is recommended for this age
(yajnaih sarikirtana-prayair yajanti hi sumedhasah). One should worship Lord
Caitanya Mahaprabhu and His four associates, the Pafica-tattva, by distribut-
ing prasida and holding congregational chanting. Indeed, that yajia or
sacrifice is most recommended in this age of Kali. In this age, other 1/2/725 are
not possible to perform, but this yajia can be performed everywhere and
anywhere without difficulty.

TRANSLATION
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu was unaffected. He left swiftly, and Advaita
Acarya followed Him weeping.
PURPORT
As Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura explains, the word nirapeksa
means not being affected by anything material and remaining fixed in the ser-
vice of the Lord. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu did not very much care for the
roaring tumult and cry at the house of Advaita Acarya, which He heard when
starting for Jagannatha Puri. Worldly moralists may criticize $ri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu for being very cruel, but the Lord did not care for such criticism.
As the world teacher of this Krsna consciousness movement, He actually
showed that a person seriously engaged in Krsna consciousness should not
be affected by worldly affection. The best course is to engage in rendering
service to the Lord and to become callous to material objectives. Externally
everyone is attached to material things, but if one becomes entangled in such
things, he cannot make progress in Krsna consciousness. Therefore those who
are engaged in Krsna consciousness should not care for the so-called morality
of the material world if that morality opposes the service of the Lord. As Lord
Caitanya Mahaprabhu has personally shown, one cannot properly execute
Krsna consciousness without being neutral.

The Lord, with the other four persons, went along the banks of the

PURPORT
In the southern section of the eastern railway, in the district of twenty-four
pargands, is a station named Magrahata. If one goes to the southeastern side
of that station for some fourteen miles, there is a place called Jayanagara.
About six miles south of this Jayanagara station is a village named
Chatrabhoga. Sometimes this village is called Khadi. In this village is a Deity of
Lord Siva known as Vaijurkanatha. A festival takes place there every year dur-
ing the months of March and April. The festival is known as Nanda-mela. At
the present moment the Ganges does not flow there. On the same railway
line is another station, known as Baruipura, and near this station is another
place, called Atisara. Formerly this village was also situated on the banks of


--- Page 359 ---
Text 218] Lord Caitanya at the House of Advaita Acarya 351
the Ganges. One can go from this village to Panihati and from there to
Varaha-nagara, north of Calcutta. In those days the Ganges flowed to the
south of Calcutta through Kali-ghata, which is still known as adi-garnga. From
Baruipura, the Ganges branched out and flowed through Diamond Harbor
near the Mathurapura police station. It is to be noted that Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu passed through all these places on His way to Jagannatha Puri.

Varaha-grama and Chatrabhoga. He then reached the Orissa province, where
he passed through Prayaga-ghata, Suvarnarekha, Remuna, Yajapura, Vaitarani,
Dasasvamedha-ghata, Kataka, Mahanadi, Bhuvane$vara (where there is a big
lake known as Bindu-sarovara), Kamalapura and Atharanala. In this way, pass-
ing through all these and other places, He reached Jagannatha Puri.
