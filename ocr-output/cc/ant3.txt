Introduction

Sri Caitanya-caritamrta is the principal work on the life and teachings of $n
Krsna Caitanya. Sri Caitanya is the pioneer of a great social and religious move-
ment which began in India a little less than five hundred years ago and which has
directly and indirectly influenced the subsequent course of religious and phi-
losophical thinking not only in India but in the recent West as well.

Caitanya Mahaprabhu is regarded as a figure of great historical significance.
However, our conventional method of historical analysis —that of seeing a man as
a product of his times —fails here. 511 Caitanya is a personality who transcends the
limited scope of historical settings.

At a time when, in the West, man was directing his explorative spirit toward
studying the structure of the physical universe and circumnavigating the world in
search of new oceans and continents, Sri Krsna Caitanya, in the East, was in-
augurating and masterminding a revolution directed inward, toward a scientific
understanding of the highest knowledge of man’s spiritual nature.

The chief historical sources for the life of $ri Krsna Caitanya are the kadacas (di-
aries) kept by Murari Gupta and SvarGpa Damodara Gosvami. Murari Gupta, a
physician and close associate of Sri Caitanya’s, recorded extensive notes on the
first twenty-four years of Sri Caitanya'’s life, culminating in his initiation into the
renounced order, sannyasa. The events of the rest of Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s for-
ty-eight years are recorded in the diary of Svarapa Damodora Gosvami, another of
Caitanya Mahaprabhu'’s intimate associates.

$ri Caitanya-caritamrta is divided into three sections called lilas, which literally
means “pastimes” — Adi-lila (the early period), Madhya-Iila (the middle period)
and Antya-Iila (the final period). The notes of Murari Gupta form the basis of the
441 -1112, and SvarGpa Damodara’s diary provides the details for the Madhya- and
Antya-lilas.

The first twelve of the seventeen chapters of Adi-lila constitute the preface for
the entire work. By referring to Vedic scriptural evidence, this preface establishes
Sri Caitanya as the avatdra (incarnation) of Krsna (God) for the age of Kali—the
current epoch, beginning five thousand years ago and characterized by material-
ism, hypocrisy and dissension. In these descriptions, Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who
is identical with Lord Krsna, descends to liberally grant pure love of God to the
fallen souls of this degraded age by propagating sarnkirtana—literally,
“congregational glorification of God” —especially by organizing massive public
chanting of the maha-mantra (Great Chant for Deliverance). The esoteric purpose
of Lord Caitanya’s appearance in the world is revealed, his co-avataras and prin-
cipal devotees are described and his teachings are summarized. The remaining
portion of Adi-lila, chapters thirteen through seventeen, briefly recounts his
divine birth and his life until he accepted the renounced order. This includes his
childhood miracles, schooling, marriage and early philosophical confrontations, as
well as his organization of a widespread sankirtana movement and his civil disobe-
dience against the repression of the Mohammedan government.

$ri Caitanya-caritamrta

The subject of Madhya-lila, the longest of the three divisions, is a detailed nar-
ration of Lord Caitanya’s extensive and eventful travels throughout India as a
renounced mendicant, teacher, philosopher, spiritual preceptor and mystic. Dur-
ing this period of six years, ऽ Caitanya transmits his teachings to his principal dis-
ciples. He debates and converts many of the most renowned philosophers and
theologians of his time, including Sankarites, Buddhists and Muslims, and incor-
porates their many thousands of followers and disciples into his own burgeoning
numbers. A dramatic account of Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s miraculous activities at
the giant Jagannatha Cart Festival in Orissa is also included in this section.

Antya-lila concerns the last eighteen years of ऽ Caitanya’s manifest presence,
spent in semiseclusion near the famous Jagannatha temple at Jagannatha 1201 in
Orissa. During these final years, ऽ Caitanya drifted deeper and deeper into
trances of spiritual ecstasy unparalleled in all of religious and literary history,
Eastern or Western. 6 Caitanya’s perpetual and ever-increasing religious
beatitude, graphically described in the eyewitness accounts of Svaripa Damodara
Gosvami, his constant companion during this period, clearly defy the investigative
and descriptive abilities of modern psychologists and phenomenologists of
religious experience.

The author of this great classic, Krsnadasa Kavirdgja Gosvami, born in the year
1507, was a disciple of Raghunatha dasa Gosvami, a confidential follower of
Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Raghunatha dasa, a renowned ascetic saint, heard and
memorized all the activities of Caitanya Mahaprabhu told to him by Svaripa
Damodara. After the passing away of Sif Caitanya and Svaripa Damodara,
Raghunatha dasa, unable to bear the pain of separation from these objects of his
complete devotion, traveled to Vrndavana, intending to commit suicide by jump-
ing from Govardhana Hill. In Vrndavana, however, he encountered Ripa Gosvami
and Sanatana Gosvami, the most confidential disciples of Caitanya Mahaprabhu.
They convinced him to give up his plan of suicide and impelled him to reveal to
them the spiritually inspiring events of Lord Caitanya'’s later life. Krsnadasa Kavirdja
Gosvami was also residing in Vrndavana at this time, and Raghunitha dasa
Gosvami endowed him with a full comprehension of the transcendental life of ऽ
Caitanya.

By this time, several biographical works had already been written on the life of
$i Caitanya by contemporary and near-contemporary scholars and devotees.
These included $ Caitanya-carita by Murari Gupta, Caitanya-marigala by Locana
dasa Thakura and Caitanya-bhagavata. This latter text, a work by Vrndavana dasa
Thakura, who was then considered the principal authority on 5 Caitanya’s life,
was highly revered. While composing his important work, Vrndavana dasa, fearing
that it would become too voluminous, avoided elaborately describing many of
the events of § Caitanya's life, particulary the later ones. Anxious to hear of these
later pastimes, the devotees of Vrndavana requested Krsnadasa Kavirdja Gosvami,
whom they respected as a great saint, to compose a book to narrate these

$ri Caitanya-caritamrta
episodes in detail. Upon this request, and with the permission and blessings of the
Madana-mohana Deity of Vrndavana, he began compiling Sri Caitanya-caritamrta,
which, due to its biographical excellence and thorough exposition of Lord
Caitanya’s profound philosophy and teachings, is regarded as the most significant
of biographical works on 51 Caitanya.

He commenced work on the text while in his late nineties and in failing health,
as he vividly describes in the text itself: “I have now become too old and dis-
turbed in invalidity. While writing, my hands tremble. | cannot remember any-
thing, nor can | see or hear properly. Still | write, and this is a great wonder.” That
he nevertheless completed, under such debilitating conditions, the greatest liter-
ary gem of medieval India is surely one of the wonders of literary history.

This English translation and commentary is the work of His Divine Grace A.C.
Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the world’s most distinguished teacher of In-
dian religious and philosophical thought. His commentary is based upon two
Bengali commentaries, one by his teacher Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami,
the eminent Vedic scholar who predicted, “The time will come when the people
of the world will learn Bengali to read $ri Caitanya-caritamrta,” and the other by
Srila Bhaktisiddhanta’s father, Bhaktivinoda Thakura.

His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada is himself a disciplic
descendant of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and he is the first scholar to execute
systematic English translations of the major works of Sri Caitanya’s followers. His
consummate Bengali and Sanskrit scholarship and intimate familiarity with the
precepts of Sri Krsna Caitanya are a fitting combination that eminently qualifies
him to present this important classic to the English-speaking world. The ease and
clarity with which he expounds upon difficult philosophical concepts lures even a
reader totally unfamiliar with Indian religious tradition into a genuine understand-
ing and appreciation of this profound and monumental work.

The entire text, with commentary, presented in seventeen lavishly illustrated
volumes by the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, represents a contribution of major im-
portance to the intellectual, cultural and spiritual life of contemporary man.

CHAPTER 7
The Meeting of
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and Vallabha Bhatta
The following summary of Chapter Seven is given by Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura in
his Amrta-pravaha-bhasya. In this chapter, Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s meet-
ing with Vallabha Bhatta is described. There was some joking behavior between
these two personalities, and finally ৩17 Caitanya Mahaprabhu corrected Vallabha
Bhatta and sympathetically accepted an invitation from him. Before this, Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu saw that Vallabha Bhatta was greatly attached to
Cadadhara Pandita. Therefore He acted as if displeased with Gadadhara Pandita.
Later, when Vallabha Bhatta became intimately connected with the Lord, the Lord
advised him to take instructions from Gadadhara Pandita. Thus the Lord expressed
His feelings of love for Cadadhara Pandita.

Sri Madhvacarya has brought our attention to this quotation from the
Narayana-sambhita:


--- Page 10 ---
Text 13] Lord Caitanya Meets Vallabha Bhatta 7
dvapariyair janair visnuh
paricaratrais ca kevalaih
kalau tu nama-matrena
pajyate bhagavan harih
“In the Dvapara-yuga one could satisfy Krsna or Visnu only by worshiping opu-
lently according to the paricaratriki system, but in the age of Kali one can satisfy
and worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead Hari simply by chanting His
holy name.” $rila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura explains that unless one is
directly empowered by the causeless mercy of Krsna, one cannot become the
spiritual master of the entire world (jagad-guru). One cannot become an acarya
simply by mental speculation. The true acarya presents Krsna to everyone by
preaching the holy name of the Lord throughout the world. Thus the conditioned
souls, purified by chanting the holy name, are liberated from the blazing fire of
material existence. In this way, spiritual benefit grows increasingly full, like the
waxing moon in the sky. The true acarya, the spiritual master of the entire world,
must be considered an incarnation of Krsna's mercy. Indeed, he is personally
embracing Krsna. He is therefore the spiritual master of all the varpas (brahmana,
ksatriya, vaisya and sadra) and all the asramas (brahmacarya, grhastha, vanaprastha
and sannyasa). Since he is understood to be the most advanced devotee, he is
called paramaharnsa-thakura. Thakura is a title of honor offered to the
paramaharisa. Therefore one who acts as an acarya, directly presenting Lord Krsna
by spreading His name and fame, is also to be called paramaharnsa-thakura.

tate —therefore; prema-bhakti—devotional service in ecstatic love; purusa-

TRANSLATION
“Through the mercy of Ramananda Raya, | have understood that ecstatic
love of Krsna is the highest goal of life and that spontaneous love of Krsna is
the highest perfection.
PURPORT
Purusartha (“the goal of life”) generally refers to religion, economic develop-
ment, satisfaction of the senses and, finally, liberation. However, above these four
kinds of purusarthas, love of Godhead stands supreme. It is called parama-
purusartha (the supreme goal of life) or purusartha-siromani (the most exalted of
all purusarthas). Lord Krsna is worshiped by regulative devotional service, but the
highest perfection of devotional service is spontaneous love of Godhead.

TRANSLATION
^“ ‘The gopis of Vrndavana have given up the association of their husbands,
sons and other family members, who are very difficult to give up, and they
have forsaken the path of chastity to take shelter of the lotus feet of Mukunda,
Krsna, which one should search for by Vedic knowledge. Oh, let me be fortu-
nate enough to be one of the bushes, creepers or herbs in Vrndavana because
the gopis trample them and bless them with the dust of their lotus feet.’
PURPORT
This verse from S$rimad-Bhagavatam (10.47.61) was spoken by Uddhava. When
Uddhava was sent by Krsna to see the condition of the gopis in Vrndavana, he
stayed there for a few months in their association and always talked with them
about Krsna. Although this greatly pleased the gopis and other residents of Vra-
jabhami, Vrndavana, Uddhava saw that the gopis were severely afflicted by their

separation from Krsna. Their hearts were so disturbed that their minds were some-
times deranged. Observing the unalloyed devotion and love of the gopis for
Krsna, Uddhava desired to become a creeper, a blade of grass or an herb in
Vrndavana so that sometimes the gopis would trample him and he would receive
the dust of their lotus feet on his head.

SYNONYMS
bhattera hrdaye—in the heart of Vallabha Bhatta; drdha—fixed; abhimana—
pride; jani’—understanding; bhangi kari’—making a hint; mahaprabhu—Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu; kahe —spoke; eta vani—these words.
TRANSLATION
Knowing that Vallabha Bhatta’s heart was full of pride, Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu spoke these words, hinting at how one can learn about devo-
tional service.
PURPORT
Vallabha Bhatta was greatly proud of his knowledge in devotional service, and
therefore he wanted to speak about Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu without
understanding the Lord's position. The Lord therefore hinted in many ways that if
Vallabha Bhatta wanted to know what devotional service actually is, he would
have to learn from all the devotees He mentioned, beginning with Advaita
Acarya, Lord Nityananda, Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya and Ramananda Raya. As
Svartipa Damodara has said, if one wants to learn the meaning of Srimad-
Bhagavatam, one must take lessons from a realized soul. One should not proudly
think that one can understand the transcendental loving service of the Lord
simply by reading books. One must become a servant of a Vaisnava. As Narot-
tama dasa Thakura has confirmed, chadiya vaispava-seva nistara payeche keba:
one cannot be in a transcendental position unless one very faithfully serves a pure
Vaisnava. One must accept a Vaisnava guru (adau gurv-asrayam), and then by
questions and answers one should gradually learn what pure devotional service to
Krsna is. That is called the parampara system.

By various hints and refutations, Lord Caitanya, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, corrected Vallabha Bhatta exactly as Krsna had cut down the false
pride of Indra.
PURPORT
Indra, the King of heaven, was very proud of his position. Therefore when the
residents of Vrndavana decided not to perform the Indra-yajiia but to perform the
Covardhana-yajia in accordance with the instructions of Krsna, Indra, because of
his false pride, wanted to chastise the residents of Vrndavana. Thinking himself
extremely powerful, Indra poured incessant rain upon Vrndavana, but Lord Krsna
immediately cut down his pride by lifting the Govardhana Hill as an umbrella to
save the residents of Vrndavana. In this way Krsna proved Indra’s power most in-
significant in the presence of His own omnipotence.

follow his. The parampara system does not allow one to deviate from the com-
mentaries of the previous acaryas. By depending upon the previous acaryas, one
can write beautiful commentaries. However, one cannot defy the previous
dcaryas. The false pride that makes one think that he can write better than the
previous acdryas will make one’s comments faulty. At the present moment it has
become fashionable for everyone to write in his own way, but such writing is
never accepted by serious devotees. Because of false pride, every scholar and phi-
losopher wants to exhibit his learning by interpreting the sastras, especially
Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam, in his own way. This system of comment-
ing in one’s own way is fully condemned by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Therefore
He says, ‘artha-vyasta’ likhana sei. Commentaries written according to one’s own
philosophical way are never accepted; no one will appreciate such commentaries
on the revealed scriptures.

Joking with Rukminidevi in Dvaraka, Krsna once advised her to accept another
husband because He thought Himself unfit for her. Rukminidevi, however, unable
to understand His joking words, took them very seriously and immediately fell to
the ground in fear of separation from Him. In the pastimes of Lord $ri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu, Jagadananda Pandita was always in disagreement with the Lord like
Satyabhama, whereas Gadadhara Pandita was always awed by the Lord's opu-
lence and was therefore submissive to the Lord under all circumstances.

learned scholar. The Lord neglected Gadadhara Pandita for a few days because of
his associating with Vallabha Bhatta. Actually He was not at all displeased with
Gadadhara Pandita. Indeed, because Gadadhara Pandita is the personal potency
of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu, there is no chance of the Lord's being dissatisfied
with him. However, a person who is too attracted to externals cannot understand

CHAPTER 8
Ramacandra Puri Criticizes the Lord
The following summary of the Eighth Chapter is given by Srila Bhaktivinoda
Thakura in his Amrta-pravaha-bhasya. This chapter describes the history of the
Lord's dealings with Ramacandra Puri. Although Ramacandra Puri was one of the
disciples of Madhavendra Puri, he was influenced by dry Mayavadis, and
therefore he criticized Madhavendra Puri. Therefore Madhavendra Puri accused
him of being an offender and rejected him. Because Ramacandra Puri had been re-
jected by his spiritual master, he became concerned only with finding faults in
others and advising them according to dry Mayavada philosophy. For this reason
he was not very respectful to the Vaisnavas, and later he became so fallen that he
began criticizing Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu for His eating. Hearing his criticisms, Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu reduced His eating, but after Raimacandra Puri left Jagan-
natha Puri, the Lord resumed His usual behavior.

Text 9] Ramacandra Puri Criticizes the Lord 87
Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura comments that although Ramacandra Puri was
naturally very envious and although he was against the principles of Vaisnavism—
or, in other words, against the principles of the Supreme Personality of Godhead
and His devotees —common people nevertheless addressed him as Gosvami or
(00581 because he was superficially in the renounced order and dressed like a
sannyasi. In the modern age the title gosvami is used by a caste of grhasthas, but
formerly it was not. Ripa Gosvami and Sanatana Gosvami, for example, were
called gosvami because they were in the renounced order. Similarly, because
Paramananda Puri was a sannydsi, he was called Puri Gosvami. By careful scrutiny,
therefore, one will find that gosvami is not the title for a certain caste; rather, it is
properly the title for a person in the renounced order.

Sri Caitanya Mahiprabhu also offered obeisances unto Rimacandra Puri,

who then embraced Him and thus remembered Krsna.
PURPORT

৩11 Caitanya Mahaprabhu offered obeisances to Ramacandra 1201 in considera-
tion of his being a disciple of Srila Madhavendra Puri, the spiritual master of His
own spiritual master, Tévara Purl. When a Vaisnava sannydsi meets another
Vaisnava sannydsi, they both remember Krsna. Even Mayavadi sannyasis generally
remember Narayana, who is also Krsna, by saying 0/7 namo bhagavate narayana or
namo nardyana. Thus it is the duty of a sannydasi to remember Krsna. According to
smurti-sastra, a sannyasi does not offer obeisances or blessings to anyone. It is said,
sannyadsi nirdsir nirnamaskriyah: a sannyasi should not offer anyone blessings or
obeisances.

As stated in Bhagavad-gita, brahma-bhdatah prasannatma: a Brahman realized
person is always happy. Na socati na karksati: he neither laments nor aspires for
anything. Not knowing why Madhavendra Puri was crying, Ramacandra Puri tried
to become his advisor. Thus he committed a great offense, for a disciple should
never try to instruct his spiritual master.

TRANSLATION
Hearing this instruction, Madhavendra Puri, greatly angry, rebuked him by
saying, ‘‘Get out, you sinful rascal!
PURPORT
Ramacandra Puri could not understand that his spiritual master, Madhavendra
Puri, was feeling transcendental separation. His lamentation was not material.
Rather, it proceeded from the highest stage of ecstatic love of Krsna. When he
was crying in separation, “I could not achieve Krsna! | could not reach Mathura!”
this was not ordinary material lamentation. Ramacandra Puri was not sufficiently
expert to understand the feelings of Madhavendra Puri, but nevertheless he
thought himself very advanced. Therefore, regarding Madhavendra Puri’s expres-
sions as ordinary material lamentation, he advised him to remember Brahman be-
cause he was latently an impersonalist. Madhavendra Puri understood Rama-
candra Puri’s position as a great fool and therefore immediately rebuked him. Such
a reprimand from the spiritual master is certainly for the betterment of the disci-
ple.

SYNONYMS
ei—this; ye—that; sri-madhavendra sri-pada—His Lordship Madhavendra Purf;
upeksa karila—neglected or denounced; sei aparadhe —because of the offense;
inhara—of Ramacandra Puri; vasana —material desire; janmila—arose.
TRANSLATION
Ramacandra Puri was thus denounced by Madhavendra Puri. Due to his
offense, gradually material desire appeared within him.
PURPORT
The word vasana (“material desires”) refers to dry speculative knowledge. Such
speculative knowledge is only material. As confirmed in Srimad-Bhagavatam
(10.14.4), a person without devotional service who simply wants to know things
(kevala-bodha-labdhaye) gains only dry speculative knowledge but no spiritual
profit. This is also confirmed in the Bhakti-sandarbha (111), wherein it is said:
jivan-mukta api punar
yanti samsara-vasanam
yady acintya-maha-saktau
bhagavaty aparadhinah
“Even though one is liberated in this life, if one offends the Supreme Personality of
Codhead he falls down in the midst of material desires, of which dry speculation
about spiritual realization is one.” ॥
In his Laghu-tosani commentary on Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.2.32), Jiva Gosvami
says;
jivan-mukta api punar
bandhanarn yanti karmabhih
yady acintya-maha-saktau
bhagavaty aparadhinah


--- Page 99 ---
96 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Antya-lila, Ch. 8
“Even if one is liberated in this life, he becomes addicted to material desires be-
cause of offenses to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.”

A similar quotation from one of the Puranas also appears in the Visnu-bhakti-
candrodaya:

jivan-muktah prapadyante
kvacit sarhsara-vasanam
yogino na vilipyante
karmabhir bhagavat-parah
“Even liberated souls sometimes fall down to material desires, but those who fully
engaged in devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead are not
affected by such desires.”

These are references from authoritative revealed scriptures. If one becomes an
offender to his spiritual master or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he falls
down to the material platform to merely speculate.

suska—dry; brahma-jiaani—impersonalist philosopher; nahi—there is not;
krsnera—with Lord Krsna; sambandha—relationship; sarva—all; loka—persons;
ninda kare —criticizes; nindate nirbandha—fixed in blaspheming.

TRANSLATION

One who is attached to dry speculative knowledge has no relationship with

Krsna. His occupation is criticizing Vaisnavas. Thus he is situated in criticism.
PURPORT

Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura has explained in his Anubhasya that the
word nirbandha indicates that Ramacandra Puri had a steady desire to criticize
others. Impersonalist Mayavadis who have no relationship with Krsna, who can-
not take to devotional service and who simply engage in material arguments to
understand Brahman regard devotional service to Krsna as karma-kanda, or fru-
itive activities. According to them, devotional service to Krsna is but another
means for attaining dharma, artha, kama and moksa. Therefore they criticize the
devotees for engaging in material activities. They think that devotional service is

maya and that Krsna or Visnu is also maya. Therefore they are called 143৮3৬30175.
Such a mentality awakens in a person who is an offender to Krsna and His devo-
tees.

they must have been there because Caitanya Mahaprabhu had been eating
sweetmeats. He thus discovered imaginary faults in the Lord and then left.

Text 80] Ramacandra Puri Criticizes the Lord 119
TEXT 79

tara madhye parva-vidhi ‘prasarmsa’ chadiya
para-vidhi ‘ninda’ kare ‘balistha’ janiya
SYNONYMS
tara madhye —between the two; parva-vidhi—the former rule; prdsamsa—
praising; chadiya—giving up; para-vidhi—the other rule; ninda—criticizing;
kare —does; balistha janiya—knowing it to be more prominent.
TRANSLATION
“Of the two rules, Ramacandra Puri obeys the first by abandoning praise,
but although he knows that the second is more prominent, he neglects it by
criticizing others.
PURPORT
The above-mentioned verse from Srimad-Bhagavatam gives two injunctions.
The first, called parva-vidhi, is that one should not praise, and the second, para-
vidhi, is that one should not criticize. As will be apparent from the following verse,
the injunction against praise is less important than the injunction against
blasphemy. One should carefully observe the para-vidhi, although one may
neglect the parva-vidhi. Thus the actual injunction is that one may praise but
should not criticize. This is called slesokti, or a statement having two meanings.
Ramacandra Puri, however, acted in just the opposite way, for he neglected the
para-vidhi but strictly observed the parva-vidhi. Since he avoided following the
principle of not criticizing, Ramacandra Puri broke both the rules.

The Deliverance of Gopinatha Pattanayaka
This Ninth Chapter is summarized as follows. Gopinatha Pattanayaka, the son of
Bhavananda Raya, was engaged in the service of the government, but he misap-

tanayaka was raised on the canga to be killed, but by the mercy of Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu he was delivered. Moreover, he was even promoted to a higher

Prahlada Maharaja, Bali Maharaja, Vyasadeva, Sukadeva Gosvami and other
great sages came to visit Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Upon seeing Him, they be-

PURPORT
According to the opinion of some historians, Prahlada Maharaja was born in
Treta-yuga in the city of Milatana in the state of Punjab. He was born of
Hiranyakasipu, a king of the dynasty of Kasyapa. Prahlada Maharaja was a great
devotee of Lord Visnu, but his father was very much against Visnu. Because the
father and son thus differed in their consciousness, the demon father inflicted all


--- Page 139 ---
136 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Antya-lili, Ch. 9
kinds of bodily pain upon Prahlada. When this torture became intolerable, the
Supreme Lord appeared as Nrsimhadeva and killed the great demon
Hiranyakasipu.

Bali Maharaja was the grandson of Prahlada Maharaja. The son of Prahlada
Maharaja was Virocana, and his son was known as Bali. Appearing as Vamana and
begging Bali Maharaja for three feet of land, the Lord took possession of the entire
three worlds. Thus Bali Maharaja became a great devotee of Lord Vamana. Bali
Maharaja had one hundred sons, of whom Maharaja Bana was the eldest and
most famous.

Vyasadeva was the son of the great sage Parasara. Other names for him are
Satyavateya and Krsna-dvaipayana Badarayana Muni. As one of the authorities on
the Vedas, he divided the original Veda, for convenience, into four divisions —
Sama, Yajur, Rg and Atharva. He is the author of eighteen Puranas as well as the
theosophical thesis Brahma-satra and its natural commentary, Srimad-
Bhagavatam. He belongs to the Brahma-sampradaya and is a direct disciple of
Narada Muni.

Sukadeva Cosvami is the son of Vyasadeva. He was a brahmacari fully con-
scious of Brahman realization, but later he became a great devotee of Lord Krsna.
He narrated Srimad-Bhagavatam to Maharaja Pariksit.

raised on the canga.

PURPORT

The carga was a device for killing a condemned person. It consisted of a raised
platform on which the condemned was made to stand. Underneath the platform,
there were stationary upright swords. The condemned man would be pushed
down onto the swords, and in this way he would die. For some reason, Gopinatha
Pattanayaka had been condemned to death and had therefore been raised upon
the canga.

--- Page 163 ---
160 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Antya-lila, Ch. 9
PURPORT
The Supreme Personality of Godhead will certainly protect a devotee who does
something sinful accidentally. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (9.30-31):
api cet suduracaro
bhajate mam ananya-bhak
sadhur eva sa mantavyah
sarnyag vyavasito hi sah
ksiprarh bhavati dharmatma
sasvac-chantirn nigacchati
kaunteya pratijanihi
na me bhaktah pranasyati
“Even if one commits the most abominable actions, if he is engaged in devotional
service, he is to be considered saintly because he is properly situated. He quickly
becomes righteous and attains lasting peace. O son of Kunti, declare it boldly that
My devotee never perishes.” However, if a devotee or so-called devotee pur-
posefully commits sinful activities continually in the hope that Krsna will give him
protection, Krsna will not protect him. Therefore Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu said,
kali ke rakhibe, yadi na dibe raja-dhana?: “19891773073 has saved Gopinatha Pat-
tanayaka from being killed by the King today, but if he commits the same offense
again, who will give him protection?” $f Caitanya Mahaprabhu thus warns all
such foolish devotees that Jagannatha will not protect them if they continue to
commit offenses.

TRANSLATION
‘You are a renounced sannyasi. What connections do You have? One who

PURPORT
Becoming a devotee of the Lord to serve material purposes is a great mistake.
Many people become showbottle devotees for material profits. Indeed ma-
terialistic persons sometimes take to professional devotional service and keep
Visnu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as a means of livelihood. None of
this, however, is approved. In the book known as Sapta-sati, as mentioned by Srila


--- Page 165 ---
162 $ri Caitanya-caritaimrta [Antya-lila, Ch. 9
Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura, one can discover how a person worshiping the
goddess Durga begs her for different varieties of material profit. Such activities are
very popular among people in general, but they are the attempts of foolish, blind
people (sei jaana-andha).

A materialist does not actually know why one should become a devotee. A
devotee’s only concern is to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Pure
devotional service is defined by Srila Rapa Gosvami:

anyabhilasita-sanyarm
jAana-karmady-anavrtam
anukalyena krspanu-
Silanarin bhaktir uttama
One should be completely free from all material desires and should serve Krsna
simply to please Him. When people become interested in their own sense grati-
fication (bhukti mukti siddhi kami, some of them desire to enjoy the material
world to the fullest extent, some of them desire to be liberated and merge into
the existence of Brahman, and others want to perform magic through mystic
power and thus become incarnations of God. These are all against the principles
of devotional service. One must be free from all material desires. The desire of the
impersonalist to merge into the existence of Brahman is also material because
such an impersonalist wants to gratify his senses by merging into the existence of
Krsna instead of serving His lotus feet. Even if such a person merges into the Brah-
man effulgence, he falls down again into material existence. As stated in Srimad-
Bhagavatam (10.2.32):
aruhya krcchrena paran padarn tatah
patanty adho ‘nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah
Because Mayavadi philosophers have no information regarding the transcenden-
tal service of the Lord, even after attaining liberation from material activities and
merging in the Brahman effulgence, they must come down again to this material
world.

SYNONYMS

tomara— Your; bhajana—devotional service; phale —by the result of; tomate —

bhaje—one engages in Your service; sei—he; mdrkha jana—a fool.

TRANSLATION

Kasi Misra continued, “If one engages in devotional service for Your
satisfaction, this will result in his increasingly awakening his dormant love for
You. But if one engages in Your devotional service for material purposes, he
should be considered a number-one fool.

PURPORT

Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura comments that there are many ma-
terialistic persons who become preachers, gurus, religionists or philosophers only
for the sake of maintaining a high standard of living and sense gratification for
themselves and their families. Sometimes they adopt the dress of a sannyasi or
preacher. They train some of their family members as lawyers and continually
seek help from a high court to acquire riches on the plea of maintaining temples.
Although such persons may call themselves preachers, live in Vrndavana or
Navadvipa, and also print many religious books, it is all for the same purpose,
namely to earn a living to maintain their wives and children. They may also profes-
sionally recite the Bhagavatam or other scriptures, worship the Deity in the temple
and initiate disciples. Making a show of devotional paraphernalia, they may also
collect money from the public and use it to cure the disease of some family mem-
ber or near relative. Sometimes they become babajis or collect money on the plea
of worshiping the poor, whom they call daridra-narayana, or for social and politi-
cal upliftment. Thus they spread a network of business schemes to collect money
for sense gratification by cheating people in general who have no knowledge of
pure devotional service. Such cheaters cannot understand that by offering devo-
tional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one can be elevated to a
position of eternal servitude to the Lord, which is even greater than the position
of Brahma and other demigods. Unfortunately, fools have no understanding of the
perpetual pleasure of devotional service.

the idea that the money forfeited to Gopinatha Pattanayaka was indirectly a con-
tribution to Him. Therefore He immediately protested.

The kaudi is like an American cent or Japanese yen. In the old medium of ex-

kaudis made one ganda, twenty gandas made one pana, and sixteen panas made

King absolved him of this debt, reappointed him to his post and doubled his
salary.

Near Rijamahendri is a famous railway station. Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati
notes that the present Rajamahendri City is located on the northern bank of the
Codabvari. At the time when Ramananda Raya was governor, however, the state
capital, which was known as Vidyanagara or Vidyapura, was located on the
southern side of the Godavari, at the confluence of the Godavari and the sea.
That was the part of the country which at that time was known as Rajamahendri.
North of Kalinga-desa is Utkalinga, or the state of Orissa. The capital of southern
Orissa was known as Rajamahendri, but now the location of Rajamahendri has
changed.

TRANSLATION
‘However, my Lord, these are not the principal results of meditating upon
Your lotus feet. Material opulence is very flickering. Therefore it is simply a
glimpse of the result of Your mercy.
PURPORT
One can achieve the highest perfection of life simply by meditating upon the
lotus feet of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Generally people are concerned with the
four religious principles, namely religion, material opulence, sense gratification and
liberation. However, as indicated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (dharmah projjhita-
kaitavo tra), success in these four kinds of material and spiritual gain are not the
true results of devotional service. The true result of devotional service is the actual
development of one’s dormant love for Krsna in every circumstance. By the mercy
of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, Gopinatha Pattanayaka could understand that the
material benefits he had achieved were not the ultimate result of meditating upon
His lotus feet. The true result comes when one is detached from material opu-
lences. Therefore Gopinatha Pattanayaka prayed to the Lord for such detachment.

ways think that he is an eternal servant of God, for that is the real position of the
living being. Taking sannyasa and dealing in pounds, shillings and pence are both
external affairs. One should always consider how to please and satisfy Krsna. Thus
even if one is involved in great material affairs, he will not become attached. As
soon as one forgets that he is an eternal servant of Krsna, he becomes involved in
material attachments. However, if one is always conscious that Krsna is always the
supreme master and that he is an eternal servant of Krsna, he is a liberated person
in any condition. Entangling material activities will not affect him.

Text 144] The Deliverance of Gopinatha Pattanayaka 197
PURPORT
When a person forgets his position as an eternal servant of Krsna, he commits
many sinful activities, but one who maintains his position as an eternal servant of
Krsna cannot deviate from the path of morality, religion and ethics. At the present,
people all over the world, especially in India, have forgotten their relationship
with the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His eternal servants. Therefore the
principles of morality, religion and ethics have almost disappeared. This situation
is most unprofitable for human society. Therefore everyone should try to accept
Krsna consciousness and follow the principles of rf Caitanya Mahaprabhu.

PURPORT
The result of advancement in spiritual knowledge is not material improvement,
but Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu advised Gopinatha Pattanayaka how to use material
opulence without incurring reactions to sinful life. From this advice, it appeared
that the Lord encouraged Gopinatha Pattanayaka to enhance his material condi-
tion. Actually, however, He did not. In fact, this was but a manifestation of His
great affection for His devotee.

200 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Antya-lila, Ch. 9
TRANSLATION
Indeed, when all the devotees had requested the Lord to bestow His mercy
upon Gopinatha Pattanayaka, the Lord had replied that He could do nothing.
PURPORT
When a person is sinful, he loses both the chance for spiritual advancement and
the chance for materia! opulence. If one enjoys the material world for sense grati-
fication, he is certainly doomed. Advancement in material opulence is not the
direct mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; nevertheless, it indicates
the indirect mercy of the Lord, for even a person too attached to material
prosperity can gradually be detached and raised to the spiritual platform. Then he
can offer causeless, purified service to the Lord. When 5r1 Caitanya 5310, 3/773 haite
kichu nahe (“It is not My business to do anything”), He set the ideal example for a
person in the renounced order. If a sannyasi takes the side of a visayi, a person
engaged in material activities, his character will be criticized. A person in the
renounced order should not take interest in material activities, but if he does so
out of affection for a particular person, that should be considered his special
mercy.

CHAPTER 10
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu
Accepts Prasada from the Devotees

The following summary of Chapter Ten is given by Bhaktivinoda Thakura in his
Amrta-pravaha-bhasya. Before the Ratha-yatra ceremony, all the devotees from
Bengal started for Jagannatha Puri as usual. Raghava Pandita brought with him
various kinds of food for Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. The food had been cooked by
his sister, whose name was Damayanti, and the stock was generally known as
raghavera jhali. Makaradhvaja Kara, an inhabitant of Panihati who accompanied
RaghavaPandita, was the secretary in charge of accounting for the raghavera jhali,
the bags of food carried by Raghava Pandita.

The day when all the devotees arrived at Jagannatha Puri, Lord Govinda was
enjoying sporting pastimes in the water of Narendra-sarovara. $ri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu also enjoyed the ceremony in the water with His devotees. As pre-
viously, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu performed the cleansing ceremony at Gundica
and chanted the famous verse jagamohana-pari-munda yau. After kirtana ended,
He distributed prasada to all the devotees and also took some Himself. Then He
lay down at the door of the Gambhira to take rest. Somehow or other Govinda
came by and massaged His feet. Govinda could not go out that day, however, and
therefore he was unable to accept prasada. From the character of Govinda it is to
be learned that we may sometimes commit offenses for the service of the Lord,
but not for sense gratification.

Govinda, the personal servant of $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, induced the Lord to
eat all the food delivered by the devotees of Bengal for His service. All the
Vaisnavas used to invite Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu to their homes. The Lord ac-
cepted the invitation of Caitanya dasa, the son of Sivananda Sena, and ate rice
and yogurt there.

TRANSLATION
Because of her natural love for Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, Damayanti con-
sidered the Lord an ordinary human being. Therefore she thought that He
would become sick by overeating and there would be mucus within His abdo-
men.
PURPORT
Because of pure love, the devotees of Krsna in Goloka Vrndavana, Vrajabhami,
loved Krsna as an ordinary human being like them. Yet although they considered
Krsna one of them, their love for Krsna knew no bounds. Similarly, because of ex-
treme love, devotees like Raghava Pandita and his sister, Damayanti, thought of
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu as a human being, but their love for Him was boundless.
By overeating, an ordinary human being becomes prone to a disease called amla-
pitta, which is a product of indigestion characterized by acidity of the stomach.
Damayanti thought that such a condition would afflict Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.

246 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Antya-lila, Ch. 10
PURPORT
Karmis, fruitive workers, cannot understand the finer conclusions of devotional
service because they accept only its ritualistic value but do not understand how
devotional service satisfies the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The karmis view
the formalities as a means of advancing in religion, economic development, sen-
sual satisfaction and liberation. Although these are only material results of follow-
ing religious principles, the karmis consider them everything. Such ritualistic ac-
tivities are called karma. Karmis who adopt devotional service very loosely and
who therefore remain on the platform of material activities are called prakrta-
sahajiyas. They cannot understand how pure devotional service is rendered in
paternal and conjugal love, for this can be understood only by the special mercy
bestowed by $rf Caitanya Mahaprabhu upon pure devotees.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports to the $ri Caitanya-caritamrta, Antya-lila,
Tenth Chapter, describing how Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu tasted the prasada

The Author

His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada appeared in this world
in 1896 in Calcutta, India. He first met his spiritual master, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta
Sarasvati Gosvami, in Calcutta in 1922. Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati, a prominent
devotional scholar and the founder of sixty-four Gaudiya Mathas (Vedic In-
stitutes), liked this educated young man and convinced him to dedicate his life to
teaching Vedic knowledge. Srila Prabhupada became his student, and eleven
years later (1933) at Allahabad he became his formally initiated disciple.

At their first meeting, in 1922, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura requested
Srila Prabhupada to broadcast Vedic knowledge through the English language. In
the years that followed, $rila Prabhupada wrote a commentary on the Bhagavad-
gita, assisted the Gaudiya Matha in its work and, in 1944, without assistance,
started an English fortnightly magazine, edited it, typed the manuscripts and
checked the galley proofs. He even distributed the individual copies freely and
struggled to maintain the publication. Once begun, the magazine never stopped;
it is now being continued by his disciples in the West.

Recognizing Srila Prabhupada’s philosophical learning and devotion, the
Caudiya Vaisnava Society honored him in 1947 with the title “Bhaktivedanta.” In
1950, at the age of fifty-four, Srila Prabhupada retired from married life, and four
years later he adopted the vanaprastha (retired) order to devote more time to his
studies and writing. Srila Prabhupada traveled to the holy city of Vrndavana,
where he lived in very humble circumstances in the historic medieval temple of
Radha-Damodara. There he engaged for several years in deep study and writing.
He accepted the renounced order of life (sannyasa) in 1959. At Radha-Damodara,
Srila Prabhupada began work on his life's masterpiece: a multivolume translation
and commentary on the eighteen thousand verse Srimad-Bhagavatam
(Bhagavata Purana). He also wrote Easy Journey to Other Planets.

After publishing three volumes of Bhagavatam, Stila Prabhupada came to the
United States, in 1965, to fulfill the mission of his spiritual master. Since that time,
His Divine Grace has written over forty volumes of authoritative translations,
commentaries and summary studies of the philosophical and religious classics of
India.

In 1965, when he first arrived by freighter in New York City, Srila Prabhupada
was practically penniless. It was after almost a year of great difficulty that he
established the International Society for Krishna Consciousness in July of 1966.
Under his careful guidance, the Society has grown within a decade to a world-
wide confederation of almost one hundred asramas, schools, temples, institutes
and farm communities.

In 1968, Srila Prabhupada created New Vrndavana, an experimental Vedic com-
munity in the hills of West Virginia. Inspired by the success of New Vrndavana,
now a thriving farm community of more than one thousand acres, his students
have since founded several similar communities in the United States and abroad.

In 1972, His Divine Grace introduced the Vedic system of primary and second-
ary education in the West by founding the Gurukula school in Dallas, Texas. The
school began with 3 children in 1972, and by the beginning of 1975 the enroll-
ment had grown to 150.

Srila Prabhupada has also inspired the construction of a large international
center at Sridhama Mayapur in West Bengal, India, which is also the site for a
planned Institute of Vedic Studies. A similar project is the magnificent Krsna-
Balarama Temple and International Guest House in Vindavana, India. These are
centers where Westerners can live to gain firsthand experience of Vedic culture.

Srila Prabhupada’s most significant contribution, however, is his books. Highly
respected by the academic community for their authoritativeness, depth and
clarity, they are used as standard textbooks in numerous college courses. His
writings have been translated into eleven languages. The Bhaktivedanta Book
Trust, established in 1972 exclusively to publish the works of His Divine Grace,
has thus become the world’s largest publisher of books in the field of Indian
religion and philosophy. Its latest project is the publishing of Srila Prabhupada'’s
most recent work: a seventeen-volume translation and commentary —completed
by Srila Prabhupada in only eighteen months —on the Bengali religious classic Sri
Caitanya-caritamrta.

In the past ten years, in spite of his advanced age, Srila Prabhupada has circled
the globe twelve times on lecture tours that have taken him to six continents. In
spite of such a vigorous schedule, Srila Prabhupada continues to write prolifically.
His writings constitute a veritable library of Vedic philosophy, religion, literature
and culture.

Madhya-Ilila (the middle period), the
longest of the three, is a detailed narration of
Sri Caitanya’s extensive and eventful travels
throughout India as a renounced mendicant,
teacher, philosopher, spiritual preceptor and
mystic. Finally, Antya-/ila (the final period)
concerns the last eighteen years of Caitanya
Mahaprabhu’s manifest presence, spent in
semiseclusion in Jagannatha Puri, Orissa.
During these final years, Sri Caitanya drifted
deeper and deeper into trances of spiritual
ecstasy unparalleled in all of religious and
literary history, Eastern or Western.

, Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami, the author of
Sri Caitanya-caritamrta, was a great saint and
a confidential disciple and student of
Raghunatha dasa Gosvami, the renowned
ascetic saint who was one of the most inti-
mate disciples of Sri Caitanya. He com-
menced work on the text while in his late
nineties and in failing health, as he vividly
describes in the text itself: “I have now be-
come too old and disturbed in invalidity.
While writing, my hands tremble. | cannot
remember anything, nor can | see or hear
properly. Still ॥ write, and this is a great
wonder.” That he nevertheless completed,
under such debilitating conditions, the
greatest literary gem of medieval India is
surely one of the wonders of literary history.

The English translation and commentary is
the work of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhakti-
vedanta Swami Prabhupada, the world’s
most distinguished scholar and teacher of
Indian religious and philosophical thought.
He himself is a disciplic descendant of ऊन
Caitanya, and his intimate familiarity with
the precepts of Caitanya Mahaprabhu emi-
nently qualifies him to present this impor-
tant classic to the English-speaking world.
The ease and clarity with which he ex-
pounds upon Sri Caitanya’s precepts lures
even a reader totally unfamiliar with Indian
religious tradition into a genuine under-
standing and appreciation of this profound
and monumental work.

The entire text, with commentary, pre-
sented in seventeen lavishly illustrated
volumes by the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust,
represents a contribution of major impor-
tance to the intellectual, cultural and
spiritual life of contemporary man.
