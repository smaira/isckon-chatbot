the subject as he desired.

Vidura: One of the prominent figures in the history of the Mahabharata.
He was conceived by Vyasadeva in the womb of the maidservant of Am-

bika, mother of Maharaja Pandu. He is the incarnation of Yamaraja.
Being cursed by Manduka Muni, he was to become a sudra. The story is
narrated as follows. Once upon a time the state police caught some thieves
who concealed themselves in the hermitage of Manduka Muni. The police
constables, as usual, arrested all the thieves and Manduka Muni along with
them. The Magistrate specifically punished the muni to death by being
pierced with a lance. When he was just to be pierced, the news reached the
king, and he at once stopped the act on consideration of his being a great
muni. The king personally begged the muni’s pardon for the mistake of
his men, and the saint at once went to Yamaraja, who prescribes the
destiny of living beings. Yamaraja, being questioned by the muni, replied
that the muni in his childhood pierced an ant with a sharpened straw, and
for that reason he was put into difficulty. The muni thought it unwise on
the part of Yamaraja that he was punished for his childish innocence, and
thus the muni cursed Yamaraja to become a ৪807৫, and this sudra incar-
nation of Yamaraja was known as Vidura, the sudra brother of Dhrtarastra
and Maharaja Pandu. But this sudra son of the Kuru dynasty was equally
treated by Bhismadeva, along with his other nephews, and in due course
Vidura was married with a girl who was also born in the womb of a sudrant
by a brahmana. Although Vidura did not inherit the property of his
father (the brother of Bhismadeva), still he was given sufficient state pro-
perty by Dhrtarastra, the elder brother of Vidura. Vidura was very much
attached to his elder brother, and all along he tried to guide him in the
right path. During the fratricidal war of Kuruksetra, Vidura repeatedly
implored his elder brother to do justice to the sons of 81000, but
Duryodhana did not like such interference by his uncle, and thus he
practically insulted Vidura. This resulted in Vidura’s leaving home for

pilgrimage and taking instructions from Maitreya.

TRANSLATION

After asking various questions and becoming established in the tran-
scendental loving service of Lord Krsna, Vidura retired from putting
questions to Maitreya Muni.

PURPORT

Vidura retired from putting questions before Maitreya Muni when he
was convinced by Maitreya Rsi that the summun bonum of life is to be
finally situated in the transcendental loving service of Lord Sri Krsna, who
is Govinda or one who satisfies His devotees in all respects. The conditioned
soul or living being in material existence seeks happiness by employing his
senses in the modes of materialism, but that cannot give him satisfaction.
He then searches after the Supreme Truth by the empiric philosophical
speculative method and intellectual feats. But if he does not find the ulti-
mate goal, he again goes down to material activities and engages himself in
various philanthrophic and altruistic works, which all fail to give him satis-
faction. So neither fruitive activities nor dry philosophical speculation can
give one satisfaction because by nature a living being is the eternal servitor
of the Supreme Lord Sri Krsna, and all the Vedic literatures give him direc-
tion towards that ultimate end. The Bhagavad-gita confirms this statement
(Bg.15.15).

Like Vidura, an inquisitive conditioned soul must approach a bona fide
spiritual master like Maitreya and by intelligent inquiries must try to know
everything about karma (fruitive activities), jiiana (philosophical research
for the Supreme Truth)and yoga (the linking process of spiritual realiza-
tion). One who is not seriously inclined to put questions before a spiritual
master need not accommodate a show bottle spiritual master, nor should
a person who may be a spiritual master for others pose to be so if he is
unable to engage his disciple ultimately in the transcendental loving service
of Lord Sri Krsna. Vidura was successful in approaching a spiritual master
like Maitreya, and he got the ultimate goal of life: bhakti unto Govinda.
Thus there was nothing to be known further about spiritual progress.

When they saw Vidura return to the palace, all the inhabitants,
Maharaja Yudhisthira, his younger brothers, Dhrtarastra, Satyaki, Sanjaya,
Krpacarya, Kunti, Gandhari, Draupadi, Subhadra, Uttara, Krpi, and many
others, who were wives of the Kauravas, and other ladies with children,
all hurried to him in great delight. It so appeared that they had regained
their consciousness after a long period.
PURPORT
Gandhari: The ideal chaste lady in the history of the world. She was the
daughter of Maharaja Subala, the King of Gandhara (now Kandahar in
Kabul), and in her maiden state she worshiped Lord Siva. Lord Siva is
worshiped generally by the Hindu maidens to get a good husband.

Texts 3-4) Dhrtarastra Quits Home 665
Gandhari satisfied Lord Siva, and by his benediction to obtain one
hundred sons, she was betrothed to Dhrtarastra, despite his being
blind forever. When Gandhari came to know that her would-be husband
was a blind man, to follow her life companion she decided to become
voluntarily blind. So she wrapped up her eyes with many silk linens,
and she was married to Dhrtarastra under the guidance of her elder brother
Sakuni. She was the most beautiful girl of her time, and she was equally
qualified by her womanly qualities, which endeared every member of the
Kaurava court. But despite all her good qualities, she had the natural
frailties of a woman, and she was envious of Kunti when the latter gave
birth to a male child. Both the queens were pregnant, but Kunti first
gave birth to a male child. Thus Gandhari became angry and gave a blow
to her own abdomen. As a result, she gave birth to a lump of flesh only,
but since she was a devotee of Vyasadeva, by instruction of Vyasadeva the
lump was divided into one hundred parts, and each part gradually de-
veloped to become a male child. Thus her ambition to become the mother
of one hundred sons was fulfilled, and she began to nourish all the children
according to her exalted position. When the intrigue of the battlefield of
Kuruksetra was going on, she was not in favor of fighting with the
Pandavas; rather, she blamed Dhrtarastra, her husband, for such a fratri-
cidal war. She desired that the state be divided into two parts, for the sons
of Pandu and her own. She was very affected when all her sons died in the
Battle of Kuruksetra, and she wanted to curse Bhimasena and Yudhisthira,
but she was checked by Vyasadeva. Her mourning over the death of
Duryodhana and Duhsasana before Lord Krsna is very pitiful, and Lord
Krsna pacified her by transcendental messages. She was equally aggrieved
on the death of Karna, and she described to Lord Krsna the lamentation
of Karpa’s wife. She was pacified by Srila Vyasadeva when he showed her
dead sons, then promoted to the heavenly kingdoms. She died along with
her husband in the jungles of the Himalayas near the mouth of the Ganges;
she burned in a forest fire. Maharaja Yudhisthira performed the death
ceremony of his uncle and aunt.

Prtha: Daughter of Maharaja Siirasena and sister of Vasudeva, Lord
Krsna’s father. Later she was adopted by Maharaja Kuntibhoja, and hence
she is known as Kunti. She is the incarnation of the success potency of the
Personality of Godhead. The heavenly denizens from the upper planets
used to visit the palace of the King Kuntibhoja, and Kunti was engaged for
their reception. She also served the great mystic sage Durvasa, and being
satisfied by her faithful service, Durvasa Muni gave her a mantra by which
it was possible for her to call for any demigod she pleased. As a matter of
inquisitiveness, she at once called for the sun-god, who desired couplement


--- Page 6 ---
666 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 13
with her, but she declined. But the sun-god assured her immunity from
virgin adulteration, and so she agreed to his proposal. As a result of this
couplement, she became pregnant, and Karna was born by her. By the
grace of the sun, she again turned into a virgin girl, but being afraid of her
parents, she quitted the newly born child Karna. After that, when she
actually selected her own husband, she preferred Pandu to be her husband.
Maharaja Pandu later on wanted to retire from family life and adopt the
renounced order of life. Kunti refused to allow her husband to adopt such
life, but at last Maharaja Pandu gave her permission to become a mother
of sons by calling some other suitable personalities. Kunti did not accept
this proposal at first, but when vivid examples were set by Pandu she
agreed. Thus by dint of the mantra awarded by Durvasa Muni she called
for Dharmaraja, and thus Yudhisthira was born. She called for demigod
Vayu (air), and thus Bhima was born. She called for Indra, the King of
heaven, and thus Arjuna was born. The other two sons, namely Nakula
and Sahadeva, were begotten by Pandu himself in the womb of Madri.
Later on, Maharaja Pandu died at an early age, for which Kunti was so
aggrieved that she fainted. Two cowives, namely Kunti and Madri, decided
that Kunti should live for the maintenance of the five minor children, the
Pandavas, and Madri should accept the sati rituals by meeting voluntary
death along with her husband. This agreement was endorsed by great sages
like Satasriiga and others present on the occasion.

Later on, when the Pandavas were banished from the kingdom by the
intrigues of Duryodhana, Kunti followed her sons, and she equally faced
all sorts of difficulties during those days, During the forest life one demon
girl, Hidimbi, wanted Bhima as her husband, which was refused by Bhima,
but when the girl approached Kunti and Yudhisthira, they ordered Bhima
to accept her proposal and give her a son. As a result of this combination,
Ghatotkach was born, and he fought very valiantly with his father against
the Kauravas. In their forest life they lived with a brahmana family that
was in trouble because of one Bakasura demon, and Kunti ordered Bhima
to kill the Bakasura to protect the brahmana family against troubles
created by the demon. She advised Yudhisthira to start for the Paiicala-
१९६३. Draupadi was gained in this Pancala-desa by Arjuna, but by order of
Kunti all the five brothers of the Pandavas became equally the husbands of
Pancali or Draupadi. She was married with five Pandavas in the presence of
Vyasadeva. Kuntidevi never forgot her first child, Karna, and after Karna’s
death in the Battle of Kuruksetra she lamented and admitted before her
other sons that Karna was her eldest son prior to her marriage with
Maharaja Pandu. After the Battle of Kuruksetra, when Lord Krsna was
going back home, her prayers for the Lord are excellently explained. Later

she went to the forest with Gandhari for severe penance. She used to take
meals after each thirty days. She finally sat down in profound meditation
and later burned to ashes in a forest fire.

Draupadi: The most chaste daughter of Maharaja Drupada and partly an
incarnation of goddess Saci, the wife of Indra. Maharaja Drupada per-
formed a great sacrifice under the superintendence of the sage Yaja. By
his first offering, Dhrstadyumna was born, and by the second offering,
Draupadi was born. She is therefore the sister of Dhrstadyumna, and she
is also named Paiicali. The five Pandavas married her as a common wife,
and each of them begot a son in her. Maharaja Yudhisthira begot a son
named Pratibindh, Bhimasena begot a son named Sutasome, Arjuna begot
Srutakirti, Nakula begot Satanika, and Sahadeva begot Srutakama. She is
described as a most beautiful lady, equal to her mother-in-law Kunti.
During her birth there was an aero-message that she should be called
Krsna. The same message also declared that she is born to kill many a
ksatriya. By dint of her blessings from Sarikara, she was awarded five
husbands, equally qualified. When she preferred to select her own husband,
princes and kings were invited from all the countries of the world. She
was married with the Pandavas during their exile in the forest, but when
they went back home Maharaja Drupada gave them immense wealth as a
dowry. She was well received by all the daughters-in-law of Dhrtarastra.
When she was lost in a gambling game, she was forcibly dragged into the
assembly hall, and an attempt was made to see her naked beauty by
Duhsasana, even though there were elderly persons like Bhisma and Drona
present. She was a great devotee of Lord Krsna, and by her praying, the
Lord Himself became an unlimited garment to save her from the insult. A
demon of the name Jatasura kidnapped her, but her second husband
Bhimasena killed the demon and saved her. She saved the Pandavas from
the curse of Maharsi Durvasa by the grace of Lord Krsna. When the
Pandavas lived incognito in the palace of Virata, Kicaka was attracted by
her exquisite beauty, and by arrangement with Bhima the devil was killed
and she was saved. She was very much aggrieved when her five sons were
killed by Asvatthama. At the last stage, she accompanied her husband
Yudhisthira and others and fell on the way. The cause of her falling was
explained by Yudhisthira, but when Yudhisthira entered the heavenly
planet he saw Draupadi gloriously present there as the goddess of fortune
in the heavenly planet.

Subhadra: Daughter of Vasudeva and sister of Lord Sri Krsna. She was
not only a very dear daughter of Vasudeva, but also a very dear sister to
both Krsna and Baladeva. The two brothers and sister are represented in


--- Page 8 ---
668 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 13
the famous Jagannatha Temple of Purl, and the temple is still visited by
thousands of pilgrims daily. This temple is in remembrance of the Lord’s
visit at Kuruksetra during an occasion of solar eclipse and His subsequent
meeting with the residents of Vrndavana. The meeting of Radha and Krsna
during this occasion is-a very pathetic story, and Lord Sri Caitanya in the
ecstasy of Radharani always pined for Lord Sri Krsna at Jagannatha Puri.
While Arjuna was at Dvaraka, he wanted to have Subhadra ashis queen, and
he expressed his desire to Lord Krsna. Sri Krsna knew that His elder
brother, Lord Baladeva, was arranging her marriage elsewhere, and since He
did not dare to go against the arrangement of Baladeva, He advised Arjuna
to kidnap Subhadra. So when all of them were on a pleasure trip on the
Raivata Hill, Arjuna managed to kidnap Subhadra according to the plan of
Sri Krsna. Sri Baladeva was very angry at Arjuna, and He wanted to kill
him, but Lord Krsna implored His brother to excuse Arjuna. Then
Subhadra was duly married with Arjuna, and Abhimanyu was born of
Subhadra. At the premature death of Abhimanyu, Subhadra was very
mortified, but on the birth of Pariksit she was happy and solaced.

PURPORT
In the absence of consciousness, the limbs of the body remain inactive.
But when consciousness returns, the limbs and senses become active, and
existence itself becomes delightful. Vidura was so dear to the members of
the Kaurava family that his long absence from the palace was comparable
to inactivity. All of them were feeling acute separation from Vidura, and
therefore his return to the palace was joyful for all.

After Vidura ate sumptuously and took sufficient rest, he was com-

PURPORT
King Yudhisthira was expert in reception also, even in the case of his
family members. Vidura was well received by all the family members by
exchange of embraces and obeisances. After that, bathing and arrangements
for a sumptuous dinner were made, and then he was given sufficient rest.
After finishing his rest, he was offered a comfortable place to sit, and then
the King began to talk about all happenings, both family and otherwise.
That is the proper way to receive a beloved friend, or even an enemy.
According to Indian moral codes, even an enemy received at home should
be so well received that he will not feel any fearful situation. An enemy is
always afraid of his enemy, but this should not be so when he is received
at home by his enemy. This means that a person, when received at home,
should be treated as a relative, so what to speak of a family member like
Vidura, who was a well-wisher for all the members of the family. Thus
Yudhisthira Maharaja began to speak in the presence of all other members.

Maharaja Yudhisthira said: My uncle, do you remember how you

Your partiality, like wings of a bird, saved us from poisoning and arson.

PURPORT

Due to Pandu’s death at an early age, his minor children and widow were
the object of special care by all the elderly members of the family,
especially Bhismadeva and Mahatma Vidura. Vidura was more or less
partial to the Pandavas due to their political position. Although Dhrtarastra
was equally careful for the minor children of Maharaja Pandu, he was one
of the intriguing parties who wanted to wash away the descendants of
Pandu and replace them by raising his own sons to become the rulers of
the kingdom. Mahatma Vidura could follow this intrigue of Dhrtarastra
and company, and therefore, even though he was a faithful servitor of his
eldest brother Dhrtarastra, he did not like his political ambition for the
sake of his own sons. He was therefore very careful about the protection
of the Pandavas and their widow mother. Thus he was, so to speak, partial
to the Pandavas, preferring them to the sons of Dhrtarastra, although both
of them were equally affectionate in his ordinary eyes. He was equally
affectionate to both the camps of nephews in the sense that he always
chastised Duryodhana for his intriguing policy against his cousins. He
always criticized his elder brother for his policy of encouragement to his
sons, and at the same time he was always alert in giving special protection
to the Pandavas. All these different activities of Vidura within the palace
politics made him well-known as partial to the Pandavas. Maharaja
Yudhisthira has referred to the past history of Vidura before his going
away from home for a prolonged pilgrim’s journey. Maharaja Yudhisthira
reminded him that he was equally kind and partial to his grown-up
nephews, even after the Battle of Kuruksetra, a great family disaster.


--- Page 12 ---
672 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 13

Before the Battle of Kuruksetra, Dhrtarastra’s policy was peaceful
annihilation of his nephews, and therefore he ordered Purocana to build a
house at Varanavat, and when the building was finished Dhrtarastra desired
that his brother’s family live there for some time. When the Pandavas were
going there in the presence of all the members of the royal family,
Vidura tactfully gave instructions to the Pandavas about the future plan of
Dhrtarastra. This is specifically described in the Mahabharata (Ch.144 Adi-
parva). He indirectly hinted, “4 weapon not made of steel or any other
material element can be more than sharp to kill an enemy, and he who
knows this is never killed.” That is to say, he hinted that the party of the
Pandavas was being sent to Varanavat to be killed, and thus he warned
Yudhisthira to be very careful in their new residential palace. He also gave
indications of fire and said that fire cannot extinguish the soul, but it can
annihilate the material body. But one who protects the soul can live.
Kunti could not follow such indirect conversations between Maharaja
Yudhisthira and Vidura, and thus when she inquired from her son about
the purport of the conversation, Yudhisthira replied that from the talks of
Vidura it was understood that there was a hint of fire in the house where
they were proceeding. Later on, Vidura came in disguise to the Pandavas
and informed them that the housekeeper was going to set fire to the house
on the fourteenth night of the waning moon. It was an intrigue of
Dhrtarastra that the Pandavas might die all together with their mother.
And by his warning the Pandavas escaped through a tunnel underneath
the earth so that their escape was also unknown to Dhrtarastra, so much so
that after setting the fire, the Kauravas were so certain of the death of the
Pandavas that Dhrtarastra performed the last rites of death with great
cheerfulness. And during the mourning period all the members of the
palace became overwhelmed with lamentation, but Vidura did not become
so, because of his knowledge that the Pandavas were alive somewhere.
There are many such instances of calamities, and in each of them Vidura
gave protection to the Pandavas on one hand, and on the other he tried
to restrain his brother Dhrtarastra from such intriguing policies. Therefore,
he was always partial to the Pandavas, just as a bird protects its eggs by
his wing.

TRANSLATION
While traveling on the surface of the earth, how did you maintain

service?
PURPORT
Vidura went out from the palace to detach himself from household
affairs, especially political intrigues. As referred to hereinbefore, he was
practically insulted by Duryodhana’s calling him a son of a sidrani,
although it was not out of place to talk loosely in the case of one’s
grandmother. Vidura’s mother, although a siidrani, was the grandmother of
Duryodhana, and funny talks are sometimes allowed between grandmother
and grandchildren. But because the remark was an actual fact, it was
unpalatable talk for Vidura, and it was accepted as a direct insult. He
therefore decided to quit his paternal house and prepare for the renounced
order of life. This preparatory stage is called vanaprastha-asrama, or
retired life for traveling and visiting the holy places on the surface of the
earth. In the holy places of India, like Vrndavana, Hardvar, Jagannatha
Puri, Prayaga, etc., there are many great devotees, and there are still free
kitchen houses for persons who desire to advance spiritually. Maharaja
Yudhisthira was inquisitive to learn whether Vidura maintained himself
by the mercy of the free kitchen houses (chhatras).

everywhere, just as electricity power is distributed everywhere within
space. Similarly, the Lord’s omnipresence is perceived and manifested by
His unalloyed devotees like Vidura, just as electricity is manifested in an
electric bulb. A pure devotee like Vidura always feels the presence of the
Lord everywhere. He sees everything in the potency of the Lord and the
Lord in everything. The holy places all over the earth are meant for
purifying the polluted consciousness of the human being by an atmosphere
surcharged with the presence of the Lord’s unalloyed devotees. If anyone
visits a holy place, he must search out the pure devotees residing in such
holy places, take lessons from them, try to apply such instructions in
practical life and thus gradually prepare oneself for the ultimate salvation,
going back to Godhead. To go to some holy place of pilgrimage does not
mean only to take a bath in the Ganges or Yamuna or to visit the temples
situated in those places. One should also find out representatives of Vidura
who have no other desire in life save and except to serve the Personality of
Godhead. The Personality of Godhead is always with such pure devotees
because of their unalloyed service which is without any tinge of fruitive
action. They are in the actual service of the Lord specifically by the
process of hearing and chanting. The pure devotees hear from the authori-
ties and chant, sing and write of the glories of the Lord. Mahamuni
Vyasadeva heard from Narada, and then he chanted in writing; Sukadeva

Gosvami studied from his father, and he described it to Pariksit; that is the
way of Srimad-Bhagavatam. So by their actions the pure devotees of the
Lord can render any place into a place of pilgrimage, and the holy places
are worth the name only on their account. Such pure devotees are able to
rectify the polluted atmosphere of any place, and what to speak of a holy
place rendered unholy by the questionable actions of interested persons
who try to adopt a professional life at the cost of the reputation of a holy
place.

TRANSLATION
My uncle, you must have visited Dvaraka. In that holy place there are
our friends and well-wishers, the descendants of Yadu, who are always
rapt in the service of the Lord Sri Krsna. You might have seen them or
heard about them. Are they all living happily in their abodes?
PURPORT

The particular word Krsna-devatah, i.e., those who are always rapt in
the service of Lord Krsna, is significant. The Yadavas and the Pandavas,
who were always rapt in the thought of the Lord Krsna and His different
transcendental activities, were all pure devotees of the Lord like Vidura.
Vidura left home in order to devote himself completely to the service of
the Lord, but the Pandavas and the Yadavas were always rapt in the
thought of Lord Krsna. Thus there is no difference in their pure devotional


--- Page 16 ---
676 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 13
qualities. Either remaining at home or leaving home, the real qualification
of a pure devotee is to become rapt in the thought of Krsna favorably,
i.e., knowing well that Lord Krsna is the Absolute Personality of Godhead.
Karmhsa, Jarasandha, Sisupala and other demons like them were also always
rapt in the thought of Lord Krsna, but they were absorbed in a different
way, namely unfavorably, or thinking Him to be a powerful man only.
Therefore, Karhsa and Sisupala are not on the same level of pure devotees
like Vidura, the Pandavas or the Yadavas.

Maharaja Yudhigthira was also always rapt in the thought of Lord
Krsna and His associates at Dvaraka. Otherwise he would not have asked
all about them from Vidura. Maharaja Yudhisthira is, therefore, on the
same level of devotion as Vidura, although engaged in the state affairs of
the kingdom of the world.

Compassionate Mahitma Vidura could not stand to see the Pandavas

PURPORT
According to Niti-$astra (civic laws) one should not speak an unpalatable
truth to cause distress to others. Distress comes upon us in its own way by
the laws of nature, so one should not aggravate it by propaganda. For a
compassionate soul like Vidura, especially in his dealings with the beloved
Pandavas, it was almost impossible to disclose an unpalatable piece of news
like the annihilation of the Yadu dynasty. Therefore purposely he refrained
from it.

TRANSLATION
Thus Mahatma Vidura, being treated just like a godly person by his
kinsmen, remained there for a certain period just to pacify the mentality
of his eldest brother and in this way bring happiness to all the others.
PURPORT
Saintly persons like Vidura must be treated as well as a denizen from
heaven. In those days denizens of heavenly planets used to visit homes like
that of Maharaja Yudhisthira, and sometimes persons like Arjuna and
others used to visit higher planets. Narada is a spaceman who can travel
unrestrictedly, not only within the material universes but also in the
spiritual universes. Even Narada used to visit the palace of Maharaja
Yudhisthira and what to speak of other celestial demigods. It is only
the spiritual culture of the people concerned that makes interplanetary
travel possible, even in the present body. Maharaja Yudhisthira therefore
received Vidura in the manner of a reception offered to the demigods.
Mahatma Vidura had already adopted the renounced order of life, and
therefore he did not return to his paternal palace to enjoy some material
comforts. He accepted out of his own mercy what was offered to him by
Maharaja Yudhisthira, but the purpose of living in the palace was to deliver
his too much materially attached elder brother Dhrtarastra. Dhrtarastra
lost all his state and descendants in the fight with Maharaja Yudhisthira,
and still, due to his sense of helplessness, he did not feel ashamed to accept
the charity and hospitality of Maharaja Yudhisthira. On the part of Maha-
raja Yudhisthira, it was quite in order to maintain his uncle in a befitting
manner, but acceptance of such magnanimous hospitality by Dhrtarastra
was not at all desirable. He accepted it because he thought that there was
no other alternative. Vidura particularly came to enlighten Dhrtarastra
and to give him a lift to the higher status of spiritual cognition. It is the
duty of enlightened souls to deliver the fallen ones, and Vidura came for
that reason. But talks of spiritual enlightenment are so refreshing that
while instructing Dhrtarastra, Vidura attracted the attention of all the
members of the family, and all of them took pleasure in hearing him
patiently. This is the way of spiritual realization. The message should be
heard attentively, and if spoken by a realized soul, it will act on the dor-
mant heart of the conditioned soul. And by continuously hearing, one can
attain the perfect stage of self-realization.

TRANSLATION

As long as Vidura played the part of a sudra, being cursed by Manduka
Muni, Aryama officiated at the post of Yamaraja to punish those who
committed sinful acts.

PURPORT

Vidura, born in the womb of a siidra woman, was forbidden even to a
party of royal heritage along with his brothers Dhrtarastra and Pandu.
Then how could he occupy the post of a preacher to instruct such learned
kings and ksatriyas as Dhrtarastra and Maharaja Yudhisthira? The first
answer is that even though it is accepted that he was $idra by birth,
because he renounced the world for spiritual enlightenment by the authori-
ty of Rgi Maitreya and was thoroughly educated by him in transcendental
knowledge, he was quite competent to occupy the post of an acarya or
spiritual preceptor. According to Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, anyone who
is conversant in the transcendental knowledge or the science of Godhead,
be he a brahmana or a Sidra, a householder or a sannyasi, is eligible to
become a spiritual master. Even in the ordinary moral codes (maintained
by Canakya Pandit, the great politician and moralist) there is no harm in
taking lessons from a person who may be by birth less than a $iidra. This
is one part of the answer. The other is that Vidura was not actually a


--- Page 20 ---
680 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 13
sidra. He was to play the part of a so-called sidra for one hundred years,
being cursed by Manduka Muni. He was the incarnation of Yamaraja, one
of the twelve Mahdjanas on the level with such exalted personalities as
Brahma, Narada, Siva, Kapila, Bhisma, Prahlada, etc. Being a Mahajana, it
is the duty of Yamaraja to preach the cult of devotion to the people of
the world, as Narada, Brahma, and other Mahdjanas do. But Yamaraja is
always busy in his plutonic kingdom, punishing the doers of sinful acts.
Yamaraja is deputed by the Lord to a particular planet, some hundreds of
thousands of miles away from the planet of earth, to take away the
corrupt souls after death and convict them in accordance with their respec-
tive sinful activities. Thus Yamaraja has very little time to take leave from
his responsible office of punishing the wrongdoers. There are more wrong-
doers than righteous men. Therefore, Yamaraja has to do more work than
other demigods who are also authorized agents of the Supreme Lord. But
he wanted to preach the glories of the Lord, and therefore by the will of
the Lord he was cursed by Manduka Muni to come into the world in the
incarnation of Vidura and work very hard as a great devotee. Such a
devotee is neither a Sidra nor a brahmana. He is transcendental to such
divisions of mundane society, just as the Personality of Godhead assumes
His incarnation as a hog, but He is neither a hog nor a Brahma. He is above
all mundane creatures. The Lord and His different authorized devotees
sometimes have to play the role of many lower creatures to claim the
conditioned souls, but both the Lord and His pure devotees are always in
the transcendental position. When Yamarija thus incarnated himself as
Vidura, his post was officiated by Aryama, one of the many sons of
Kagyapa and Aditi. The Adityas are sons of Aditi, and there are twelve
Adityas. Aryama is one of the twelve Adityas, and therefore it was quite
possible for him to take charge of the office of Yamaraja during his ore
hundred years’ absence in the form of Vidura. The conclusion is that
Vidura was never a Sidra, but was greater than the purest type of
brahmana.

Having won his kingdom and observed the birth of one grandson com-
petent to continue the noble tradition of his family, Maharaja Yudhisthira
reigned peacefully and enjoyed uncommon opulence in cooperation with
his younger brothers, who were all expert administrators to the common
people.
PURPORT
Both Maharaja Yudhisthira and Arjuna were unhappy from the begin-
ning of the Battle of Kuruksetra, but even though they were unwilling to
kill their own men in the fight, it had to be done as a matter of duty, for it
was planned by the supreme will of Lord Sri Krsna. After the battle,
Maharaja Yudhisthira was unhappy over such mass killings. Practically
there were none to continue the Kuru dynasty after them, the Pandavas.
The only remaining hope was the child in the womb of his daughter-in-law,
Uttara, and he was also attacked by Aévatthama, but by the grace of the
Lord the child was saved. So after the settlement of all disturbing condi-
tions and reestablishment of the peaceful order of the state, and after
seeing the surviving child Pariksit well satisfied, Maharaja felt some relief
as a human being, although he had very little attraction for material
happiness, which is always illusory and temporary.

TRANSLATION

Insurmountable, eternal time imperceptibly overcomes those who are
too much attached to family affairs and are always engrossed in their
thought.

PURPORT

“I am now happy; I have everything in order; my bank balance is quite
enough; I can now give my children enough estate; I am now successful;
the poor beggar sannyasis depend on God, but they come to beg from me;
therefore I am more than the Supreme God, etc.” are some of the thoughts
which engross the insanely attached householder who is blind to the
passing of eternal time. Our duration of life is measured, and no one is able
to enhance it even by a second against the scheduled time ordained by the
supreme will. Such valuable time, especially for the human being, should
be cautiously spent because even a second passed away imperceptibly
cannot be replaced, even in exchange of thousands of golden coins
amassed by hard labor. Every second of human life is meant for making
an ultimate solution to the problems of life, i.e. repetition of birth and
death and revolving in the cycle of 8,400,000 different species of life.
The material body, which is subject to birth and death, diseases and old
age, is the cause of all sufferings of the living being, otherwise the living
being is eternal: he is never born, nor does he ever die. Foolish persons
forget this problem. They do not know at all how to solve the problems of
life, but become engrossed in temporary family affairs without knowing
that the eternal time is passing away imperceptibly, and their measured
duration of life is diminishing every second without any solution of the
big problem, namely repetition of birth and death, disease and old age.
This is called illusion.

But such illusion cannot work on one who is awake in devotional service
of the Lord. Yudhisthira Maharaja, or his brothers the Pandavas, were all
engaged in the service of the Lord Sri Krsna, and they had very little
attraction for the illusory happiness of this material world. As we have
discussed previously, Maharaja Yudhisthira was fixed up in the service of
the Lord Mukunda (the Lord who can award salvation), and therefore he
had no attraction even for such comforts of life as are available in the
kingdom of heaven, because even the happiness obtained in the planet of
Brahmaloka is also temporary and illusory. Because the living being is


--- Page 23 ---
Text 18] Dhrtaragtra Quits Home 683
eternal, he can be happy only in the eternal abode of the kingdom of God
(Paravyoma) from which no one returns to this region of repeated birth
and death, disease and old age. Therefore, any comforts of life or any
material happiness, which does not warrant an eternal life, are but illusion
for the eternal living being. One who understands this factually is learned,
and such a learned person can sacrifice any amount of material happiness
to achieve the desired goal known as brahma-sukham or absolute happi-
ness. Real transcendentalists are hungry for this happiness, and as a hungry
man cannot be made happy by all comforts of life minus foodstuff, so the
hungry man for eternal absolute happiness cannot be satisfied by any
amount of material happiness. Therefore, the instruction described in this
verse cannot be applied to Maharaja Yudhisthira or his brothers and
mother. It was meant for persons like Dhrtarastra, for whom Vidura came
especially to impart lessons.

Mahatma Vidura knew all this, and therefore he addressed Dhrtarastra,
saying: My dear King, please get out of here immediately. Do not delay.
Just see how fear has overtaken you.
PURPORT

Cruel death cares for none, be he Dhrtarastra or even Maharaja
Yudhisthira; therefore spiritual instruction, as was given to old Dhrtarastra,
was equally applicable to younger Maharaja Yudhisthira. As a matter of
fact, everyone in the royal palace including the King and his brothers and


--- Page 24 ---
684 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 13
mother was raptly attending the lectures. But it was known to Vidura
that his instructions were especially meant for Dhrtarastra, who was too
materialistic. The word rajan is especially addressed to Dhrtarastra signifi-
cantly. Dhrtarastra was the eldest son of his father, and therefore according
to law he was to be installed on the throne of Hastinapura. But because he
was blind from birth, he was disqualified from his rightful claim. But he
could not forget the bereavement, and his disappointment was somewhat
compensated after the death of Pandu, his younger brother. His younger
brother left behind him some minor children, and Dhrtarastra became the
natural guardian of them, but at heart he wanted to become the factual
King and hand over the kingdom to his own sons, headed by Duryodhana.
With all these imperial ambitions, Dhrtarastra wanted to become a king
and contrive all sorts of intrigues in consultation with his brother-in-law
Sakuni. But everything failed by the will of the Lord, and at the last
stage, even by losing everything, men and money, he wanted to remain as
King, being the eldest uncle of Maharaja Yudhisthira. Maharaja Yudhisthira,
as a matter of duty, maintained Dhrtarastra in royal honor, and Dhrtarastra
was happily passing away his numbered days in the illusion of becoming a
king or the royal uncle of King Yudhisthira. Vidura, as a saint and as the
duty-bound affectionate youngest brother of Dhrtaragtra, wanted to
awaken Dhrtarastra from his slumber of disease and old age. Vidura there-
fore sarcastically addressed Dhrtarastra as the “King,” which he was
actually not. Everyone is the servant of eternal time, and therefore no one
can be king in this material order. King means the person who can order.
The celebrated English King wanted to order time and tide, but the time
and tide refused to obey his order. Therefore one is a false king in the
material world, and Dhrtaragtra was particularly reminded of this false
position and of the factual fearful happenings which had already ap-
proached him at that time. Vidura asked him to get out immediately, if he
wanted to be saved from the fearful situation which was approaching
him fast. He did not ask Maharaja Yudhisthira in that way because he knew
that a king like Maharaja Yudhisthira is aware of all the fearful situations
of this flimsy world, and he would take care of himself,in due course, even
though Vidura might not be present at that time.

TRANSLATION

This rightful situation cannot be remedied by any person in this
material world. My lord, it is the Supreme Personality of Godhead as
eternal time [kala] that has approached us all.

PURPORT

There is no superior power which can check the cruel hands of death.
No one wants to die, however acute the source of bodily sufferings may
be. Even in the days of so-called scientific advancement of knowledge,
there is no remedial measure either for old age or for death. Old age is the
notice of the arrival of death served by cruel time, and no one can refuse
to accept either summon calls or the supreme judgment of eternal time.
This is explained before Dhrtaragtra because he might ask Vidura to find
out some remedial measure for the imminent fearful situation, as he
had ordered many times before. Before ordering, however, Vidura informed
Dhrtarastra that there was no remedial measure by anyone or from any
source in this material world. And because there is no such thing in the
material world, death is identical with the Supreme Personality of God-
head, as it is said by the Lord Himself in the Bhagavad-gita (Bg.12.32).

Death cannot be checked by anyone or from any source within this
material world. Hiranyakasipu wanted to be immortal and underwent a
severe type of penance by which the whole universe trembled, and Brahma
himself approached him to disuade Hiranyakasipu from such a severe type
of penance. Hiranyakasipu asked Brahma to award him the blessings of
immortality, but Brahma said that he himself was subject to death, even
in the topmost planet, so how could he award him the benediction of
immortality? So there is death even in the topmost planet of this universe,
and what to speak of other planets, which are far, far inferior in quality to


--- Page 26 ---
686 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 13
Brahmaloka, the residing planet of Brahma. Wherever there is the influence
of eternal time, there is this set of tribulations, namely birth, disease, old
age and death, and all of them are invincible.

Whoever is under the influence of supreme kala [eternal time] must

PURPORT
A great Indian scientist, busy in the planmaking business, was suddenly
called by invincible eternal time while going to attend a very important
meeting of the planning commission, and he had to surrender his life, wife,
children, house, land, wealth, etc. During the political upsurge in India
and its division into Pakistan and Hindusthan, so many rich and influen-
tial Indians had to surrender life, property and honor due to the influence
of time, and there are hundreds and thousands of examples like that all
over the world, all over the universe, which are all effects of the influence
of time. Therefore, the conclusion is that there is no powerful living being
within the universe who can overcome the influence of time. Many poets
have written verses on the influence of time, many devastations have
taken place over the universes due to the influence of time, and no one
could check them by any means. Even in our daily life, so many things

come and go in which we have no hand, but we have to suffer or tolerate
them without remedial measure. That is the result of time.

PURPORT
The King is reminded of his precarious condition, influenced by cruel
time, and by his past experience he should have been more intelligent to
see what was going to happen to his own life. His father Vicitravirya died
long ago, when he and his younger brothers were all little children, and it
was due to the care and kindness of Bhismadeva that they were properly
brought up. Then again his brother Pandu died also. Then in the Battlefield
of Kuruksetra his one hundred sons and his grandsons all died, along with
all other well-wishers like Bhismadeva, Dronacarya, Karna and many other
kings and friends. So he had lost all men and money, and now he was living
at the mercy of his nephew, whom ‘he had put into troubles of various
types. And despite all these reverses, he thought that he would prolong
his life more and more. Vidura wanted to point out to Dhrtarastra that
everyone has to protect himself by his action and the grace of the Lord.
One has to execute his duty faithfully depending for the result on the


--- Page 28 ---
688 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 13
supreme authority. No friend, no children, no father, no brother, no state
and no one else can protect a person who is not protected by the Supreme
Lord. One should, therefore, seek the protection of the Supreme Lord, for
the human form of life is meant for seeking that protection. He was warned
of his precarious conditions more and more by the following words.

You have been blind from your very birth, and recently you have

is disturbed. Your teeth are loose, your liver is defective, and you are
coughing up mucus.

PURPORT

The symptoms of old age, which had already developed in Dhrtarastra,
were all one after another pointed out to him as warning that death was
nearing very quickly, and still he was foolishly carefree about his future.
The signs pointed out by Vidura in the body of Dhrtarastra were signs
of apaksaya, or dwindling of the material body before the last stroke of
death. The body is born, it develops, stays, creates other bodies, dwindles
and then vanishes. But foolish men want to make a permanent settlement
of the perishable body and think that their estate, children, society,


--- Page 29 ---
Text 23] Dhrtarastra Quits Home 689
country, etc., will give them protection. With such foolish ideas, they be-
come overtaken by such temporary engagements and forget altogether
that they must give up this temporary body and take a new one again to
arrange for another term of society, friendship and love, again to be
perished ultimately. They forget their permanent identity and become
foolishly active for non-permanent occupations, forgetting altogether their
prime duty. Saints and sages like Vidura approach such foolish men to
awaken them to the real situation, but they take such sadhus and saints as
parasites of society, and almost all of them refuse to hear the words of such
sadhus and saints, although they welcome show bottle sadhus and so-called
saints who can satisfy their senses. Vidura is not a sadhu who satisfies the ill
gotten sentiment of Dhrtarastra. He was correctly pointing out the real
situation of life, and how one can save oneself from such catastrophies.

PURPORT

A sadhu should never flatter kings or rich men to live comfortably at

their cost. A sadhu is to speak to the householders about the naked truth

690 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 13
of life so that they may come to their senses about the precarious life in
material existence. Dhrtarastra is a typical example of an attached old
man in household life. He had become a pauper in the true sense, yet he
wanted to live comfortably in the house of the Pandavas, of whom Bhima
especially is mentioned because personally he killed two prominent sons
of Dhrtarastra, namely Duryodhana and Duhsasana. These two sons were
very much dear to him for their notorious and nefarious activities, and
Bhima is particularly pointed out because he killed these two pet sons.
Why was Dhrtarastra living there at the house of the Pandavas? Because
he wanted to continue his life comfortably, even at the risk of all humilia-
tion. Vidura, therefore, was astonished how powerful is the urge to con-
tinue life. This sense of continuing one’s life indicates that a living being
is eternally a living entity, and he does not want to change his bodily
habitation. The foolish man does not know that a particular term of
bodily existence is awarded to him to undergo a term of imprisonment,
and the human body is awarded, after many, many births and deaths, as a
chance for self-realization to go back home, back to Godhead. But persons
like Dhrtarastra try to make plans to live there in a comfortable position
with profit and interest, for they do not see things as they are. Dhrtarastra
is blind and continues to hope to live comfortably in the midst of all kinds
of reverses of life. A sadhu like Vidura is meant to awaken such blind
persons and thus help them go back to Godhead, where life is eternal.
Once going there, no one wants to come back to this material world of
miseries. We can just imagine how responsible a task is entrusted to a
sadhu like Mahatma Vidura.

TRANSLATION
There is no need to live a degraded life and subsist on the charity of
those whom you tried to kill by arson and poisoning. You also insulted
one of their wives and usurped their kingdom and wealth.
PURPORT
The system of varpasrama religion sets aside a part of one’s life com-
pletely for the purpose of self-realization and attainment of salvation in
the human form of life. That is a routine division of life, but persons
like Dhrtarastra, even at their weary ripened age, want to stay home, even in
a degraded condition of accepting charity from enemies. Vidura wanted to
point this out and impressed upon him that it was better to die like his
sons than accept such humiliating charity. Five thousand years ago there
was one Dhrtarastra, but at the present moment there are Dhrtarastras in
every home. Politicians especially do not retire from political activities
unless they are dragged by the cruel hand of death or killed by some
opposing element. To stick to family life up to the end of one’s human
life is the grossest type of degradation, and there is absolute need of
educating such Dhrtarastras by the Viduras, even at the present moment.

692 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 13
PURPORT
The words krpanasya jijivisoh are significant. There are two classes of
men. One is called the krpana, and the other is called the brahmana. The
krpana, or the miserly man, has no estimation of his material body, but the
brahmana has a true estimation of himself and the material body. The
krpana, having a wrong estimation of his material body, wants to enjoy
sense gratification with his utmost strength, and even in old age he wants
to become a young man by medical treatment or otherwise. Dhrtarastra
is addressed herein as a krpana because without any estimation of his
material body he wants to live at any cost, and Vidura is trying to open
his eyes to see that he cannot live more than his term and that he must
prepare for death. Since death is inevitable, why should he accept such a
humiliating position for living? It is better to take the right path, even at
the risk of death. Human life is meant for finishing all kinds of miseries of
material existence, and life should be so regulated that one can achieve the
desired goal. Dhrtarastra, due to his wrong conception of life, had already
spoiled eighty percent of his achieved energy, so it behooved him to
utilize the remaining days of his miserly life for the ultimate good. Such a
life is called miserly because one cannot properly utilize the assets of the
human form of life. Such a miserly man, by good luck only, meets a self-
realized soul like Vidura and by his instruction gets rid of the nescience of
material existence.

TRANSLATION
He is called undisturbed who goes to an unknown, remote place and,
freed from all obligations, quits his material body when it has become
useless.
PURPORT
Narottama Dasa Thakur, a great devotee and dcarya of the Gaudiya
Vaisnava sect, has sung: “My Lord, I have simply wasted my life. Having
obtained the human body, I have neglected to worship Your Lordship, and
therefore willingly I have drunk poison.” In other words, the human body
is especially meant for cultivating knowledge of devotional service of the
Lord, without which life becomes full of anxieties and miserable condi-
tions. Therefore, one who has spoiled his life without such cultural activi-
ties is advised to leave home without knowledge of friends and relatives
and, being thus freed from all obligations of family, society, country, etc.,
give up the body at some unknown destination so that others may not
know where and how he has met his death. Dhira means one who is not
disturbed, even when there is sufficient provocation. One cannot give up a
comfortable family life due to his affectionate relation with wife and
children. Self-realization is obstructed by such undue affection for family,
and if anyone is at all able to forget such a relation, he is called the un-
disturbed, or dhira. This is, however, the path of renunciation based on ४
frustrated life, but stabilization of such renunciation is possible only by
association with bona fide saints and self-realized souls by which 0110 can
be engaged in the loving devotional service of the Lord. Sincere surrender
unto the lotus feet of the Lord is possible by awakening the transcendental
sense of service, made possible by association of pure devotees of the Lord.
Dhrtarastra was lucky enough to have a brother whose very association was
a source of liberation for his frustrated life.

TRANSLATION
He is certainly a first-class man who awakens and understands, either
by himself or from others, the falsity and misery of this material world
and thus leaves home and depends fully on the Personality of Godhead
residing within his heart.
PURPORT
There are three classes of transcendentalists, namely, 1)the dhira, or the
one who is not disturbed by being away from the family association, 2)
one in the renounced order of life, asannyasi by frustrated sentiment,
and 3) a sincere devotee of the Lord, who awakens God consciousness by
hearing and chanting and leaves home depending completely on the Per-
sonality of Godhead who resides in his heart. The idea is that the renounced
order of life, after a frustrated life of sentiment in the material world, may
be the stepping stone on the path of self-realization, but real perfection of
the path of liberation is attained when one is practiced to depend fully on
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who lives in everyone’s heart as
Paramatma. One may live in the darkest jungle alone out of home, but a
steadfast devotee knows very well that he is not alone. The Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead is with him, and He can protect His sincere devotee in
any awkward circumstance. One should therefore practice devotional ser-
vice at home, hearing and chanting the holy name, quality, form, pastimes,
entourage, etc., in association with pure devotees, and this practice will
help one awaken God consciousness in proportion to one’s sincerity of
purpose. One who desires material benefit by such devotional activities
can never depend on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although He
sits in everyone’s heart. Nor does the Lord give any direction to persons
who worship Him for material gain. Such materialistic devotees may be
blessed by the Lord with material benefits, but they cannot reach the
stage of the first-class human being, as above mentioned. There are many
examples of such sincere devotees in the history of the world, especially

in India, and they are our guides on the path of self-realization. Mahatma
Vidura is one such great devotee of the Lord, and we should all try to
follow in his lotus footsteps for self-realization.

PURPORT

A life of frustration can be compensated by becoming 9 dhira, or leaving
home for good without communicating with relatives, and Vidura advised
his eldest brother to adopt this way without delay, because very quickly
the age of Kali was approaching. A conditioned soul is already degraded
by the material association, and still in the Kali-yuga the good qualities of
a man will deteriorate to the lowest standard. He was advised to leave
home before Kali-yuga approached because the atmosphere which was
created by Vidura, his valuable instructions on the facts of life, would fade
away due to the influence of the age which was fast approaching. To
become narottama, or a first-class human being depending completely on
the Supreme Lord Sri Krsna, is not pdssible for any ordinary man. It is
stated in the Bhagavad-gita (Bg. 7.28) that a person who is completely


--- Page 36 ---
696 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 13
relieved of all taints of sinful acts can alone depend on the Supreme Lord
Sri Krsna, the Personality of Godhead. Dhrtarastra was advised by Vidura
at least to become a dhira in the beginning if it were impossible for him to
become a sannydasi or a narottama. Persistently endeavoring on the line of
self-realization helps a person to rise to the conditions of a narottama from
the stage of a dhira. The dhira stage is attained after prolonged practice of
the yoga system, but by the grace of Vidura one can attain the stage
immediately simply by willing to adopt the means of the dhira stage,
which is the preparatory stage for sannyasa. The sannydsa stage is the
preparatory stage of paramaharisa, or the first-grade devotee of the Lord.

mediately left home to set out on the path of liberation, as directed by
his younger brother Vidura.
PURPORT

Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, the great preacher of the principles of
Srimad-Bhagavatam, has stressed the importance of associating with sadhus
or pure devotees of the Lord. He said that even by a moment’s association
with a pure devotee, one can achieve all perfection. We are not ashamed to
admit that this fact was experienced in our practical life. Were we not
favored by His Divine Grace Srimad Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami
Maharaja, by our first meeting for a few minutes only, it would have been
impossible for us to accept this mighty task of describing Srimad-
Bhagavatam in English. Without seeing him at that opportune moment,
we could have become a very great business magnate, but never would we
have been able to walk the path of liberation and be engaged in the factual
service of the Lord under instructions of His Divine Grace. And here is
another practical example by the action of Vidura’s association with
Dhrtarastra. Maharaja Dhrtarastra was tightly bound in a network of
material affinities related to politics, economy and family attachment, and
he did everything in his power to achieve so-called success in his planned
projects, but he was frustrated from the beginning to the end so far as his
material activities were concerned. And yet, despite his life of failure, he
achieved the greatest of all success in self-realization by the forceful in-
structions of a pure devotee of the Lord, who is the typical emblem of a
sadhu. The scriptures enjoin, therefore, that one should associate with
sadhus only, rejecting all other kinds of association, and by doing so one
will have ample opportunity to hear the sadhus who can cut to pieces the
bonds of illusory affection in the material world. It is a fact that the
material world is a great illusion because everything appears to be a
tangible reality, but the next moment everything is evaporated like the
dashing foam of the sea or a cloud in the sky. A cloud in the sky
undoubtedly appears to be a reality because it rains, and due to rains so
many temporary green things appear, but in the ultimate issue, everything
disappears, namely the cloud, rain and green vegetation, all in due course.
But the sky remains, and the varieties of sky or luminaries also remain
forever. Similarly the Absolute Truth, which is compared to the sky,
remains eternally, and the temporary cloudlike illusion comes and goes
away. Foolish living beings are attracted by the temporary cloud, but


--- Page 38 ---

intelligent men are more concerned with the eternal sky with all its
variegatedness.

the staff of the renounced order like fighters who have accepted a good

PURPORT
Saubalim or Gandhari, daughter of King Subala and wife of King
Dhrtarastra, was ideal as a devoted wife to her husband. The Vedic civili-
zation especially prepares chaste and devoted wives, of whom Gandhari is
one amongst many mentioned in history. Laksmiji Sitadevi was also a
daughter of a great king, but she followed her husband Lord Ramacandra
into the forest. Similarly, as a woman she could remain at home or at her
father’s house, but as a chaste and gentle lady she followed her husband


--- Page 39 ---
Text 31] Dhrtarastra Quits Home 699
without consideration. Instructions for the renounced order of life were
imparted to Dhrtarastra by Vidura, and Gandhari was by the side of her
husband. But he did not ask her to follow him because he was at that time
fully determined, like a great warrior who faces all kinds of dangers in the
battlefield. He was no longer attracted to so-called wife or relatives, and he
decided to start alone, but as a chaste lady Gandhar decided to follow her
husband till the last moment. Maharaja Dhrtarastra accepted the order of
vanaprastha, and at this stage the wife is allowed to remain as a voluntary
servitor, but in the sannydsa stage no wife can stay with her former hus-
band. A sannyasi is considered to be a dead man civilly, and therefore the
wife becomes a civil widow without connection with her former husband.
Maharaja Dhrtarastra did not deny his faithful wife, and she followed her
husband at her own risk.

The sannyasis accept a rod as the sign of the renounced order of life.
There are two types of sannydsis. Those who follow the Mayavadi philos-
ophy, headed by Sripada Sarikariciarya, accept only one rod (eka-danda),
but those who follow the Vaisnavite philosophy accept three combined
rods (tri-danda). The Mayavadi sannydsis are ekadandi-svamis, whereas the
Vaisnava sannydsis are known as tridapdi-svamis, or more distinctly,
tridandi gosvamis, in order to be distinguished from the Mayavadi philoso-
phers. The ekadapdi svamis are mostly fond of the Himalayas, but the
Vaisnava sannyasis are fond of Vrndavana and Purl. The Vaisnava sannydasis
are narottamas, whereas the Mayavadi sannyasis are dhiras. Maharaja
Dhrtarastra was advised to follow the dhiras because at that stage it was
difficult for him to become a narottama.

Maharaja Yudhisthira, whose enemy was never born, performed his
daily morning duties by praying, offering fire sacrifice to the sun-god, and
offering obeisances, grains, cows, land and gold to the brahmanas. He then
entered the palace to pay respects to the elderly. However, he could not
find his uncle and aunt, the daughter of King Subala.
PURPORT

Maharaja Yudhigthira was the most pious king because he personally
practiced daily the pious duties for the householders. The householders are
required to rise early in the morning, and after bathing, they should offer
respects to the Deities at home by prayers, by offering fuel in the sacred
fire, by giving the bréhmanas in charity land, cows, grains, gold, etc., and
at last offering to the elderly members due respects and obeisances. Unless
one is prepared to practice injunctions which are prescribed in the sastras,
one cannot be a good man simply by book knowledge. Modern house-
holders are practiced to different modes of life, namely to rise late and
then take bed tea without any sort of cleanliness and without any purifi-
catory practices as mentioned above. The household children are taken
to practice that which the parents practice, and therefore the whole
generation glides towards hell. Nothing good can be expected from them
unless they associate with sadhus. Like Dhrtarastra, the materialistic person
may take lessons from a sadhu like Vidura and thus be cleansed of the
effects of modern life.

Maharaja Yudhisthira, however, could not find in the palace his two
uncles, namely Dhrtarastra and Vidura, along with Gandhari, the daughter
of King Subala. He was anxious to see them and, therefore, asked Safijaya,
the private secretary of Dhrtarastra.

and, along with his wife, drown himself in the Ganges?
PURPORT
The Pandavas, especially Maharaja Yudhisthira and Arjuna, anticipated
the aftereffects of the Battle of Kuruksetra, and therefore Arjuna declined
to execute the fighting. The fight was executed by the will of the Lord,
but the effects of family aggrievement, as they thought of it before, had
come to be true. Maharaja Yudhisthira was always conscious of the great
plight of his uncle Dhrtarastra and aunt Gandhari, and therefore he took
all possible care of them in their old age and aggrieved conditions. When,
therefore, he could not find his uncle and aunt in the palace, naturally his
doubts arose, and he conjectured that they went down to the water of
the Ganges. He thought himself ungrateful because when the Pandavas
were fatherless, Maharaja Dhrtarastra gave them all royal facilities to live,
and in return he had killed all his sons in the Battle of Kuruksetra. As a
pious man, Maharaja Yudbisthira took into account all his unavoidable
misdeeds, and he never thought of the misdeeds of his uncle and company.
Dhrtarastra had suffered the effects of his own misdeeds by the will of the
Lord, but Maharaja Yudhisthira was only thinking of his own unavoidable
misdeeds. That is the nature of a good man and devotee of the Lord. A
devotee never finds fault with others, but tries to find out his own, and
thus rectify them as far as possible.

Safijaya was the personal assistant of Maharaja Yudhisthira for a very
long time, and thus he had the opportunity to study the life of Dhrtarastra.
And when he saw at last that Dhrtarastra had left home without his know-

ledge, even his sorrows had no bound. He was fully compassionate toward
Dhrtarastra because in the game of the Battle of Kuruksetra, King Dhrtar-
astra had lost everything, men and money, and at last the King and the
Queen had to leave home in utter frustration. He studied the situation in
his own way because he did not know that the inner vision of Dhrtarastra
was awakened by Vidura and that therefore he had left home in enthusi-
astic cheerfulness for a better life after departure from the dark well of
home. Unless one is convinced of a better life after renunciation of the
present life, one cannot stick to the renounced order of life simply by
artificial dress or staying out of the home.

TRANSLATION
Saiijaya said: My dear descendant of the Kuru dynasty, I have no
information of the determination of your two uncles and Gandhari. O
King, I have been cheated by those great souls.
PURPORT
That great souls cheat others may be astonishing to know, but it is a fact
that great souls cheat others for a great cause. It is said that Lord Krsna
also advised Yudhisthira to tell a lie before Dronacarya, and it was also for
a great cause. The Lord wanted it, and therefore it was a great cause.
Satisfaction of the Lord is the criterion of the bona fides, and the highest
perfection of life is to satisfy the Lord by one’s occupational duty. That
is the verdict of Gita and Bhagavatam.* Dhrtarastra and Vidura, followed
by Gandhari, did not disclose their determination to Safijaya, although he
was constantly with Dhrtarastra as his personal assistant. Safijaya never
thought that Dhrtarastra could perform any act without consulting him.
But Dhrtarastra’s going away from home was so confidential that it could
not even be disclosed to Safijaya. Sanatana Gosvami also cheated the
keeper of the prison house while going away to see Sri Caitanya Maha-
prabhu, and similarly Raghunatha Dasa Gosvami also cheated his priest
and left home for good to satisfy the Lord. To satisfy the Lord, anything
is good, for it is in relation with the Absolute Truth. We also had the same
opportunity to cheat the family members and leave home to engage in the
necessary for a great cause, and there is no loss for any party in such tran-
scendental fraud.

TRANSLATION
While Safijaya was thus speaking, Sri Narada, the powerful devotee of
the Lord, appeared on the scene. Maharaja Yudhisthira and his brothers re-
ceived him properly by getting up from their seats and offering obeisances.
PURPORT
Devarsi Narada is described herein as bhagavan due to his being the most
confidential devotee of the Lord. The Lord and His very confidential
devotees are treated on the same level by those who are actually engaged
in the loving service of the Lord. Such confidential devotees of the Lord
are very much dear to the Lord because they travel everywhere to preach
the glories of the Lord in different capacities and try their utmost to con-
vert the nondevotees of the Lord into devotees in order to bring them to
the platform of sanity. Actually a living being cannot be a nondevotee of
the Lord because of his constitutional position, but when one becomes a
nondevotee or nonbeliever, it is to be understood that the person concerned
is not in a sound condition of life. The confidential devotees of the Lord
treat such illusioned living beings, and therefore they are most pleasing in
the eyes of the Lord. The Lord says in the Bhagavad-gita that no one is
dearer to Him than one who actually preaches the glories of the Lord to
convert the nonbelievers and nondevotees. Such personalities as Narada
must be offered all due respects, like those offered to the Personality of
Godhead Himself, and Maharaja Yudhisthira, along with his noble brothers,
were examples for others in receiving a pure devotee of the Lord like
Narada, who had no other business save and except singing the glories of
the Lord along with his vind, a musical stringed instrument.

Maharaja Yudhisthira said: O godly personality, I do not know where
my two uncles have gone. Nor can I find my ascetic aunt who is grief-
stricken by the loss of all her sons.
PURPORT
Maharaja Yudhisthira, as a good soul and devotee of the Lord, was
always conscious of the great loss of his aunt and her sufferings as an
ascetic. An ascetic is never disturbed by all kinds of sufferings, and that
makes him strong and determined on the path of spiritual progress. Queen
Gandhari is a typical example of an ascetic by her marvelous character in
many trying situations. She was an ideal woman as mother, wife and
ascetic, and in the history of the world such character in a woman is rarely
found.

TRANSLATION
You are like a captain of a ship in a great ocean and you can direct us
to our destination. Thus addressed, the godly personality, Devarsi Narada,
greatest of the philosopher devotees, began to speak.
PURPORT
There are different types of philosophers, and the greatest of all of them
are those who have seen the Personality of Godhead and have surrendered
themselves in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Among all
such pure devotees of the Lord, Devarsi Narada is the chief, and therefore
he has been described herein as the greatest of all philosopher devotees.
Unless one is a sufficiently learned philosopher by hearing the Vedanta
philosophy from a bona fide spiritual master, one cannot be a learned
philosopher devotee. One must be very faithful, learned and re-
nounced, otherwise one cannot be a pure devotee. A pure devotee of the
Lord can give us direction towards the other end of nescience. Devarsi
Narada used to visit the palace of Maharaja Yudhisthira because the
Pandavas were all pure devotees of the Lord, and the Devarsi was always
ready to give them good counsel whenever needed.

Sri Narada said: O pious King, do not lament for anyone, for every-
one is under the control of the Supreme Lord. Therefore all living beings
and their leaders carry on worship to be well protected. It is He only who
brings them together and disperses them.

PURPORT

Every living being, either in this material world or in the spiritual world,
is under the control of the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead.
Beginning from Brahmaji, the leader of this universe, down to the insig-
nificant ant, all are abiding by the order of the Supreme Lord. Thus the
constitutional position of the living being is subordination under the
control of the Lord. The foolish living being, especially man, artificially
rebels against the law of the Supreme and thus becomes chastised as an
asiira or lawbreaker. A living being is placed in a particular position by the
order of the Supreme Lord, and he is again shifted from that place by the
order of the Supreme Lord or His authorized agents. Brahma, Siva, Indra,
Candra, Maharaja Yudhisthira or, in modern history, Napoleon, Akbar,
Alexander, Gandhi, Subhas or Nehru, all are servants of the Lord, and they
are placed in and removed from their respective positions by the supreme
will of the Lord. None of them is independent. Even though such men or
leaders rebel so as not to recognize the supremacy of the Lord, they are
put under still more rigorous laws of the material world by different
miseries. Only the foolish man, therefore, says that there is no God.
Maharaja Yudhisthira was being convinced of this naked truth because he
was greatly overwhelmed by the sudden departure of his old uncles and
aunt. Maharaja Dhrtarastra was placed in that position according to his
past deeds; he had already suffered or enjoyed the benefits accrued to him
in the past, but due to his good luck, somehow or other he got a good
younger brother, Vidura, and by his instruction he had left to achieve
salvation by closing all accounts in the material world.


--- Page 50 ---
710 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 13
Ordinarily no one can change the course of one’s due happiness and
distress by plan. Everyone has to accept them as they come under the
subtle arrangement of kala, or invincible time. There is no use trying to
counteract them. The best thing is, therefore, that one should endeavor
to achieve salvation, and this prerogative is given only to man because of
his developed condition of mental activities and intelligence. Only for
man are there different Vedic instructions for attainment of salvation
during the human form of existence. One who misuses this opportunity
of advanced intelligence is verily condemned and put into different types
of miseries, either in this present life or in the future. That is the way the
Supreme controls everyone.

TRANSLATION
As a cow, bound through the nose by a long rope, is conditioned,
so also human beings are bound by different Vedic injunctions and are
conditioned to obey the orders of the Supreme.
PURPORT
Every living being, whether a man or an animal or a bird, etc., thinks
that he is free by himself, but actually no one is free from the severe laws
of the Lord. The laws of the Lord are severe because they cannot be
disobeyed in any circumstance. The manmade laws may be evaded by
cunning outlaws, but in the codes of the supreme lawmaker, there is not the
slightest possibility of neglecting the laws. A slight change in the course of


--- Page 51 ---
Text 42] Dhrtarastra Quits Home 711
God-made law can bring about a massive danger to be faced by the
lawbreaker. Such laws of the Supreme are generally known as the codes of
religion under different conditions, but the principle ofreligion everywhere
is one and the same, namely, obey the orders of the Supreme God. (Codes
of Religion) That is the condition of material existence. All living beings
in the material world have taken up the risk of conditioned life by their
own selection and are thus entrapped by the laws of material nature. The
only way to get out of the entanglement is to agree to obey the Supreme.
But instead of becoming free from the clutches of maya or illusion, foolish
human beings become bound up by different nomenclatures, being desig-
nated as brahmanas, ksatriyas, vai§yas, $iadras, Hindus, Mussulmans,
Indians, Europeans, Americans, Chinese, and many others, and thus they
carry out the orders of the Supreme Lord under the influence of respective
scriptural or legislative injunctions. The statutory laws of the state are
imperfect imitation replicas or Religious Codes. The secular state, or the
godless state, allows the citizens to break the laws of God, but restricts
them from disobeying the laws of the state; the result is that the people
in general suffer more by breaking the laws of God than by obeying the
imperfect laws made by man. Every man is imperfect by constitution
under conditions of material existence, and there is not theleast possibility
of enacting a perfect legislation by the most materially advanced man. On
the other hand, there is no such imperfection in the laws of God. If they
are educated in the laws of God, there is no necessity of a makeshift
legislative council of aimless men. There is necessity of change in the
makeshift laws of man, but there is no change in the God-made laws
because they are made perfect by the all-perfect Personality of Godhead.
(Codes of Religion) Scriptural injunctions are made by liberated represent-
atives of God in consideration of different conditions of living, and by
carrying on the orders of the Lord gradually, the conditioned living beings
become free from the clutches of material existence. The factual position
of the living being is, however, that he is the eternal servitor of the
Supreme Lord. In his liberated state he renders service to the Lord in
transcendental love and thus enjoys a life of full freedom, even sometimes
on the equal level with the Lord or sometimes more than the Lord. But
in the conditioned material world, every living being wants to be the Lord
of other living beings, and thus by the illusion of maya such mentality of
lording it becomes a cause of further extension of conditional life. So
in the material world the living being is still more conditioned, until he
surrenders unto the Lord by reviving his original state of eternal servitor-
ship. That is the last instruction of the Bhagavad-gita and all other
recognized scriptures of the world.

TRANSLATION
As a player sets up and disperses his playthings according to his own
sweet will, so the supreme will of the Lord brings men together and
separates them.
PURPORT
We must know for certain that the particular position in which we are
now set up is an arrangement of the supreme will in terms of our own acts
in the past. The Supreme Lord is present as the localized Paramatma in the
heart of every living being, as it is said in the Bhagavad-gita (Bg. 13.22),
and therefore He knows everything of our activities in every stage of our
lives. The reactions of our actions are rewarded by Him by placing us in
some particular place. A rich man gets his son born with a silver spoon in
his mouth, but the child who came as the rich man’s son deserved such a
place, and therefore he is placed there by the will of the Lord. And at a
particular moment when the child has to be removed from that place, he
is also carried by the will of the Supreme, even if the child or the father
does not wish to be separated from the happy relation. The same thing
happens in the case of a poor man also. Neither rich man nor poor man has
any control over such meetings or separations of living beings. The example
of a player and his playthings should not be misunderstood. One may argue
that the Lord is bound to award the reactionary results of our own actions,
and thus the example of a player cannot be applied. But it is not so. We


--- Page 53 ---
Text 44] Dhrtarastra Quits Home 713
must always remember that the Lord is the supreme will, and He is not
bound by any law. Generally the law of karma is that one is awarded the
result of one’s own actions, but in special cases, by the will of the Lord,
such resultant actions are changed also. But this change can be effected by
the will of the Lord only, and no other. Therefore, the example of the
player cited in this verse is quite appropriate, for the Supreme Will is
absolutely free to do whatever He likes; and because He is all-perfect,
there is no mistake in any of His actions or reactions. These changes of
resultant actions are especially rendered by the Lord when a pure devotee
is involved. It is assured in the Bhaguvad-gita (Bg. 9.30-31) that the Lord
saves a pure devotee who has surrendered unto Him without reservation
from all sorts of reactions of sins, and there is no doubt about this. There
are hundreds of examples of this by the Lord in the history of the world.
If the Lord is able to change the resultant reactions of one’s past deeds,
then certainly He is not Himself bound up by any action or reaction of His
own deeds. He is perfect and transcendental to all laws.

illusory affection and nothing more.


--- Page 54 ---
714 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 13
PURPORT

The actual fact is that every living being is an individual part and parcel
of the Supreme Being, and his constitutional position is subordinate
cooperative service. Either in his conditional material existence or in his
liberated position of full knowledge and eternity, the living entity is
eternally under the control of the Supreme Lord. But those who are not
conversant with factual knowledge put forward many speculative proposi-
tions about the real position of the living entity. It is admitted, however,
by all schools of philosophy, that the living being is eternal and that the
covering body of five material elements is perishable and temporary.
The eternal living entity transmigrates from one material body to another
by the law of karma, and material bodies are perishable by their funda-
mental structures. Therefore there is nothing to be lamented in the case of
the soul’s being transferred into another body, or the material body
perishing at a certain stage. There are others also who believe in the
merging of the spirit soul in the Supreme Spirit when it is uncovered by
the material encagement, and there are others also who do not believe in
the existence of spirit or soul, but believe in tangible matter. In our daily
experience we find so many transformations of matter from one form to
another, but we do not lament such changing features. In either of the
above cases, the force of divine energy is uncheckable; no one has any
hand in it, and thus there is no cause of grief.

PURPORT
When we think of our kith and kin being helpless and dependent on us,
it is all due to ignorance. Every living creature is allowed all protection by
the order of the Supreme Lord in terms of each one’s acquired position in
the world. The Lord is known as bhiita-bhrt, one who gives protection to
all living beings. One should discharge his duties only; only the Supreme
Lord can give protection to anyone else. This is explained more clearly in
the following verse. ॥

TRANSLATION
This gross material body made of five elements is already under the
control of eternal time [kala], action [karma] and the modes of material
nature [guna]. How, then, can it, being already in the jaws of the serpent,
protect others?
PURPORT
The freedom movements of the world and political, economic, social,
and cultural propaganda can do no benefit to anyone due to their being
controlled by superior power. A conditioned living being is under the full
control of material nature represented by eternal time and activities under
the dictation of different modes of nature. There are three material modes
of nature, namely goodness, passion and ignorance. Unless one is situated
in the mode of goodness, one cannot see things as they are. The passionate
and the ignorant cannot even see things as they are. Therefore a person
who is passionate and ignorant cannot direct his activities on the right
path. Only the man in the quality of goodness can help to a certain extent.
Most persons are passionaté and ignorant, and therefore, their plans and
projects can hardly do any good to others. Above the modes of nature


--- Page 56 ---
716 Srimad-Bhiagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 13
there is eternal time, which is called kala because it changes the shape of
everything in the material world. Even if we are able to do something tem-
porarily beneficial, time will see that the good project is frustrated in course
of time. The only thing which is possible to be done is to get rid of the
eternal time, kala, which is compared to kala-sarpa, or the cobra snake
whose bite is always lethal. No one can be saved from the bite of a cobra.
The best remedy for getting out of the clutches of the cobralike kala or its
integrity, the modes of nature, is bhakti-yoga, as it is recommended in the
Bhagavad-gita (Bg. 14.26). The highest perfectional project of philanthropic
activities is to engage everyone in the act of preaching bhakti-yoga all over
the world because that alone can save the people from the control of maya
or the material nature represented by kala, karma and guna, as described
above. The Bhagavad-gita (Bg. 14.26) confirms this definitely.

Those who are devoid of hands are prey for those who have hands;
those devoid of legs are prey for the four-legged. The weak are the
subsistence of the strong, and the general rule holds that one living being
is food for another.
PURPORT
A systematic law of subsistence in the struggle for existence is there by
the supreme will, and there is no escape for anyone by any amount of
planning. The living beings who have come to the material world against
the will of the Supreme Being are under the control of a supreme power
called maya-sakti, the deputed agent of the Lord, and this daivi maya is


--- Page 57 ---
Text 47] Dhrtarastra Quits Home 717
meant to pinch the conditioned souls by threefold miseries, one of which
is explained here in this verse: the weak is the subsistence of the strong.
No one is strong enough to protect himself from the onslaught of a
stronger, and by the will of the Lord there are systematic categories of
the weak, the stronger and the strongest. There is nothing to be lamented
if a tiger eats a weaker animal, including a man, because that is the law of
the Supreme Lord. But although the law states that a human being must
subsist on another living being, there is the law of good sense also, for the
human being is meant to obey the laws of the scriptures also. This is
impossible for other animals. The human being is meant for self-realization,
and for that purpose he is not to eat anything which is not first offered
to the Lord. The Lord accepts from His devotee all kinds of food
preparations made of vegetable, namely fruits and leaves and grains. Fruits,
leaves and milk in different varieties can be offered to the Lord, and after
the Lord accepts the foodstuff, the devotee can partake of the prasadam
by which all sufferings in the struggle for existence will be gradually
mitigated. This is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita (Bg. 9.22). Even those
who are accustomed to eat animals can offer foodstuff, not to the Lord
directly, but to an agent of the Lord, under certain conditions of religious
rites. Injunctions of the scriptures are not meant to encourage the eaters
of animals, but to restrict them by regulated principles.

The living being is the source of subsistence for other stronger living
beings. No one should be very anxious for his subsistence in any circum-
stances because there are living beings everywhere, and no living being
starves for want of food at any place. Maharaja Yudhisthira is advised by
Narada not to worry about his uncles’ suffering for want of food, for
they could live on vegetables available in the jungles as prasadam of the
Supreme Lord and thus realize the path of salvation.

Exploitation of the weaker living being by the stronger is the natural
law of existence; there is always an attempt to devour the weak in different
kingdoms of the living being. There is no possibility of checking this
tendency by any artificial means under material conditions, but it can
only be checked by awakening the spiritual sense of the human being by
practice of spiritual regulations. The spiritual regulative principles, however,
do not allow a man to slaughter weaker animals on one side and teach
others peaceful coexistence. If man does not allow the animals peaceful
coexistence, how can he expect peaceful existence in human society?
The blind leaders must therefore understand the Supreme Being and then
try to implement the kingdom of God. The kingdom of God or Ramarajya
is impossible without the awakening of God consciousness in the mass
mind of the people of the world.

TRANSLATION
Therefore, O King, you should look to the Supreme Lord only, who
is one without a second and who manifests Himself by different energies
and is both within and without.
PURPORT
The Supreme Lord Personality of Godhead is one without a second, but
He manifests Himself by different energies because He is by nature blissful.
The living beings are also manifestations of His marginal energy, qualita-
tively one with the Lord, and there are innumerable living beings both
within and without the external and internal energies of the Lord. Since
the spiritual world is a manifestation of the Lord’s internal energy, the
living beings within that internal potency are qualitatively one with the
Lord without contamination from the external potency. Although
qualitatively one with the Lord, the living being, due to contamination of
the material world, is pervertedly manifested, and therefore he experiences
so-called happiness and distress in the material world. Such experiences
are all ephemeral and do not affect the spirit soul. The perception of such
ephemeral happiness and distress is due only to the forgetfulness of his
qualities, which are equal to the Lord’s. There is, however, a regular
current by which to rectify the fallen condition of the living being by the
Lord Himself from within and without. From within He corrects the
desiring living being as localized Paramatma, and from without He corrects
by His manifestations, the spiritual master and the revealed scriptures. One
should look unto the Lord; one should not be disturbed by the so-called


--- Page 59 ---
Text 49] Dhrtarastra Quits Home 719
manifestations of happiness or distress, but he should try to cooperate
with the Lord in His outward activities for correcting the fallen souls. By
His order only one should become a spiritual master and cooperate with
the Lord. One should not become a spiritual master for one’s personal
benefit or for some material gain or as an avenue of business or occupation
for earning livelihood. Bona fide spiritual masters who look unto the
Supreme Lord to cooperate with Him are actually qualitatively one with
the Lord, and the forgetful ones are perverted reflections only. Yudhisthira
Mahairija is advised, therefore, by Narada not to be disturbed with the
affairs of so-called happiness and distress, but to look only unto the Lord
to execute the mission for which the Lord has descended. That was his
prime duty.

TRANSLATION
That Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord Sri Krsna in the guise of
all devouring time [kala-riipa] has now descended on earth to eliminate
the envious from the world.
PURPORT

There are two classes of human beings, namely the envious and the
obedient. Since the Supreme Lord is one and the father of all living beings,
the envious living beings are also His sons, but they are known as the
asuras. But the living beings who are obedient to the Supreme Father are
called devatas, or demigods, because they are not contaminated by the
material conception of life. The asuras are not only envious of the Lord
in even denying the existence of the Lord, but they are also envious of all
otherliving beings. The predominance of asuras in the world is occasionally


--- Page 60 ---
720 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 13
rectified by the Lord when He eliminates them from the world and
establishes a rule of devatds like the Pandavas. His designation as kala in
disguise is significant. He is not at all dangerous, but He is the transcenden-
tal form of eternity, knowledge and bliss. For the devotees His factual
form is disclosed, and for the nondevotees He appears like kala-riipa
which is causal form. This causal form of the Lord is not at all pleasing to
the asuras, and therefore they think of the Lord as formless in order to
feel secure that they will not be vanquished by the Lord.

TRANSLATION
The Lord has already performed His duties to help the demigods, and
He is awaiting the rest. You Pandavas may wait as long as the Lord is here
on earth.
PURPORT

The Lord descends from His abode (Krsnaloka), the topmost planet
in the spiritual sky, in order to help the demigod administrators of
this material world when they are greatly vexed by the asuras, who are
not only envious of the Lord but also of His devotees. As referred to
above, the conditioned living beings contact material association by their
own choice, dictated by a strong desire to lord it over the resources of the
material world and become imitation lords of all they survey. Everyone is
trying to become an imitation God; there is keen competition amongst
such imitation gods, and such competitors are generally known as asuras.
When there are too many asuras in the world, then it becomes a hell for
those who are devotees of the Lord. Due to the growth of the asuras, the
mass of people who are generally devoted to the Lord by nature and the


--- Page 61 ---
Text 51] Dhrtarastra Quits Home 721
pure devotees of the Lord, including the demigods in higher planets, pray
to the Lord for relief, and the Lord either descends personally from His
abode or deputes some of his devotees to remodel the fallen condition of
human society, or even animal society. Such disruptions take place not
only in the human society but also amongst animals, birds or other living
beings, including the demigods in the higher planets. Lord Sri Krsna
descended personally to vanquish asuras like Karhsa, Jarasandha, Sigupala,
etc., and during the reign of Maharaja Yudhisthira almost all these asuras
were killed by the Lord. Now he was awaiting the annihilation of His own
dynasty, called the Yaduvarsa, who appeared by His will in this world.
He wanted to take them away before His own departure to His eternal
abode. Narada, like Vidura, did not disclose the imminent annihilation of
the Yadu dynasty, but indirectly gave a hint to the King and his brothers
to wait till the incident happens and the Lord departs.

completely from thoughts of familial affection.

PURPORT

The yoga system is a mechanical way to control the senses and the mind
and divert them from matter to spirit. The preliminary processes are the
sitting posture, meditation, spiritual thoughts, manipulation of air passing
within the body, and gradual situation in trance, facing the Absolute
Person Paramatma. Such mechanical ways of rising up to the spiritual
platform prescribe some regulative principles of taking bath daily three
times, fasting as far as possible, sitting and concentrating the mind on
spiritual matters and thus gradually becoming free from visaya or material
objectives. Material existence means to be absorbed in the material ob-
jective, which is simply illusory. House, country, family, society, children,
property, business, etc., are some of the material coverings of the spirit
atma, and the yoga system helps one to become free from all these
illusory thoughts and gradually turn towards the Absolute Person Param-
atma. By material association and education, we learn simply to concen-
trate on flimsy things, but yoga is the process of forgetting them altogether.
Modern so-called yogis and yoga systems manifest some magical feats, and
ignorant persons are attracted by such false things. or they accept the
yoga system as a cheap healing process for diseases of the gross body. But
factually the yoga system is the process of learning to forget what we have
acquired throughout the struggle for existence. Dhrtarastra was all along
engaged in improving family affairs by raising the standard of living of his
sons or by usurping the property of the Pandavas for the sake of his own
sons. These are common affairs for a man grossly materialistic and without
knowledge of the spiritual force. He does not see how this can drag one
from heaven to hell. By the grace of his younger brother Vidura, Dhrtar-
astra was enlightened and could see his grossly illusory engagements, and
by such enlightenment he was able to leave home for spiritual relaization.
प Naradadeva was just foretelling the way of his spiritual progress in a
place which was sanctified by the flow of the celestial Ganges. Drinking
water only without solid food is also considered fasting. This is necessary
for advancement of spiritual knowledge. A foolish man wants to be a
cheap yogi without observing the regulative principles. A man who has no
control over the tongue at first can hardly become a yogi. Yogi and bhogi
are two opposite terms. The bhogi or the merryman who eats and drinks
cannot be a yogi, for a yogi is never allowed to eat and drink unrestrictedly.
We may note with profit how Dhrtarastra began his yoga system by drink-
ing water only and sitting calmly in a place with a spiritual atmosphere,
deeply absorbed in the thoughts of the Lord Hari, the Personality of God-
head.

One who has controlled the sitting postures [the yogic asana] and

modes of material nature, namely mundane goodness, passion and ignor-
nee PURPORT
The preliminary activities of the way of yoga are dsana, pranayama,
pratyahara, dhyana, dharapd, etc. Maharija Dhrtarastra was to attain
success in those preliminary actions because he was seated in a sanctified
place and was concentrating upon one objective, namely the Supreme
Personality of Godhead (Hari). Thus all his senses were being engaged in
the service of the Lord. This process directly helps the devotee to get
freedom from the contaminations of the three material modes of nature.
Even the highest mode, the material mode of goodness, is also a cause of
material bondage, and what to speak of the other qualities, namely passion
and ignorance. Passion and ignorance increase the material propensities of
hankering for material enjoyment, and a strong sense of lust provokes the
accumulation of wealth and power. One who has conquered these two base
mentalities and has raised himself on the platform of goodness, which is
full of knowledge and morality, cannot also control the senses, namely the
eyes, the tongue, the nose, the ear and touch. But one who has surrendered
himself unto the lotus feet of Lord Hari, as above mentioned, can tran-
scend all influences of the modes of material nature and be fixed in the
service of the Lord. The bhakti-yoga process, therefore, directly applies
senses to the loving service of the Lord. This prohibits the performer from


--- Page 65 ---
Text 55] Dhrtarastra Quits Home 725
engaging in material activities. This process of turning the senses from
material attachment to the loving transcendental service of the Lord is
called pratyahara, and the very process is called pranayama, ultimately
ending in samadhi, or absorption in pleasing the Supreme Lord Hari by all
means. TEXT 55

TRANSLATION
Dhrtarastra will have to amalgamate his pure identity with intelligence
and then merge into the Supreme Being with knowledge of his qualitative
oneness, as a living entity, with the Supreme Brahman. Being freed from
the blocked sky, he will have to rise to the spiritual sky.
PURPORT

The living being, by his desiring to lord it over the material world and
declining to cooperate with the Supreme Lord, contacts the sum total of
the material world, namely the mahat-tattva, and from the mahat-tattva
his false identity, with the material world, intelligence, mind, and the
senses, is developed. This covers his pure spiritual identity. By the yogic
process, when his pure identity is realized, which is known as self-realiza-
tion, then one has to revert to the original position by amalgamating the
five gross elements and the subtle elements, mind and intelligence into the
mahat-tattva again. Thus getting freed from the clutches of the mahat-
tattva, he has to merge in the existence of the Supersoul. In other words,
he has to realize that qualitatively he is non-different from the Supersoul,
and thus he transcends the material sky by his pure identical intelligence
and thus becomes engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord.
This is the highest perfectional development of spiritual identity, which
was attained by Dhrtarastra by the grace of Vidura and the Lord. The


--- Page 66 ---
726 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 13
Lord’s mercy was bestowed upon him by his personal contact with Vidura,
and when he was actually practicing the instructions of Vidura, the Lord
helped him to attain the highest perfectional stage.

A pure devotee of the Lord does not live in any planet of the material
sky, nor does he feel any contact with material elements. His so-called
material body does not exist, being surcharged with the spiritual current
of the Lord’s identical interest, and thus he is permanently freed from all
contaminations of the sum total of the mahat-tattva. He is always in the
spiritual sky, which he attains by being transcendental to the sevenfold
material coverings by the effect of his devotional service. The conditioned
souls are within the coverings, whereas the liberated soul is far beyond the
cover.

material duties, he must become immovably established, beyond all sources
of hindrances on the path.
PURPORT

Dhrtarastra had attained, by the yogic process, the stage of negation of

all sorts of material reaction. The effects of the material modes of nature


--- Page 67 ---
Text 57] Dhrtarastra Quits Home 727
draw the victim to the indefatigable desires of enjoying matter, but one
can escape such false enjoyment by the yogic process. Every sense is
always busy in searching for its food, and thus the conditioned soul is
assaulted from all sides and has no chance to become steady in any pursuit.
Maharaja Yudhisthira was advised by Narada not to disturb his uncle by
attempting to bring him back home. He was now beyond the attraction
of anything material. The material modes of nature (the gunas) have their
different modes of activities, but above the material modes of nature
there is a spiritual mode also which is absolute. Nirguna means without
reaction. The spiritual mode and its effect are identical; therefore the
spiritual quality is distinguished from its material counterpart by the word
nirguna. After complete suspension of the material modes of nature, one is
admitted to the spiritual sphere, and action dictated by the spiritual modes
is called devotional service or bhakti. Bhakti is therefore nirguna attained
by direct contact with the Absolute.

his own mystic power, Dhrtarastra would not be in need of any funeral

burn to ashes. The perfection of the yoga system is attained by such mystic
power: the yogi 15 able to quit his body by his own choice of time and can

TRANSLATION
While outside observing her husband who will burn in the fire of
mystic power along with his thatched cottage, his chaste wife will enter
the fire with rapt attention.
PURPORT
Gandhari was an ideal chaste lady, a life companion of her husband, and
therefore when she saw her husband burning in the fire of mystic yoga
along with his cottage of leaves, she despaired. She left home after
losing her one hundred sons, and in the forest she saw that her most
beloved husband was also burning. Now she actually felt alone, and there-
fore entered the fire of her husband and followed her husband to death.
This entering of a chaste lady into the fire of her dead husband is called
the sati rite, and the action is considered to be most perfect for a woman.
In a later age, this sati rite became an obnoxious criminal affair because the
ceremony was forced upon even an unwilling woman. In this fallen age it
is not possible for any lady to follow the satirite as chastely as it was done
by Gandharl and others in past ages. A chaste wife like Gandhari would
feel the separation of her husband to be more burning than actual fire.
Such a lady can observe the sati rite voluntarily, and there is no criminal
force by anyone. When the rite became a formality only and force was
applied upon a lady to follow the principle, actually it became criminal,
and therefore the ceremony was to be stopped by state law. This prophecy
of Narada Muni to Maharaja Yudhisthira forbade him to go to his widow
aunt.

Vidura, being affected with delight and grief, will then leave that

PURPORT
Vidura was astonished to see the marvelous departure of his brother
Dhrtarastra as a liberated yogi, for in his past life he was much attached to
materialism. Of course it was only due to Vidura that his brother attained
the desirable goal of life. He was therefore glad to learn about it. But he
was sorry that he could not make his brother turn into a pure devotee.
This was not done by Vidura because of Dhrtarastra’s being inimical to the
Pandavas, who were all devotees of the Lord. An offense at the feet of a
Vaisnava is more dangerous than an offense at the lotus feet of the Lord.
Vidura was certainly very liberal to bestow mercy upon his brother
Dhrtarastra, whose past life was very materialistic. But ultimately the
result of such mercy certainly depended on the will of the Supreme Lord
in the present life; therefore Dhrtarastra attained liberation only, and
after many such liberated states of life one can attain to the stage of
devotional service. Vidura was certainly very mortified by the death of
his brother and sister-in-law, and the only remedy to mitigate such lamen-
tation was to go out to pilgrimage. Thus Maharaja Yudhisthira had no
chance to call back Vidura, his surviving uncle.

TRANSLATION
Having spoken thus, the great sage Narada, along with his vind,
ascended into outer space. Yudhisthira kept his instruction in his heart and
80 was able to get rid of all lamentations.
PURPORT

$n Naradaji is an eternal spaceman, having been endowed with a spiritual
body by the grace of the Lord. He can travel in the outer spaces of both
the material and spiritual worlds without restriction and can approach any
planets by mechanical means. Maharaja Yudhisthira was a pious king, and
his previous life as the son of a maidservant. Because of his association
with pure devotees, he was elevated to the position of an eternal spaceman
and thus had freedom of movement. One should therefore try to follow in
the footsteps of Narada Muni and not make a futile effort to reach other
planets by mechanical means. Maharaja Yudhisthira was a pious king, and
therefore he could see Narada Muni occasionally; anyone who desires to
see Narada Muni must first be pious and follow in the footsteps of Narada
Muni.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the First Canto, Thirteenth
Chapter, of Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “Dhrtardstra Quits Home.”

Sri Suta Gosvami said: Arjuna went to Dvaraka to see Lord Sri Krsna

and other friends and also to learn from the Lord of His next activities.
PURPORT

As stated in the Bhagavad-gita, the Lord descended on earth for the
protection of the faithful and annihilation of the impious, so after the
Battle of Kuruksetra and establishment of Maharaja Yudhisthira, the
mission of the Lord was complete. The Pandavas, especially ऽप Arjuna,
were eternal companions of the Lord, and therefore Arjuna went to
Dvaraka to hear from the Lord of His next program of work.

TRANSLATION
A few months passed, and Arjuna did not return. Maharaja Yudhisthira
then began to observe some inauspicious omens, which were fearful in
themselves.
PURPORT
Lord Sri Krsna the Supreme Personality of Godhead is ad infinitum,
more powerful than the most powerful sun of our experience. Millions
and billions of suns are created by Him and annihilated by Him within
His one breathing period. In the material world the sun is considered to be
the source of all productivity and material energy, and due to the sun only
we can have the necessities of life. Therefore, during the personal presence
of the Lord on the earth, all paraphernalia of our peace and prosperity,
especially religion and knowledge, were in full display because of the
Lord’s presence, just as there is a full flood of light in the presence of the
glowing sun. Maharaja Yudhisthira observed some discrepancies in his
kingdom, and therefore he became very anxious about Arjuna, who was
long absent, and there was also no news about Dvaraka’s well-being. He
suspected the disappearance of Lord Krsna, otherwise there would have
been no possibility of fearful omens.

ful; viparyastah—discrepancies; tu—but; dharmipah—specific function;
papiyasim—sinful; nrpam—of the human being; vartam—means of liveli-
hood; krodha—anger; lobha—greed; anrta—falsehood; atmanam—of the
people.

TRANSLATION

He saw that the direction of eternal time had changed, and this was
very fearful. There were disruptions in the seasonal regularities. The people
in general had become very greedy, angry and deceitful. And he saw that
they were adopting foul means of livelihood.

PURPORT

When civilization is disconnected from the loving relation of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, symptoms like changes of seasonal regulations,
foul means of livelihood, greed, anger and fraudulence become rampant.
The change of seasonal regulations refers to the atmosphere of one season
becoming manifest in another season, for example the rainy season being
transferred to autumn, or the fruits and flowers of one season fructifying
in another season. A godless man is invariably greedy, angry and fraudulent.
Such a man can earn his livelihood by any means, black or white. During
the reign of Maharaja Yudhisthira, all the above symptoms were conspicu-
ous by their absence. But Mahardja Yudhisthira was astonished 10 experi-
ence even a slight change in the godly atmosphere of his kingdom, and at
once he suspected the disappearance of the Lord. Foul means of livelihood
implies deviation from one’s occupational duty. There are prescribed duties
for everyone, such as the brahmana, ksatriya, vaiSya and $iidra, but any
one of them who deviates from his prescribed duty and declares another’s
duty to be his own is following a foul and improper duty. A man becomes
too greedy for wealth and power when he has no higher objective in life
and when he thinks that this earthly life of a few years is all in all.
Ignorance is the cause for all these anomalies in human society, and to
remove this ignorance, especially in this age of degradation, the powerful
sun is there to distribute light in the shape of Srimad-Bhdgavatam.

jihma-prayam—cheating; vyavahrtam—in all ordinary transactions;
sathya—duplicity; misram ca—adulterated in and; sauhrdam—regarding
friendly well-wishers; pitr— father; matr—regarding the mother; suhrt—well-
wishers; bhratr—one’s own brother; dampatinam—regarding husband and
wife; ca—also; kalkanam—mutual quarrel.

TRANSLATION

All ordinary transactions and dealings became polluted with cheating,
even between friends. And in familial affairs, there was always misunder-
standing between fathers and mothers and sons, and between well-wishers
and between brothers. Even between husband and wife there was always
strain and quarrel.

PURPORT

A conditioned living being is endowed with four principles of malprac-
tice, namely errors, insanity, inability and cheating. These are signs of
imperfection, and out of the four the propensity to cheat others is most
prominent. And this cheating practice is there in the conditioned souls
because the conditioned souls are primarily in the material world imbued
with an unnatural desire to lord it over the material world. A living being
in his pure state is not conditioned by the laws because in his pure state he
is conscious that a living being is eternally subservient to the Supreme
Being, and thus it is always good for him to remain subservient, instead of
falsely trying to lord it over the property of the Supreme Lord. In the
conditioned state the living being is not satisfied even if he actually
becomes the lord of all that he surveys, which he never becomes, and
therefore he becomes the victim of all kinds of cheating, even with his
nearest and most intimate relations. In such an unsatisfactory state of


--- Page 75 ---
Text 6] Disappearance of Lord Krsna 735
affairs, there is no harmony, even between father and sons or between
husband and wife. But all these contending difficulties can be mitigated
by one process, and that is devotional service of the Lord. The world of
hypocrisy can be checked only by counteraction of devotional service of
the Lord and nothing else. Mahardja Yudhisthira, having observed the
disparities, conjectured the disappearance of the Lord from the earth.

TRANSLATION
In course of time it came to pass that people in general became

these omens, spoke to his younger brother.
PURPORT
A pious king like Maharaja Yudhisthira at once became perturbed when
there were such inhuman symptoms as greed, anger, irreligiosity and
hypocrisy rampant in society. And it appears from this statement that all
these symptoms of degraded society were unknown to the people of the
time, and it was astonishing for them to have experienced them with the
advent of the Kali-yuga or the age of quarrel.

TRANSLATION ॥
Is He going to quit His earthly pastimes, as Devarsi Narada indicated?
Has that time already arrived?
PURPORT

As we have discussed many times, the Supreme Personality of Godhead
Lord Sri Krsna has many plenary expansions, and each and every one of
them, although equally powerful, executes different functions. In the
Bhagavad-gita there are different statements by the Lord, and each of
these statements is meant for different plenary portions or portions of the
plenary portions. For example, Sri Krsna the Lord says in the Bhagavad-gita:

“Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O

descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion—at that

time I descend Myself.” (Bg. 4.7)

“0 son of Kunti [Arjuna], I am the taste of water, the light of the sun

and the moon, the syllable om in the Vedic mantras; I am the sound in

ether and ability in man.” (Bg. 7.8)

“If 1 should cease to work, then all these worlds would be put to

ruination. I would also be the cause of creating unwanted population,

and I would thereby destroy the peace of all sentient beings.” (Bg. 3.24)


--- Page 78 ---
738 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 14
“Whatever action is performed by a great man, common men will follow
in his footsteps. And whatever standards he sets by exemplary acts, all
the world pursues.” (Bg. 3.21)

All the above statements of the Lord apply to different plenary portions
of the Lord, namely His expansions of Sankarsana, Vasudeva, Pradyumna,
Aniruddha, Narayana, etc. All these expansions are He Himself by different
transcendental expansions, and still the Lord as Sri Krsna functions in a
different sphere of transcendental exchange with different grades of
devotees. And yet Lord Krsna as He is appears once in the day of Brahma
(or after a lapse of 864 trillion solar years) in each and every universe, and
all His transcendental pastimes are displayed in each and every universe in
a routine spool. But in that routine spool the functions of Lord Krsna,
Lord Vasudeva, etc., are complex problems for the layman. There is no
difference between the Lord’s Self and the Lord’s transcendental body.
The expansions execute differential activities. When the Lord, however,
appears in His person as Lord Sri Krsna, His other plenary portions also
join in Him by His inconceivable potency called yogamaya, and thus the
Lord Krsna of Vrndavana is different from the Lord Krsna of Mathura or
the Lord Krsna of Dvaraka. The ৬১7৫0 ripa of Lord Krsna is also different
from Him, by His inconceivable potency. The virata rupa exhibited on the
Battlefield of Kuruksetra is the material conception of His form. Therefore
when Lord Krsna was apparently killed by the bow and arrow of the
hunter, it should be understood that the Lord left His so-called material
body in the material world. The Lord is kaivalya, and for Him there is no
difference between matter and spirit because everything is created from
Him. Therefore His quitting one sort of body or accepting another body
does not mean that He is like the ordinary living being. All such activities
are simultaneously one and different by His inconceivable potency. When
Maharaja Yudhisthira was lamenting the possibility of His disappearance,
it was just in pursuance of a custom of lamenting the disappearance of a
great friend, but factually the Lord never quits His transcendental body,
as is misconceived by less intelligent persons. Such less intelligent persons
have been condemned by the Lord Himself in the Bhagavad-gita, and they
are known as the mitdhas. That the Lord left His body means that He left
again His plenary portions in the respective dhamas (transcendental
abodes), as He left His virdta riipa in the material world.

TRANSLATION
From Him only, all our kingly opulence, our good wives, lives, pro-
geny, our control over our subjects, victory over our enemies and future
accomodations in higher planets, have become possible. All this is due to
His causeless mercy upon us.
PURPORT
Material prosperity consists of a good wife, good home, sufficient land,
good children, aristocratic family relations, victory over competitors and,
by pious work, attainment of accomodations in the higher celestial planets
for better facilities of material amenities. These facilities are earned not
only by one’s hard manual labor or by unfair means, but by the mercy of
the Supreme Lord. Prosperity earned by one’s personal endeavor also
depends on the mercy of the Lord. Personal labor must be there in addition
to the Lord’s benediction, but without the Lord’s benediction no one is
successful simply by personal labor. The modernized man of Kali-yuga
believes in personal endeavor and denies the benediction of the Supreme
Lord. Even a great sannydst of India delivered speeches in Chicago pro-
testing the benedictions of the Supreme Lord. But as far as Vedic $astras
are concerned, as we find in the pages of Srimad-Bhagavatam, the ultimate
sanction for all success rests in the hands of the Supreme Lord. Maharaja
Yudhisthira admits this truth in his personal success, and it behooves one to
follow in the footsteps of a great king and devotee of the Lord to make
life a full success. If one could achieve success without the sanction of the
Lord then no medical practitioner would fail to cure a patient. Despite the
most advanced treatment of a suffering patient by the most up-to-date
medical practitioner, there is death, and even in the most hopeless case,
without medical treatment, a patient is cured astonishingly. Therefore the


--- Page 80 ---
740 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 14
conclusion is that God’s sanction is theimmediate cause for all happenings,
good or bad. Any successful man should feel grateful to the Lord for all
he has achieved.

TRANSLATION
Just see, 0 man with a tiger's strength, how many miseries due to
celestial influences, earthly reactions and bodily pains—all very dangerous
in themselves—are forboding danger in the near future by deluding our
intelligence.
PURPORT

Material advancement of civilization means advancement of the reactions
of the threefold miseries due to celestial influence, earthly reactions and
bodily or mental pains. By the celestial influence of the stars there are
many calamities like excessive heat, cold, rains or no rains, and the after-
effects are famine, disease, and epidemic, and the aggregate result is agony
of the body and the mind. Man-made material science cannot do anything
to counteract all these threefold miseries. They are all punishments from
the superior energy of maya under the direction of the Supreme Lord.
Therefore our constant touch with the Lord by devotional service can give
us relief without being disturbed in the discharge of our human duties. The


--- Page 81 ---
Text 11] Disappearance of Lord Krsna 741
asuras, however, do not believe in the existence of God, and they make
their own plans to counteract all these threefold miseries, and so they meet
with failures every time. The Bhagavad-gita clearly states that the reaction
of material energy is never to be conquered because of the binding effects
of the three modes. They can simply be overcome by one who surrenders
fully in devotion under the lotus feet of the Lord. (Bg. 7.14)

TRANSLATION
The left side of my body, my thighs, arms and eyes are all quivering

undesirable happenings.
PURPORT
Material existence is full of undesirables. Things we do not want are
forced upon us by some superior energy, and we do not see that these
undesirables are under the grip of the three modes of material nature.
When a man’s eyes, arms and thighs all quiver constantly, one must know
that something is going to happen which is undesirable. These undesirables
are compared with fire in a forest.No one goes in the forest to set fire, but
fire automatically takes place in the forest, creating inconceivable calami-
ties for the living beings of the forest. Such fire cannot be extinguished by
any human efforts. The fire can only be extinguished by the mercy of the
Lord, who sends clouds to pour water on the forest. Similarly, undesirable


--- Page 82 ---
742 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 14
happenings in life cannot be checked by any number of plans. Such miser-
ies can be removed only by the mercy of the Lord, who sends His bona fide
representatives to enlighten human beings and thus save them from all
calamities.

Is Ugrasena happy? Are Hrdika and sons, Krtavarma, Akriira, Jayanta,
Gada, Sarapa and Satrujit, all happy? How is Balarama, the Personality of
Godhead and the protector of devotees?

PURPORT

Hastinapura, the capital of the Pandavas, was situated somewhere near
present New Delhi, and the kingdom of Ugrasena was situated in Mathura.
While returning to Delhi from Dvaraka, Arjuna must have visited the city
of Mathura, and therefore the inquiry about the King of Mathura is valid.
Amongst various names of the relatives, the name of Rama or Balarama,
eldest brother of Lord Krsna, is added with the word Personality of
Godhead because Lord Balarama is the immediate expansion of Visnu-
tattva as prakasa-vigraha of Lord Krsna. The Supreme Lord, although one
without a second, expands Himself as many other living beings. The Visnu-
tattva living beings are expansions of the Supreme Lord, and all of them are
qualitatively and quantitatively equal with the Lord. But expansions of
the jiva-$akti, the category of the ordinary living beings, are not at all equal
with the Lord. One who considers the jiva-$akti and the Visnu-tattva to be
on an equal level is considered a condemned soul of the world. Sri Rama
or Balarama is the protector of the devotees of the Lord. Baladeva acts as
the spiritual master of all devotees, and by His causeless mercy the fallen
souls are delivered. Sri Baladeva appeared as Sri Nityananda Prabhu during
the advent of Lord Caitanya, and the great Lord Nityananda Prabhu
exhibited His causeless mercy by delivering a pair of extremely fallen


--- Page 92 ---
752 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 14
souls, namely Jagai and Madhai. Therefore it is particularly mentioned
herein that Balarama is the protector of the devotees of the Lord. By His
divine grace only one can approach the Supreme Lord Sri Krsna, and thus
Sri Balarama is the mercy incarnation of the Lord, manifested as the
spiritual master, the savior of the pure devotees.

happy? And is Aniruddha, the plenary expansion of the Personality of

PURPORT
Pradyumna and Aniruddha are also expansions of the Personality of
Godhead, and thus They are also Visnu-tattva. At Dvaraka Lord Vasudeva
is engaged in His transcendental pastimes along with His plenary expan-
sions, namely Sarnkargana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha, and therefore each
and every one of Them can be addressed as the Personality of Godhead, as
it is mentioned in connection with the name Aniruddha.

TRANSLATION
Are all the chieftain sons of Lord Krsna, such as Susena, Carudesna,
Samba the son of Jambavati, Rsabha and all others, along with their sons,
all doing well?
PURPORT
As already mentioned, Lord Krsna had married 16,108 wives, and each
of them had ten sons. Therefore 16,108 x 10 = 161,080 sons. They all
grew up, and each of them had as many sons as their father, and the whole
aggregate was something near 1,610,800 family members of the Lord. The
Lord is the father of all living beings, who are countless in number; there-
fore only a few of them are called to associate with the Lord in His
transcendental pastimes as the Lord of Dvaraka on this earth. It is not
astonishing if the Lord maintained a visible family consisting of so many
members. It is better to refrain from comparing the Lord’s position
with ours, and it becomes a simple truth as soon as we understand
at least a partial calculation of the Lord’s transcendental position. King
Yudhisthira, while inquiring about the Lord’s sons and grandsons at
Dvaraka, mentioned only the chieftains amongst them, otherwise it was
impossible for him to remember all the names of the Lord’s family
members.

Also, are Uddhava and others, Nanda, Sunanda and other leaders of
liberated souls who are constant companions of the Lord, who are pro-

functions? Do they, who are all eternally bound in friendship with us,
remember our welfare?
PURPORT
The constant companions of Lord Krsna, such as Uddhava, etc., are all
liberated souls, and they had descended along with Lord Krsna on this
material world to fulfill the mission of the Lord. The Pandavas are also
liberated souls who descended along with Lord Krsna to serve Him in His
transcendental pastimes on this earth. As stated in the Bhagaved-gita
(Bg. 4.5), the Lord and His eternal associates, who are also liberated souls
like the Lord, come down on this earth at certain intervals. The Lord
remembers them all, but His associates, although liberated souls, forget
due to their being tatastha-sakti, or marginal potency of the Lord. That
is the difference between the Visnu-tattva and jiva-tattvas. The jiva-tattvas
are infinitesimal potential particles of the Lord, and therefore they require
the protection of the Lord at all times. And to the eternal servitors of the
Lord, the Lord is pleased to give all protection at all times. The liberated
souls never, therefore, think themselves as free as the Lord or as powerful


--- Page 95 ---
Text 34] Disappearance of Lord Krsna 755
as the Lord, but they always seek the protection of the Lord in all circum-
stances, both in the material world and in the spiritual world. This
dependence of the liberated soul is constitutional, just as sparks of a fire
can exhibit the glow of fire along with the fire and not independently.
Independently the glow of the sparks is extinguished, although the
quality of fire or the glowing is there. Thus those who give up the
protection of the Lord and become so-called lords themselves, out of
spiritual ignorance, come back again to this material world, even after
prolonged tapasya of the severest type. That is the verdict of all Vedic
literature.

TRANSLATION
Is Lord Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who gives
pleasure to the cows, senses and the brahmanas, who is very affectionate
towards His devotees, enjoying the pious assembly at Dvaraka Puri sur-
rounded by friends?
PURPORT

Here in this particular verse the Lord is described as Bhagavan, Govinda,
Brahmanya and Bhaktavatsala. He is Bhagavan svayam, or the original
Supreme Personality of Godhead full with all opulences, all power, all
knowledge, all beauty, all fame and all renunciation. No one is equal to or
greater than Him. He is Govinda because He is the pleasure of the cows
and the senses. Those who have purified their senses by devotional service
of the Lord can render unto Him real service and thereby derive transcen-


--- Page 96 ---
756 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 14
dental pleasure out of such purified senses. Only the impure conditioned
living being cannot derive any pleasure from the senses, but being illu-
sioned by false pleasures of the senses, he becomes servant of the senses.
Therefore, we need His protection for our own interest. The Lord is the
protector of cows and the brahminical culture. A society which is devoid
of cow protection and brahminical culture is not under the direct pro-
tection of the Lord, just as the prisoners in the jails are not under the
protection of the king but under the protection of a severe agent of the
king. Without cow protection and cultivation of the brahminical qualities
in human society, at least for a section of members of the society, no
human civilization can prosper at any length. By brahminical culture or
by developing the dormant qualities of goodness, namely truthfulness,
equanimity, sense control, forbearance, simplicity, general knowledge,
transcendental knowledge, and firm faith in the Vedic wisdom, one can
become a brahmana and thus see the Lord as He is. And after surpassing
the brahminical perfection, one has to become a devotee of the Lord so
that His loving affection in the form of proprietor, master, friend, son and
lover can be transcendentally achieved. The stage of a devotee, which
attracts the transcendental affection of the Lord, does not develop unless
one has developed the qualities of a brahmana as above mentioned. The
Lord is inclined to a brahmana of quality and not of false prestige. Those
who are less than a brahmana by qualification cannot establish any relation
with the Lord, just as fire cannot be kindled from the raw earth unless
there is wood, although there is a relation between wood and the earth.
Since the Lord is all-perfect in Himself, there could not be any question of
His welfare, and Maharaja Yudhisthira refrained from asking this question.
He simply inquired about His residential place, Dvaraka Puri, where pious
men assemble. The Lord stays only where pious men assemble and takes
pleasure in their glorifying the Supreme Truth. Maharaja Yudhisthira was
anxious to know about the pious men and their pious acts in the city of
Dvaraka.

The original Personality of Godhead, the enjoyer, and Balarama, the

the welfare, protection and general progress of the entire universe. And
the members of the Yadu dynasty, being protected by the arms of the
Lord, are enjoying life like the residents of the spiritual sky.
PURPORT
As we have discussed many times, the Personality of Godhead Visnu
resides within each and every universe in two capacities, namely as the
Garbhodakasayl Visnu and the Ksirodakasayl Visnu. The Ksirodakasay1
Visnu has His own planet on the northern top of the universe, and there
is a great ocean of milk where the Lord resides on the bed of the Ananta
incarnation of Baladeva. Thus Maharaja Yudhisthira has compared the
Yadu dynasty to the ocean of milk and Sri Balarama to the Ananta where
Lord Krsna resides. He has compared the citizens of Dvaraka to the liberated
inhabitants of the Vaikunthalokas. Beyond the material sky, further than
we can see with our eyes and beyond the sevenfold coverings of the
universe, there is the Causal Ocean in which all the universes are floating
like footballs, and beyond the Causal Ocean there is an unlimited span of


--- Page 98 ---
758 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 14
spiritual sky generally known as the effulgence of Brahman. Within this
effulgence there are innumerable spiritual planets, and they are known as
the Vaikuntha planets. Each and every Vaikuntha planet is many, many
times bigger than the biggest universe within the material world, and in
each of them there are innumerable prototypes of Visnu inhabitants who
look exactly like Lord Visnu. These inhabitants are known as the Maha-
paurugikas, or persons directly engaged in the service of the Lord. They
are happy in those planets and are without any kind of misery, and they
live perpetually in full youthfulness, enjoying life in full bliss and knowledge
without fear of birth, death, old age or disease, and without the influence
of kala, eternal time. Maharaja Yudhisthira has compared the inhabitants
of Dvaraka to the Mahapaurusikas of Vaikunthaloka because they are so
happy with the Lord. In the Bhagavad-gita there are many references to
the Vaikunthalokas, and they are mentioned there as Mad-dhama, or the
kingdom of the Lord.

all services, induced the Lord to conquer the demigods. Thus the queens
enjoy things which are prerogatives of the wives of the controller of
thunderbolts.

PURPORT

Satyabhama: One of the principal queens of Lord Sri Krsna at Dvaraka.
After killing Narakasura, Lord Krsna visited the palace of Narakasura
accompanied by Satyabhama. He went to Indraloka also with Satyabhama,
and she was received by Sacidevi, who introduced her to the mother of the
demigods, Aditi. Aditi was very much pleased with Satyabhama, and she
benedicted her with the blessings of permanent youth as long as Lord
Krsna remained on the earth. Aditi also took her with her to show her
the special prerogatives of the demigods in the heavenly planets. When she
saw the parijata flower, she desired to have it in her palace at Dvaraka.
After that, she came back to Dvaraka along with her husband and expressed
her willingness to have the parijata flower at her palace. Satyabhama’s
palace was especially bedecked with valuable jewels, and even in the
hottest season of summer the inside of the palace remained cool, as if
air-conditioned. She decorated her palace with various flags, heralding the
news of her great husband’s presence there. Once, along with her husband,
she met Draupadi, and she was anxious to be instructed by Draupadi in
the ways and means of pleasing her husband. Draupadi was expert in this
affair because she kept five husbands, the Pandavas, and all were very
much pleased with her. On receipt of Draupadi’s instructions, she was
very much pleased and offered her good wishes and returned back to
Dvaraka. She was the daughter of Satrujit. After the departure of Lord
Krsna, when Arjuna visited Dvaraka, all the queens, including Satyabhama
and Rukmini, lamented for the Lord with great feelings. At the last stage
of her life, she left for the forest to undergo severe penances.

Satyabhama instigated her husband to get the parijata flower from the
heavenly planets, and the Lord got it even by force from the demigods, as
a common husband secures things to please his wife. As already explained,
the Lord had very little to do with so many wives to carry out their
orders like an ordinary man. But because the queens accepted the high
quality of devotional service, namely administering the Lord all comforts,
the Lord played the part of a faithful complete husband. No earthly
creature can expect to have things from the heavenly kingdom, especially
the parijata flowers which are simply to be used by the demigods. But due
to their becoming the Lord’s faithful wives, all of them enjoyed the special


--- Page 100 ---
760 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 14
prerogatives of the great wives of the denizens of heaven. In other words,
since the Lord is the proprietor of everything within His creation, it is not
very astonishing for the queens of Dvaraka to have any rare thing from
any part of the universe.

TRANSLATION
The great heroes of the Yadu dynasty, being protected by the arms
of Lord Sri Krsna, always remain fearless in every respect. And therefore
their feet trample over the Sudharma assembly house, which the best
demigods deserved but which was taken away from them.
PURPORT
Those who are directly servitors of the Lord are not only protected by
the Lord from all fearfulness, but also enjoy the best of things, even if
they are forcibly accumulated. The Lord is equal in behavior to all living
beings, but He is partial to His pure devotees, being very affectionate
toward them. The city of Dvaraka was flourishing, being enriched with


--- Page 101 ---
Text 39] Disappearance of Lord Krsna 761
the best of things in the material world. The state assembly house is
constructed according to the dignity of the particular state. In the heavenly
planet, the state assembly house called Sudharma was deserving of the
dignity of the best of the demigods. Such an assembly house is never
meant for any state on the globe because the human being on the earth
is unable to construct it, however far a particular state may be materially
advanced. But during the time of Lord Krsna’s presence on the earth, the
members of the Yadu family forcibly brought the celestial assembly house
to earth and placed it at Dvaraka. They were able to use such force
because they were certain of the indulgence and protection of the Supreme
Lord Krsna. In other words, the Lord is provided with the best things in
the universe by His pure devotees. Lord Krsna was provided with all kinds
of comforts and facilities available within the universe by the members of
the Yadu dynasty, and in return such servitors of the Lord were protected
and fearless.

A forgetful conditioned soul is fearful. But a liberated soul is never
fearful, just as a small child completely dependent on the mercy of his
father is never fearful of anyone. Fearfulness is a sort of illusion for the
living being when he is in slumber and forgetting his eternal relation with
the Lord. Since the living being is never to die by his constitution, as
stated in the Bhagavad-gita (Bg. 2.20), then what is the cause of fearfulness?
A person may be fearful of a tiger in dream, but another man who is
awake by his side sees no tiger there. The tiger is a myth for both of them,
namely the person dreaming and the person awake, because actually there
is no tiger; but the man forgetful of his awakened life is fearful, whereas
the man who has not forgotten his position is not at all fearful. Thus the
members of Yadu dynasty were fully awake in their service of the Lord,
and therefore there was no tiger for them to be afraid of at any time.
Even if there were a real tiger, the Lord was there to protect them.

My brother Arjuna, please tell me whether your health is all right.
You appear to have lost your bodily luster. Is this due to others disrespect-
ing and neglecting you because of your long stay at Dvaraka?
PURPORT

From all angles of vision, the Maharaja inquired from Arjuna about the
welfare of Dvaraka, but he concluded at last that as long as Lord Sri Krsna
Himself was there, nothing inauspicious could happen. But at the same
time, Arjuna appeared to be bereft of his bodily luster, and thus he
inquired of his personal welfare and asked so many vital questions.

Text 41] Disappearance of Lord Krsna 763
PURPORT
A ksatriya or a rich man is sometimes visited by persons who are in
need of money. When they are asked for a donation, it is the duty of the
possessor of wealth to give in charity in consideration of the person,
place and time. If a ksatriya or a rich man fails to comply with this
obligation, he must be very sorry for this discrepancy. Similarly, one
should not fail to keep his promise to give in charity. These discrepancies
are sometimes causes of despondency, and thus failing, a person becomes
subjected to criticism, which might also be the cause of Arjuna’s plight.

You are always the protector of the deserving living beings, such as
brahmanas, children, cows, women and the diseased. Could you not give
them protection when they approached you for shelter?
PURPORT
The brahmanas, who are always engaged in researching knowledge for
the society’s welfare work, both materially and spiritually, deserve the
protection of the king in all respects. Similarly, the children of the state,
the cow, the diseased person, the woman and the old man specifically


--- Page 104 ---
764 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 14
require the protection of the state or a ksatriya king. If such living beings
do not get protection by the ksatriya, or the royal order, or by the state,
it is certainly shameful for the ksatriya or the state. Maharaja Yudhisthira
was anxious to know about this discrepancy on the part of Arjuna, if such
things had actually happened.

TRANSLATION
Have you contacted a woman of impeachable character, or have you
not properly treated a deserving woman? Or have you been defeated on
the way by someone who is inferior or equal to you?
PURPORT
It appears from this verse that during the time of the Pandavas free
contact between man and woman was allowed in certain conditions only.
The higher caste men, namely the brahmanas and ksatriyas, could accept
a woman of the vaiSya or the $8070 community, but a man from the lower
castes could not contact a woman of the higher caste. Even a ksatriya
could not contact a woman of the brahmana caste. The wife of a brahmana
is considered one of the seven mothers (namely one’s own mother, the
wife of the spiritual master or teacher, the wife of a brahmana, the wife of
a king, the cow, the nurse, and the earth). Such contact between man and
woman was known as uttama and adhama. Contact of a brahmana with a


--- Page 105 ---
Text 43] Disappearance of Lord Krsna 765
ksatriya woman is uttama, but the contact of a ksatriya with a woman of
a brihmana is adhama and therefore condemned. A woman approaching a
man for contact should never be refused, but at the same time the dis-
cretion as above mentioned may also be considered. Bhima was approached
by Hidimbi from a community lower than the $itdras, and Yayati refused
to marry the daughter of Sukracarya because of his being a brahmana.
Vyasadeva, a brahmana, was called to beget Pindu and Dhrtarastra.
Satyavatil belonged to a family of fishermen, but Parasara, a great brah-
mana, begot in her Vyasadeva. So there are so many examples of such
contacts with woman, but in all cases the contacts were not abominable
nor were the results of such contacts bad. Contact between man and
woman is natural, but that also must be carried out under regulated
principles so that social consecration may not be disturbed nor unwanted
worthless population be increased for the unrest of the world.

It is abominable for a ksatriya to be defeated by one who is inferior in
strength or equal in strength. If one is defeated at all, he should be de-
feated by some superior power. Arjuna was defeated by Bhismadeva, and
Lord Krsna saved him from the danger. This was not insult for Arjuna be-
cause Bhismadeva was far superior to Arjuna in all ways, namely age,
respect and strength. But Karna was equal to Arjuna, and therefore Arjuna
was in crisis when fighting with Karna. It was felt by Arjuna, and therefore
Karna was killed even by crooked means. Such are the engagements of
the ksatriyas, and Mahargja Yudhisthira inquired from his brother whether
anything undesirable happened on the way home from Dvaraka.

Have you not taken care of old men and boys who deserve to dine

committed some unpardonable mistake which is considered to be
abominable?
PURPORT
It is the duty of a householder to feed first of all the children and old
members of the family, the brahmanas and the invalids. Besides that, an
ideal householder is required to call for any unknown hungry man to come
and dine before he himself goes to take his meals. He is required to call
for such a hungry man thrice on the road. The neglect of this pre-
scribed duty of a householder, especially in the matter of the old men and
children, is unpardonable.

TRANSLATION
Or is it that you are feeling empty all the time because you might

can think of no other reason for you becoming so dejected.
PURPORT
All the inquisitiveness of Mahardja Yudhisthira about the world situa-
tion was already conjectured by Maharaja Yudhisthira on the basis of
Lord Krsna’s disappearance from the vision of the world, and this was now


--- Page 107 ---
Text 44] Disappearance of Lord Krsna 767
disclosed by him because of the acute dejection of Arjuna, which could
not have been possible otherwise. So even though he was doubtful about
it, he was obliged to inquire frankly from Arjuna on the basis of Sri
Narada’s indication.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports to the First Canto, Fourteenth
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “Disappearance of Lord
Krspa.”

therefore it was not possible for him to reply properly to the various
speculative inquiries of Maharaja Yudhisthira.

PURPORT
. The Supreme Living Being is perfect in all relations with His pure
devotee. 4 Arjuna is one of the typical pure devotees of the Lord
reciprocating in the fraternal relationship, and the Lord’s dealings with
Arjuna are displays of friendship of the highest perfect order. He was not
only a well-wisher of Arjuna, but also He was actually a benefactor, and to
make it still more perfect the Lord tied him into a family relationship by
arranging Subhadra’s marriage with him. And above all, the Lord agreed to
become a chariot driver of Arjuna in order to protect His friend from
warfare risks, and the Lord became actually happy when He established

the Pandavas to rule over the world. Arjuna remembered all these one
after another, and thus he became overwhelmed with such thoughts.

TRANSLATION
Arjuna said: O King! The Supreme Personality of Godhead Hari, who
treated me exactly like an intimate friend, has left me alone. Thus my
astounding power, which astonished even the demigods, is no longer with
me.
PURPORT
In the Bhagavad-gita (Bg. 10.41) the Lord says, “Anyone specifically
powerful and opulent in wealth, strength, beauty, knowledge and all that
is materially desirable is to be considered but a product of an insignificant
portion of the complete whole of My energy.” No one, therefore, can be
independently powerful in any measure without being endowed by the
Lord. When the Lord descends on the earth along with His eternal ever
liberated associates, He not only displays the divine energy possessed by
Himself, but He also empowers His associate devotees with the required


--- Page 112 ---
Text 6] The Pandavas Retire Timely 773
energy to execute His mission of incarnation. It is also stated in the
Bhagavad-gita, Fourth Chapter, that the Lord and His eternal associates
descend on the earth many times, but the Lord remembers all the different
roles of incarnations, whereas the associates, by His supreme will, forget
them. Similarly, the Lord takes away with Him all His associates when He
disappears from the earth. The power and energy which were bestowed
upon Arjuna were required for fulfillment of the mission of the Lord, but
when His mission was fulfilled, the emergency powers were withdrawn
from Arjuna because the astounding powers of Arjuna, which were aston-
ishing even to the denizens of heaven, were no longer required, and they
were now meant for going back home, back to Godhead. If endowment of
powers and withdrawal of powers by the Lord are possible even for a
great devotee like Arjuna, or even the demigods in heaven, then what to
speak of the ordinary living beings who are but figs compared to such
great souls. The lesson is, therefore, that no one should be puffed up for
his borrowed powers from the Lord. The sane man should rather feel
obliged to the Lord for such benefaction and must utilize such power for
the service of the Lord. Such power can be withdrawn at any time by the
Lord, so the best use of such power and opulence is to engage them in the
service of the Lord.

774 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 15
PURPORT
Factually for a living being there is no one dearer than the Lord. The
Lord expands Himself by innumerable parts and parcels as svarmsa and
vibhinnamsa. Paramatma is the svarmsa part of the Lord, whereas the
vibhinnamsa parts are the living beings. As the living being is the important
factor in the material body, or without the living being the material body
has no value, similarly without Paramatma the living being has no status
quo. Similarly, Brahman or Paramatma has no locus standi without the
Supreme Lord Sri Krsna. This is thoroughly explained in the Bhagavad-
gita (Bg. 15.18). They are all interlinked with one another or interdepend-
ent factors; thus in the ultimate issue the Lord is the summum bonum and
therefore the vital principle of everything.

Text 8] The Pandavas Retire Timely 775
PURPORT
Draupadi was the most beautiful daughter of King Drupada, and when
she was a young girl almost all the princes desired her hand. But Drupada
Maharaja decided to hand over his daughter to Arjuna only and therefore
contrived a peculiar way. There was a fish hanging on the inner roof of the
house under the protection of a wheel. The condition was that out of the
princely order, one must be able to pierce the fish’s eyes through the wheel
of protection, and no one would be allowed to look up at the target. On
the ground there was a water pot in which the target and wheel were
reflected, and one had to fix his aim towards the target by looking at the
trembling water in the pot. Maharaja Drupada well knew that only Arjuna
or alternately Karna could successfully carry out the plan. But still he
wanted to hand his daughter to Arjuna. And in the assembly of the
princely order, when Dhrstadyumna, the brother of Draupadi, introduced
all the princes to his grown-up sister, Karna was also present in the game.
But Draupadi tactfully avoided Karpa as the rival of Arjuna, and she
expressed her desire through her brother Dhrstadyumna that she was
unable to accept anyone who was less than a ksatriya. The vaisyas and the
Siidras are less important than the ksatriyas. Karna was known as a son of
a carpenter, who is a §iidra. So Draupadi avoided Karpa by this plea. When
Arjuna, in the dress of a poor brahmana, pierced the difficult target, every-
one was astonished, and all of them, especially Karna, offered a stiff fight
to Arjuna, but as usual by the grace of Lord Krsna he was able to emerge
very successful in the princely fight and thus gain the valuable hand of
Krsna,or Draupadi. Arjuna was lamentingly remembering the incidence in
the absence of the Lord by whose strength only he was so powerful.

TRANSLATION

Because He was near me, it was possible for me to conquer with
great dexterity the powerful King of heaven, Indradeva, along with his
demigod associates and thus enable the fire-god to devastate the Khandava
forest. And by His grace only the demon named Maya was saved from the
blazing Khandava forest, and thus we could build our assembly house of
wonderful architectural workmanship where all the princes assembled
during the performance of Rajasiiya-yajiia and paid you tributes.

PURPORT

The demon Mayadanava was an inhabitant of the forest Khandava, and
when the Khandava forest was set on fire, he asked protection from Arjuna.
Arjuna saved his life, and as a result of this the demon felt obliged. He
reciprocated by building a wonderful assembly house for the Pandavas,
which attracted the extraordinary attention of all state princes. They felt
the supernatural power of the Pandavas, and thus without grudge all of
them submitted and paid tributes to the Emperor. The demons possess
wonderful and supernatural powers to create material wonders. But they
are always disturbing elements of the society. The modern demons are the
harmful material scientists who create some material wonders for distur-
bance in the society. For example, the creation of the nuclear weapons
has caused some panic in the human society. Maya was also a materialist
like that, and he knew the art of creating wonderful things. And yet Lord
Krsna wanted to kill him. When he was chased both by the fire and the
wheel of Lord Krsna, he took shelter of a devotee like Arjuna, who saved
him from the wrath of the fire of Lord Sri Krsna. Devotees are therefore
more merciful than the Lord, and in devotional service the mercy of a
devotee is more valuable than the mercy of the Lord. Both the fire and

the Lord ceased from chasing the demon as soon as both of them saw that
the demon was given shelter by a devotee like Arjuna. The demon, feeling
obliged to Arjuna, wanted to do him some service to show his gratefulness,
but Arjuna declined to accept anything from him in exchange. Lord Sri
Krsna, however, being pleased with Maya for his taking shelter of a
devotee, asked him to render service unto King Yudhisthira by building a
wonderful assembly house. The process is that by the grace of the devotee
the mercy of the Lord is obtained, and by the mercy of the Lord a chance
to serve the Lord’s devotee is obtained. The club of Bhimasena was also a
gift of Mayadanava.

PURPORT

Jarasandha was a very powerful king of Magadha, and the history of his
birth and activities is also very interesting. His father, King Brhadratha,
was also a very prosperous and powerful King of Magadha, but he had no
son, although he married two daughters of the King of Kasi. Being dis-
appointed in not getting a son from either of the two queens, the King,
along with his wives, left home to live in the forest for austerities, but in
the forest he was benedicted by one great rsi to have a son, and he gave him
one mango to be eaten by the queens. The queens did so and were very
soon pregnant. The King was very happy to see the queens bearing
children, but when the ripe time approached, the queens delivered one
child in two parts, one from each of the queens’ wombs. The two parts
were thrown in the forest, where a great she-demon used to live, and she
was glad to have some delicate flesh and blood from the newly born child.
Out of curiosity she joined the two parts, and the child became complete
and regained life. The she-demon was known as Jara, and being compas-
sionate on the childless King, she went to the King and presented him with
the nice child. The King was very pleased with the she-demon and wanted
to reward her according to her desire. The she-demon expressed her
desire that the child be named after her, and thus the child was surnamed
Jarasandha, or one who was joined by Jara the she-demon. In fact, this
Jarasandha was born as one of the parts and parcels of the demon
Viprachitti. The saint by whose benediction the queens bore the child was
called Candra Kousik, who foretold of the child before his father
Brhadratha.

Since he possessed demoniacal qualities from birth, naturally he became
a great devotee of Lord Siva, who is the lord of all ghostly and demonic
men. Ravana was a great devotee of Lord Siva, and so also King Jarasandha.
He used to sacrifice all arrested kings before Lord Mahabhairava (Siva),
and by his military power he defeated many small kings and arrested them
to butcher before Mahabhairava. There are many devotees of Lord Maha-
bhairava or Kalabhairava in the province of Bihar, formerly called Magadha.
Jarasandha was a relative of Kamsa, the maternal uncle of Krsna, and
therefore after Kamsa’s death King Jarasandha became a great enemy of
Krsna, and there were many fights between Jarasandha and Krsna. Lord
Krsna wanted to kill him, but He also wanted that those who served as
military men for Jarasandha might not be killed. Therefore a plan was
adopted to kill him. Krsna, Bhima and Arjuna together went to Jarasandha
in the dress of poor brahmanas and begged charity from King Jarasandha.


--- Page 118 ---
Text 10] The Pandavas Retire Timely 779
Jarasandha never refused charity to any 07010770110, and he performed many
sacrifices also, yet he was not on a par with devotional service. Lord Krsna,
Bhima and Arjuna asked Jarasandha the facility of combating him, and it
was settled that Jarasandha would fight with Bhima only. So all of them
were both guests and combatants of Jarasandha, and Bhima and Jarasandha
fought every day for several days. Bhima became disappointed, but Krsna
gave him hints about Jarasandha’s being joined together as an infant, and
thus Bhima dissected him again and so killed him. All the kings who were
detained in the concentration camp to be killed before Mahabhairava were
thus released by Bhima. Feeling thus obliged to the Pandavas, they paid
tribute to King Yudhisthira.

Queen Draupadi had a beautiful bunch of hair which was sanctified in
the ceremonial function of Rajasiiya-yajiia. But when she was lost in the
bet, Duh$asana touched her glorified hair to insult her. Draupadi then fell
down at the lotus feet of Lord Krsna, and Lord Krsna decided that all the
wives of Duhsasana and company should have their hair loosened as a
result of the Battle of Kuruksetra. Thus after the Battle of Kuruksetra,
after all the sons and grandsons of Dhrtarastra died in battle, all the wives
of the family were obliged to loosen their hair as widows. In other words,
all the wives of the Kuru family became widows because of Duh$asana’s
insulting a great devotee of the Lord. The Lord can tolerate insults upon
Himself by any miscreant because the father tolerates even insults from
the son. But He never tolerates insults upon His devotees. By insulting a
great soul, one has to forego all the results of pious acts and benediction
also.

that time He [Lord Krsna], simply by accepting the remnants of food,
saved us. By His accepting food thus, the assembly of munis, while bathing
in the river, felt sumptuously fed. And all the three worlds were also
satisfied.

PURPORT

Durvasa Muni: A powerful mystic brahmana determined to observe the
principles of religion with great vows and under strict austerities. His name
is associated with many historical events, and it appears that the ig
mystic could be both easily satisfied and easily annoyed like Lord Siva.
When he was satisfied, hc could do tremendous good to the servitor, but if
he was dissatisfied he could bring about the greatest calamity. Kumari
Kunti, at her father’s house, used to minister all kinds of services to all
great brahmanas, and being satisfied with her good reception Durvasa
Muni benedicted her with a power to call any demigod she desired. It is
understood that he was a plenary incarnation of Lord Siva, and thus he
could easily be either satisfied or annoyed. He was a great devotee of Lord
Siva, and by his order he accepted the priesthood of King Svetaketu
because of the King’s performance of sacrifice for one hundred years.
Sometimes he used to visit the parliamentary assembly of the heavenly
kingdom of Indradeva. He could travel in space by his great mystic powers,
and it is understood that he travelled a great distance through space, even
up to the Vaikuntha planets beyond material space. He travelled all these
long distances within one year, during his quarrel with King Ambarisa, the
great devotee and Emperor of the world.

He had about ten thousand disciples, and wherever he visited and
became a guest of the great ksatriya kings, he used to be accompanied by
a number of followers. Once he visited the house of Duryodhana, the
enemy cousin of Maharaja Yudhisthira. Duryodhana was intelligent enough
to satisfy the brahmana by all means, and the great rsi wanted to give some
benediction to Duryodhana. Duryodhana knew his mystic powers, and he
knew also that the mystic brahmane, if dissatisfied, could cause some
havoc also, and thus he designed to engage the brahmana to show his
wrath upon his enemy cousins the Pandavas. When the rsi wanted to award
some benediction to Duryodhana, the latter wished that he should visit the
house of Maharaja Yudhisthira, who was the eldest and chief among all his
cousins. But by his request he would go to him after he had finished his
meals with his Queen, Draupadi. Duryodhana knew that after Draupadi’s
dinner it would be impossible for Maharaja Yudhisthira to receive such a
large number of brahmana guests, and thus the rsi would be annoyed and


--- Page 121 ---
782 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 15
would create some trouble for his cousin Maharaja Yudhisthira. That was
the plan of Duryodhana. Durvasa Muni agreed to this proposal, and he
approached the King in exile according to the plan of Duryodhana after
the King and Draupadi had finished their meals.

On his arrival at the door of Maharaja Yudhisthira, he was at once well
received, and the King requested him to finish his noontime religious rites
in the river and by that time the foodstuff would be prepared. Durvasa
Muni, along with his large number of disciples, went to take a bath in the
river, and Maharaja Yudhisthira was in great anxiety for the guests. As long
as Draupadi had not taken her meals, food could be served to any number
of guests, but the rsi, by the plan of Duryodhana, reached there after
Draupadi had finished her meals.

When the devotees are put into difficulty, they have an opportunity to
recollect the Lord with rapt attention. So Draupadi was thinking of Lord
Krsna in that dangerous position, and the all-pervading Lord could at once
know the dangerous position of His devotees. He therefore came there on
the scene and asked Draupadi to give whatever food she might have in her
stock. On her being so requested by the Lord, Draupadi was sorrowful
because the Supreme Lord asked her for some food and she was unable to
supply it at that time. She said to the Lord that the mysterious dish which
she had received from the sun-god could supply any amount of food if she
herself had not eaten. But on that day she had already taken her meals,
and thus they were in danger. By expressing her difficulties she began to
cry before the Lord as only a woman would do in such a position. The
Lord, however, asked Draupadi to bring up the cooking pots to see if there
was any particle of foodstuff left, and on Draupadi’s doing so, the Lord
found some particle of vegetable sticking to the pot. The Lord at once
picked it up and ate it. After doing so, the Lord asked Draupadi to call
for her guests, the company of Durvasa.

Bhima was sent to call them from the river. Bhima said, “Why are you
delaying, sirs? Come on, the food is ready for you.” But the brahmanas,
because of Lord Krsna’s accepting alittle particle of food, felt sumptuously
fed, even while they were in the water. They thought that since Maharaja
Yudhisthira must have prepared many valuable dishes for them and since
they were not hungry and could not eat, the King would feel sorry, so it
was better not to go there. Thus they decided to go away.

This incidence proves that the Lord is the greatest mystic, and therefore
He is known as yogesvara. Another instruction is that every householder
must offer food to the Lord, and the result will be that everyone, even a
company of guests numbering ten thousand, will be satisfied because of
the Lord’s being satisfied. That is the way of devotional service.

It was by His influence only that in a fight I was able to astonish the
Personality of God Lord Siva and his wife, the daughter of Mount Hima-
laya. Thus he [Lord Siva] became pleased with me and awarded me his
own weapon. Other demigods also delivered their respective weapons to
me, and in addition I was able to reach the heavenly planets in this present
body and was allowed a half-elevated seat.
PURPORT
By the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Sri Krsna, all other
demigods, including Lord Siva, were pleased with Arjuna. The idea is that
one who is favored by Lord Siva or any other demigod may not necessarily
be favored by the Supreme Lord Sri Krsna (Godhead). Ravana was cer-
tainly a great devotee of Lord Siva, but he could not be saved from the
wrath of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord Ramacandra. And
there are many instances like that in the histories of the Puranas. But here
is an instance where we can see that Lord Siva became pleased even in the


--- Page 123 ---
784 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 15
fight with Arjuna. The devotees of the Supreme Lord know how to respect
the demigods, but the devotees of the demigods sometimes foolishly think
that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is no greater than the demigods.
By such a conception, one becomes an offender and ultimately meets
with the same end as Ravana and others. The instances described by Arjuna
during his friendly dealings with Lord Sri Krsna are instructive for all who
may be convinced by the lessons that one can achieve all favors simply by
pleasing the Supreme Lord Sri Krsna while the devotees or the worshipers
of other demigods may achieve only partial benefits of life, which are also
perishable, just as the demigods themselves are.

Another significance of the present verse is that Arjuna, by the grace of
Lord Sri Krsna, was able to reach the heavenly planet even with the
selfsame body and was honored by the heavenly demigod Indradeva, being
seated with him half elevated. One can reach the heavenly planets by the
pious acts recommended in the $astras in the category of fruitive activities.
And as stated in the Bhagavad-gita (Bg. 9.21), when the reactions of such
pious acts are spent, the enjoyer is again degraded to this earthly planet.
The moon is also on the level with the heavenly planets, and only persons
who have performed virtues only, namely performing sacrifices, giving
in charity and undergoing severe austerities, etc., can be allowed to enter
into the heavenly planets after the duration of life of the body. Arjuna
was allowed to enter into the heavenly planets in the selfsame body simply
by the grace of the Lord, otherwise it is not possible to do so. The present
attempts to enter into the heavenly planets by the modern scientists will
certainly prove futile because such scientists are not on the level of Arjuna.
They are ordinary human beings without any assets of sacrifice, charity or
austerities. The material body is influenced by the three modes of material
nature, namely goodness, passion and ignorance. The present population
is more or less influenced by the modes of passion and ignorance, and the
symptoms for such influence are exhibited in their becoming very lusty
and greedy. Such degraded fellows can hardly approach the higher plan-
etary systems. Above the heavenly planets there are many other planets
also, which only those who are influenced by goodness can reach. In
heavenly and other planets within the universe, the inhabitants are all
highly intelligent, many more times than the human beings, and they are
all pious in the higher and the highest mode of goodness. They are all
devotees of the Lord, and although their goodness is not unadulterated,
still they arc known as demigods possessing the maximum amount of good
qualities possible within the material world. त

I was so powerful.
PURPORT
The heavenly demigods are certainly more intelligent, powerful and
beautiful, and yet they had to take help from Arjuna because of his
Gangdiva bow, which was empowered by the grace of Lord Sri Krsna. The
Lord is all-powerful, and by His grace His pure devotee also can be as

The military strength of the Kauravas was like an ocean in which
there dwelled many invincible existences, and thus it was insurmountable.
But because of His friendship, I, seated on the chariot, was able to cross
over it. And only by His grace was I able to regain the cows and also
collect by force many helmets of the kings which were bedecked with
jewels that were sources of all brilliance.
PURPORT
On the Kaurava side there were many stalwart commanders like Bhisma,
Drona, Krpa and Karna, and their military strength was as insurmountable
as the great ocean. And yet it was due to Lord Krsna’s grace that Arjuna
alone, sitting on the chariot, could manage to vanquish them one after

another without difficulty. There were many changes of commanders on
the other side, but on the Pandavas’ side Arjuna alone on the chariot
driven by Lord Krsna could manage the whole responsibility of the great
war. Similarly, when the Pandavas were living at the palace of Virata
incognito, the Kauravas picked a quarrel with King Virata and decided to
take away his large number of cows. Thus while taking away the cows,
Arjuna fought with them incognito and was able to regain the cows along
with some booty taken by force, the jewels set on the turbans of the royal
order. Arjuna remembered that all this was possible by the grace of the
Lord.

more than adequate, but He [Lord Sri Krsna], while going forward, did
all this.


--- Page 127 ---
788 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 15
PURPORT
The Absolute Personality of Godhead Lord Sri Krsna by His plenary
Paramatma portion expands Himself in everyone’s heart, and thus He
directs everyone in the matter of recollection, forgetfulness, knowledge,
the absence of intelligence and all psychological activities (Bg. 15.15). As
the Supreme Lord, He can increase or decrease the duration of life of a
living being. Thus the Lord conducted the Battle of Kuruksetra according
to His own plan. He wanted that battle to establish Yudhisthira as the
Emperor of this planet, and to facilitate this transcendental business He
killed all who were on the opposite party by His omnipotent will. The
other party was equipped with all military strength supported by big
generals like Bhisma, Drona, Salya, etc., and it would have been physically
impossible for Arjuna to win the battle had the Lord not helped him by
every kind of tactic. Such tactics are generally followed by every statesman,
even in modern warfare, but they are all done materially by powerful
espionages, military tactics and diplomatic maneuvers. But because Arjuna
was the Lord’s affectionate devotee, the Lord did all this Himself without
personal anxiety by Arjuna. That is the way of devotional service of the
Lord.

TRANSLATION

Great generals like Bhisma, Drona, Karna, Bhiirisrava, Sudarma, Salya,
Jayadratha, Bahlika, etc., all directed their invincible weapons against me.
But by His [Lord Krsna’s] grace they could not even touch a hair of my
head. Similarly, Prahlada Maharaja, the supreme devotee of Lord Nrsimha-
deva, was unaffected by the weapons the demons used against him.

PURPORT

The history of Prahlada Maharaja, the great devotee of Nrsirhhadeva, is
narrated in the Seventh Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam. Prahlada Maharaja,
a small child of five years only, became the object of envy of his great
father Hiranyakasipu only for his son’s becoming a pure devotee of the
Lord. The demon father applied all his weapons to kill the devotee son
Prahlada, but by the grace of the Lord he was saved from all sorts of
dangerous actions by his father. He was thrown in a fire, in boiling
oil, from the top of a hill, underneath the legs of an elephant, and was
administered poison. At last the father himself took up a chopper to kill
his son, and thus Nrsirhhadeva appeared and killed the heinous father before
the son. Thus no one can kill the devotee of the Lord. Similarly, Arjuna
was also saved by the Lord, although all dangerous weapons were applied
by his great opponents like Bhisma.

Karpa: Born of Kunti by the sun-god prior to her marriage with
Maharaja Pandu. Karna took his birth with bangles and earrings, extra-
ordinary signs for an undaunted hero. In the beginning his name was
Vasusena, but when he grew up he presented his natural bangles and
earrings to Indradeva, and thenceforward he became known as Vaikartan.
After his birth from maiden Kunti, he was thrown in the Ganges. Later he
was picked up by Adhirat, and he and his wife Radha brought him up as
their own offspring. Karna was very charitable, especially toward the
brahmanas. There was nothing which he could not spare for a brahmana.
In the same charitable spirit he gave in charity his natural bangles and
earrings to Indradeva, who, being very much satisfied with him, gave him
in return a great weapon called Sakti. He was admitted as one of the
students of Dronacarya, and from the very beginning there was some
rivalry between him and Arjuna. Seeing his constant rivalry with Arjuna,


--- Page 129 ---
790 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 15
Duryodhana picked him up as his companion, and this gradually grew
into greater intimacy. He was also present in the great assembly of
Draupadr’s svayarvara function, and when he attempted to exhibit his
talent in that meeting, Draupadi’s brother declared that Karna could not
take part in the competition because of his being the son of a Sidra
carpenter. Although he was refused in the competition, still when Arjuna
was successful in piercing the fish target on the ceiling and Draupadi
bestowed her garland to Arjuna, Karna and other disappointed princes
offered an unusual stumbling block to Arjuna while he was leaving with
Draupadi. Specifically Karna fought with him very valiantly, but all of
them were defeated by Arjuna. Duryodhana was very much pleased with
Karna because of his constant rivalry with Arjuna, and when he was in
power, he enthroned Karna in the state of Anga. Being baffled in his
attempt to win Draupadi, he advised Duryodhana to attack King Drupada,
for after defeating him both Arjuna and Draupadi could be arrested. But
Dronacarya rebuked them for this conspiracy, and they refrained from the
action. Karna was defeated many times, not only by Arjuna but also by
Bhimasena. He was the King of the kingdom of Bengal, Orissa and Madras
combined. Later on he took an active part in the Rajasiiya sacrifice of
Mahardja Yudhisthira, and when there was gambling between the rival
brothers, designed by Sakuni, Karna took part in the game, and he was
very pleased when Draupadi was offered as a bet in the gambling. This fed
his old grudge. When Draupadi was in the game he was very enthusiastic
to declare the news, and it is he who ordered Duhédsana to take away the
garments of both the Pandavas and Draupadi. He asked Draupadi to select
another husband because, being lost by the Pandavas, she was rendered a
slave of the Kurus. He was always an enemy of the Pandavas, and whenever
there was an opportunity, he tried to curb them by all means. During the
Battle of Kuruksetra, he foresaw the conclusive result, and he expressed
his opinion that due to Lord Krsna’s being the chariot driver of Arjuna,
the battle should be won by him. He always differed with Bhisma, and
sometimes he was proud enough to say that within five days he could
finish up the Pandavas, if Bhisma would not interfere with his plan of
action. But he was much mortified when Bhisma died. He killed Ghatotkach
with the Sakti weapon obtained from Indradeva. His son, Brisasena, was
killed by Arjuna. He killed the largest number of Pandava soldiers. At last
there was a severe fight with Arjuna, and it is he only who was able to
knock off the helmet of Arjuna. But it so happened that the wheel of his
chariot got stuck in the battlefield mud, and when he got down to set
the wheel right Arjuna took the opportunity and killed him, although he
requested Arjuna not to do so.

Naptri or Bhiirisrava: BhiiriSrava was the son of Somadutta, a member
of the Kuru family. His other brother was Salya. Both the brothers and the
father also attended the svayamvara ceremony of Draupadi. All of them
appreciated the wonderful strength of Arjuna due to his being the devotee
friend of the Lord, and thus Bhiirisrava advised the sons of Dhrtarastra not
to pick any quarrel nor to fight with them. All of them also attended the
Rajasiiya yajita of Maharaja Yudhisthira. He possessed one aksauhini
regiment of army, cavalry, elephants and chariots, and all these were
employed in the Battle of Kuruksetra on behalf of Duryodhana’s party.
He was counted by Bhima as one of the Yuthapatis. In the Battle of
Kuruksetra he was especially engaged in a fight with Satyaki, and he killed
ten sons of Satyaki. Later on, Arjuna cut off his hands, and he was
ultimately killed by Satyaki. After his death he merged into the existence
of Vidvadeva.

Trigarta or Susarma: Son of Maharaja Vrddhaksetra and the King of
Trigarta Desa, and he was also present in the svayarivara ceremony of
Draupadi. He was one of the allies of Duryodhana, and he advised
Duryodhana to attack the Matsyadesa (Darbhanga). During the time of
cow-stealing in Viratnagar, he was able to arrest Maharaja Virata, but later
on Maharaja Virata was released by Bhima, and in the Battle of Kuruksetra
he also fought very valiantly, but at the end he was killed by Arjuna.

Jayadratha: Another son of Maharaja Vrddhaksetra. He was the King of
Sindhu (modern Sind Pakistan) Desa. His wife’s name was Duh$ala. He was
also present in the svayamuvara ceremony of Draupadi, and he desired very
strongly to have her hand, but he failed in the competition. But since
then he sought always the opportunity to get in touch with Draupadi.
When he was going to marry in the Salya Desa, on the way to Kamyavan
he happened to see Draupadi again and was too much attracted to her.
The Pandavas and Draupadi were then in exile, after losing their empire in
gambling, and Jayadratha thought it wise to send news to Draupadi in an
illicit manner through Kotisasya, one of his associates. Draupadi at once
refused vehemently the proposal of Jayadratha,but being so much attract-
ed by the beauty of Draupadi, he tried again and again. Every time he was
refused by Draupadi he tried to take her away forcibly on his chariot, and
at first Draupadi gave him a good dashing, and he fell like a cut-root tree.
But he was not discouraged, and he was able to force Draupadi to sit on
the chariot. This incidence was seen by Dhaumya Muni, and he strongly
protested the action of Jayadratha. He also followed the chariot, and
through Dhatreyak the matter was brought to the notice of Maharaja
Yudhisthira. The Pandavas then attacked the soldiers of Jayadratha and
killed them all, and at last Bhima caught hold of Jayadratha and beat him


--- Page 131 ---
792 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 15
very severely, almost dead. Then all but five hairs were cut off his head
and he was taken to all the kings and introduced as the slave of Maharaja
Yudhisthira. He was forced to admit himself to be the slave of Maharaja
Yudhisthira before all the princely order, and in the same condition he was
brought before Maharaja Yudhisthira. Maharaja Yudhisthira was kind
enough to order him released, and when he admitted to become a tributory
prince under Maharaja Yudhisthira, Queen Draupadi also desired his release.
After this incidence, he was allowed to return to his country. Being so
insulted, he went to Gongotri in the Himalayas and undertook a severe
type of penance to please Lord Siva. He asked his benediction to defeat
all the Pandavas, at least one at a time. Then the Battle of Kuruksetra
began, and he took sides with Duryodhana. In the first day’s fight he was
engaged with Maharaja Drupada, then with Virata and then with
Abhimanyu. While Abhimanyu was being killed, mercilessly surrounded
by seven great generals, the Pandavas came to his help, but Jayadratha,
by the mercy of Lord Siva, repulsed them with great ability. At this,
Arjuna took a vow to kill him, and on hearing this, Jayadratha wanted to
leave the warfield and asked permission from the Kauravas for this cowardly
action. But he was not allowed to do so. On the contrary, he was obliged
to fight with Arjuna, and while the fight was going on Lord Krsna reminded
Arjuna that the benediction of Siva upon Jayadratha was that whoever
would cause his head to fall to the ground would die at once. He therefore
advised Arjuna to throw the head of Jayadratha directly onto the lap of
his father, who was engaged in penances at the Samanta Paficaka pilgrimage.
This was actually done by Arjuna. Jayadratha’s father was surprised to
see a severed head on his lap, and he at once threw it to the ground. The
father immediately died, his forehead being cracked in seven pieces.

TRANSLATION
It was by His mercy only that my enemies neglected to kill me when
I descended from my chariot to get water for my thirsty horses. And it
was due to my lack of esteem for my Lord that I dared engage Him as my
chariot driver, for He is worshiped and offered services by the best men to
attain salvation.
PURPORT

The Supreme Lord Personality of Godhead इन Krsna is the object of
worship both by impersonalists and by the devotees of the Lord. The
impersonalists worship His glowing effulgence, emanating from His tran-
scendental body of eternal form, bliss and knowledge, and the devotees
worship Him as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Those who are
below even the impersonalists consider Him to be one of the great histori-
cal personalities. The Lord, however, descends to attract all by his specific
transcendental pastimes, and thus He plays the part of the most perfect
master, friend, son and lover. His transcendental relation with Arjuna was
in friendship, and the Lord therefore played the part perfectly, as He did
with His parents, lovers and wives. While playing in such a perfect tran-
scendental relation, the devotee forgets, by the internal potency of the
Lord, that his friend or son is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, al-
though sometimes the devotee is bewildered by the acts of the Lord.
After the departure of the Lord, Arjuna is conscious of his great friend,
but there is no mistake on the part of Arjuna, nor any ill-estimation of the
Lord. Intelligent men are attracted by the transcendental acting of the
Lord with a pure unalloyed devotee like Arjuna.

In the warfield, scarcity of water is a well-known fact. Water is very
rare there, and both the animals and men, working strenuously in the war-


--- Page 133 ---
794 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 15
field, constantly require water to quench their thrist. Especially wounded
soldiers and generals feel very thirsty at the time of death, and it sometimes
so happens that simply for want of water one has to die unavoidably. But
such scarcity of water was solved in the Battle of Kuruksetra by means of
boring the ground. By God’s grace, water can be easily obtained from any
place if there is facility for boring the ground. The modern system works
on the same principle of boring the ground, but modern engineers are still
unable to dig immediately wherever necessary. It appears, however, from
the history as far back as the days of the Pandavas, that big generals like
Arjuna could at once supply water even to the horses, and what to speak
of men, by drawing water from underneath the hard ground simply by
penetrating the stratum with a sharp arrow, a method still unknown to
the modern scientists.

Generally both of us used to live together, sleep, sit and loiter to-

there were any irregularity, I used to reproach Him by saying, “My friend,
You are very truthful.” Even in those hours when His value was minimized,
He, being the Supreme Soul, used to tolerate all those utterings of mine,
excusing me exactly as a true friend excuses his true friend, or a father
excuses his son.
PURPORT
Since the Supreme Lord Sri Krsna is all-perfect, His transcendental
pastimes with His pure devotees never lack anything in any respect, either
as a friend, son or lover. The Lord relishes the reproaches of friends,
parents or fiancees more than the Vedic hymns which are offered to Him
by great learned scholars and religionists in an official fashion.

0 Emperor, now I am separated from my friend and dearmost well-
wisher, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore my heart
appears to be void of everything. In His absence I have been defeated by a
number of infidel cowherdmen while I was guarding the bodies of all the
wives of Krsna.
PURPORT
The important point in this verse is how it was possible that Arjuna
could be defeated by a gang of ignoble cowherdmen and how such mun-
dane cowherdmen could touch the bodies of the wives of Lord Krsna who
were under the protection of Arjuna. Srila Viévanatha Cakravarti Thakur
has justified the contradiction by research in the Visnu Purana and Brahma
Purana. In these Puranas it is said that once the fair denizens of heaven
pleased Astavakra Muni by their service and were blessed by the Muni to
have the Supreme Lord as their husband. Astavakra Muni was curved
in eight joints of his body, and thus he used to move in a peculiarly


--- Page 136 ---
Text 21] The Pandavas Retire Timely 797
curved manner. The daughters of the demigods could not check their
laughter upon seeing the movements of the Muni, and the Muni, being
angry at them, cursed them that they would be kidnapped by rogues, even
if they would get the Lord as their husband. Later on, the girls again
satisfied the Muni by their prayers, and the Muni blessed them that they
would regain their husband even after being robbed by the rogues. So, in
order to keep the words of the great Muni, the Lord Himself kidnapped
His wives from the protection of Arjuna, otherwise they would have at
once vanished from the scene as soon as they were touched by the
rogues. Besides that, some of the gopis who prayed to become wives of the
Lord returned to their respective positions after their desire was fulfilled.
After the departure of Lord Krsna, He wanted all His entourage back to
Godhead, and they were called back under different conditions only.

the kings offered their due respects. But in the absence of Lord Krsna, all
of them, at a moment’s notice, have become null and void. It is exactly
like offering clarified butter on ashes, accumulating money with a magic
wand or sowing seeds on barren land.
PURPORT
As we have discussed more than once, one should not be puffed up by
borrowed plumes. All energies and powers are derived from the supreme
source, Lord Krsna, and they act as long as He desires and cease to
function as soon as He withdraws. All electrical energies are received from
the powerhouse, and as soon as the powerhouse stops supplying energy,
the bulbs are of no use. In a moment’s time such energies can be generated
or withdrawn by the supreme will of the Lord. Material civilization with-
out the blessing of the Lord is child’s play only. As long as the parents
allow the child to play, it is all right. As soon as the parents withdraw, the
child has to stop. Human civilization and all activities thereof must be
dovetailed with the supreme blessing of the Lord, and without this blessing
all advancement of human civilization is like decoration on a dead body. It
is said here that a dead civilization and its activities are something like
clarified butter on ashes, the accumulation of money by a magic wand and
the sowing of seeds in barren land.

PURPORT
According to the anthropologists, there is nature’s law of struggle for
existence and survival of the fittest. But they do not know that behind the
law of nature there is the supreme direction of the Supreme Lord
Personality of Godhead. In the Bhagavad-gita it is confirmed that the law
of nature is executed under the direction of the Lord. Whenever, therefore,
there is peace in the world it must be known that it is due to the good will
of the Lord. And whenever there is upheaval in the world, it is also due to
the supreme will of the Lord. Not a blade of grass moves without the will
of the Lord. Whenever, therefore, there is disobedience of the established
rules enacted by the Lord, there is war between men and nations. The
surest way to the path of peace is, therefore, dovetailing everything to the
established rule of the Lord. The established rule is that whatever we do,
whatever we eat, whatever we sacrifice or whatever we give in charity must
be done to the full satisfaction of the Lord. No one should do anything,
eat anything, sacrifice anything or give anything in charity against the will
of the Lord. Discretion is the better part of valor, and one must learn how
to discriminate between actions which may be pleasing to the Lord and
those which may not be pleasing to the Lord. An action is thus judged by
the Lord’s pleasure or displeasure. There is no room for personal whims;
we must always be guided by the pleasure of the Lord. Such action is
called yoga-karmasya kausalam, or actions performed which are linked
with the Supreme Lord. That is the art of doing a thing perfectly.

PURPORT
In the material world the struggle for existence and survival of the
fittest are laws because in the material world there is disparity between
conditioned souls due to everyone’s desire to lord it over the material
resources. This very mentality of lording it over the material nature is the
root cause of conditioned life. And to give facility to such imitation lords,
the illusory energy of the Lord has created a disparity between conditioned
living beings by creating the stronger and the weaker in every species of
life. The mentality of lording it over the material nature and the cre-
ation has naturally created a disparity and therefore the law of struggle for
existence. In the spiritual world there is no such disparity, nor is there such
a struggle for existence. In the spiritual world there is no struggle for exist-
ence because everyone there exists eternally. There is no disparity because
everyone wants to render service to the Supreme Lord, and no one wants
to imitate the Lord in becoming the beneficiary. The Lord, being creator
of everything including the living beings, factually is the proprietor and
enjoyer of everything that be, but in the material world, by the spell of
maya or illusion, this eternal relation with the Supreme Personality of
Godhead is forgotten, and so the living being is conditioned under the law
of struggle for existence and survival of the fittest.

TRANSLATION
Now I am attracted to those instructions imparted to me by the
Personality of Godhead [Govinda] because they are impregnated with
instructions for relieving the burning heart in all circumstances of time
and space.
PURPORT
Herein Arjuna refers to the instruction of the Bhagavad-gita, which was
imparted to him by the Lord in the Battlefield of Kuruksetra. The Lord
left behind Him the instructions of the Bhagavad-gita not only for the
benefit of Arjuna alone, but also for all time and in all lands. The Bhagavad-
gita, being spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the essence
of all Vedic wisdom. It is nicely presented by the Lord Himself for all who
have very little time to go through the vast Vedic literatures like the
Upanisads, Puranas and Vedanta-siitras. It is put within the study of the
great historical epic Mahabharata, which was especially prepared for the
less intelligent class, namely the women, the laborers and those who are
worthless descendants of the brahmanas, ksatriyas and higher sections of
the vaisyas. The problem which arose in the heart of Arjuna on the
Battlefield of Kuruksetra was solved by the teachings of the Bhagavad-gita.
Again, after the departure of the Lord from the vision of earthly people,
when Arjuna was face to face with being vanquished in his acquired power
and prominence, he wanted again to remember the great teachings of the
Bhagavad-gita just to teach all concerned that the Bhagavad-gita could be
consulted in all critical times, not only for solace from all kinds of mental


--- Page 142 ---
Text 27] The Pandavas Retire Timely 803
agonies, but also for the way out of great entanglements which may
embarrass one in some critical hour.

The merciful Lord left behind Him the great teachings of the Bhagavad-
gita so that one can take the instructions of the Lord even when He is not
visible to material eyesight. Material senses cannot have any estimation of
the Supreme Lord, but by His inconceivable power, the Lord can incarnate
Himself to the sense perception of the conditioned souls in a suitable
manner through the agency of matter, which is also another form of the
Lord’s manifested energy. Thus the Bhagavad-gita, or any authentic scrip-
tural sound representation of the Lord, is also the incarnation of the Lord.
There is no difference between the sound representation of the Lord and
the Lord Himself. One can derive the same benefit from the Bhagavad-gita
as Arjuna did in the personal presence of the Lord.

The faithful human being who is desirous of being liberated from the
clutches of material existence can very easily take advantage of the
Bhagavad-gita, and with this in view, the Lord instructed Arjuna as if
Arjuna were in need of it. In the Bhagavad-gita, five important factors of
knowledge have been delineated pertaining to 1) the Supreme Lord, 2) the
living being, 3) nature, 4) time and space, and 5) the process of activity.
Out of these, the Supreme Lord and the living being are qualitatively one.
The difference between the two has been analyzed as the difference
between the whole and the part and parcel. Nature is inert matter dis-
playing the interaction of three different modes, and eternal time and
unlimited space are considered to be beyond the existence of the material
nature. Activities of the living being are different varieties of aptitudes
which can entrap or liberate the living being within and without material
nature. All these subject matters are concisely discussed in the Bhagavad-
git, and later the subject matters are elaborated in the Srimad-Bhagavatam
for further enlightenment. Out of the five subjects, the Supreme Lord, the
living entity, nature and time and space are eternal, but the living entity,
nature and time are under the direction of the Supreme Lord, who is
absolute and completely independent of any other control. The Supreme
Lord is the supreme controller. The material activity of the living being
is beginningless, but it can be rectified by transferral into the spiritual
quality. Thus it can cease its material qualitative reactions. Both the Lord
and the living entity are cognizant, and both have the sense of identifica-
tion, of being conscious as a living force. But the living being under the
condition of material nature, called mahat-tattva, misidentifies himself as
being different from the Lord. The whole scheme of Vedic wisdom is
targetted to the aim of eradicating such a misconception and thus liber-
ating the living being from the illusion of material identification. When
such an illusion is eradicated by knowledge and renunciation, the living


--- Page 143 ---
804 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 15
beings are responsible actors and enjoyers also. The sense of enjoy-
ment in the Lord is real, but such sense in the living being is a sort of
wishful desire only. This difference in consciousness is the distinction of
the two identities, namely the Lord and the living being. Otherwise there
is no difference between the Lord and the living being. The living being
is therefore eternally one and different simultaneously. The whole instruc-
tion of the Bhagavad-gita stands on this principle.

In the Bhagavad-gita the Lord and the living beings are both described
as sandtana, or eternal, and the Lord’s abode far beyond the material sky
is also described as sandtana. The living being is invited to live in the
sandtana existence of the Lord, and the process which can help a living
being to approach the Lord’s abode, where the liberated activity of the
soul is exhibited, is called sanatana-dharma. One cannot, however, reach
the eternal abode of the Lord without being free from the misconception
of material identification, and the Bhagavad-gita gives us the clue how to
achieve this stage of perfection. The process of being liberated from the
misconception of material identification is called, in different stages,
fruitive activity, empiric philosophy and devotional service, up to tran-
scendental realization. Such transcendental realization is made possible by
dovetailing all the above items in relation with the Lord. Prescribed duties
of the human being, as directed in the Vedas, can gradually purify the
sinful mind of the conditioned soul and raise him to the stage of know-
ledge. The purified stage of acquiring knowledge becomes the basis of
devotional service of the Lord. As long as one is engaged in researching
the solution of the problems of life, it is called jiidana, or purified know-
ledge, but on realizing the actual solution of life, one becomes situated in
the devotional service of the Lord. The Bhagavad-gita begins with the
problems of life by discriminating the soul from the elements of matter
and proves by all reason and argument that the soul is indestructible in all
circumstances and that the outer covering of matter, the body and the
mind, change for another term of material existence v/hich is full of
miseries. The Bhagavad-gita is therefore meant for terminating all different
types of miseries, and Arjuna took shelter of this great knowledge which
was imparted to him before, during the Kuruksetra battle.

TRANSLATION
Sata Gosvami said: Thus being deeply absorbed in thinking of the
instructions of the Lord, which were imparted in the great intimacy of
friendship, and in thinking of His lotus feet, Arjuna’s mind became paci-
fied and free from all material contamination.
PURPORT
Since the Lord is absolute, deep meditation upon Him is as good as
yogic trance. The Lord is nondifferent from His name, form, quality,
pastimes, entourage and specific actions. Arjuna began to think of the
Lord’s instructions to Him on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra. Those instruc-
tions only began to eliminate the tinges of material contamination in the
mind of Arjuna. The Lord is like the sun; the sun’s appearance means
immediate dissipation of darkness, or ignorance, and the Lord’s appearance
within the mind of the devotee can at once drive away the miserable
material effects. Lord Caitanya has therefore recommended constant
chanting of the name of the Lord for protection from all contamination
of the material world. The feeling of separation from the Lord is undoubt-
edly painful to the devotee, but because it is in connection with the Lord,
it has a specific transcendental effect which pacifies the heart. Feelings of
separation are also sources of transcendental bliss, and they are never
comparable to contaminated material feelings of separation.

Arjuna’s constant remembrance of the lotus feet of Lord Sri Krsna
rapidly increased his devotion, and as a result all the trash in his thoughts
subsided.
PURPORT
Material desires in the mind are the trash of material contamination.
By such contamination, the living being is faced with so many compatible
and incompatible things that discourage the very existence of spiritual
identity. Birth after birth the conditioned soul is entrapped with so many
pleasing and displeasing elements which are all false and temporary. They
accumulate due to our reaction to material desires, but when we get into
touch with the transcendental Lord in His variegated energies by devotion-
al service, the naked forms of all material desires become manifest, and
the intelligence of the living being is pacified in its true color. As soon as
Arjuna turned his attention towards the instructions of the Lord, as they
are inculcated in the Bhagavad-gita, his true color of eternal association
with the Lord became manifest, and thus he felt freed from all material
contaminations.

TRANSLATION
Because of the Lord’s pastimes and activities and because of His
absence, it appeared that Arjuna forgot the instructions left by the
Personality of Godhead. But factually this was not the case, and again
he became lord of his senses.
PURPORT

A conditioned soul is enwrapped in his fruitive activities by the force of
eternal time. But the Supreme Lord, when He incarnates on the earth, is
not influenced by kala, or the material conception of past, present and
future. The activities of the Lord are eternal, and they are manifestations
of His @tma-maya, or internal potency. All pastimes or activities of the
Lord are spiritual in nature, but to the laymen they appear to be on the
same level with material activities. It so appeared that Arjuna and the
Lord were engaged on the Battle of Kuruksetra as the other party
was also engaged, but factually the Lord was executing His mission of
incarnation in association with His eternal friend Arjuna. Therefore such
apparent material activities of Arjuna did not drive him away from his
transcendental position, but on the contrary revived his consciousness of
the songs of the Lord, as He sang them personally. This revival of
consciousness is assured by the Lord in the Bhagavad-gita as follows:

manmand bhava mad-bhakto madyaji mam namaskuru
mam evaigyasi satyari te pratijane priyo’si me.
(Bg. 18:65)

One should think of the Lord always; the mind should not forget Him.
One should become a devotee of the Lord and offer obeisances unto Him.
One who lives in that fashion becomes undoubtedly endowed with the
blessing of the Lord by achieving the shelter of His lotus feet. There is
nothing to" doubt about this eternal truth. Because Arjuna was His
confidential friend, the secret was disclosed to him.

Arjuna had no desire to fight with his relatives, but he fought for the
mission of the Lord. He was always engaged in the execution of His


--- Page 147 ---
808 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 15
mission only, and therefore after His departure he remained in the same
transcendental position, even though it appeared that he forgot all the
instructions of the Bhagavad-gita. One should, therefore, adjust the
activities of life in pace with the mission of the Lord, and by doing this
one is sure to return back home, back to Godhead. This is the highest
perfection of life.

TRANSLATION
Because of his possessing spiritual assets, the doubts of duality were
completely cut off. Thus he was freed from the three modes of material
nature and placed in transcendence. There was no longer any chance of his
becoming entangled in birth and death, for he was freed from material
form.
PURPORT

Doubts of duality begin from the misconception of the material body,
which is accepted as the self by less intelligent persons. The most foolish
part of our ignorance is our identifying this material body with the self.
Everything in relation with the body is ignorantly accepted as our own.
Doubts due to misconceptions of myself and mine, in other words, my
body, my relatives, my property, my wife, my children, my wealth, my
country, my community, and hundreds and thousands of similar illusory
contemplations, cause bewilderment for the conditioned soul. By assimi-


--- Page 148 ---
Text 31] The Pandavas Retire Timely 809
lating the instructions of the Bhagavad-gita, one is sure to become released
from such bewilderment because real knowledge is to know that the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vasudeva, Lord Krsna, is everything,
including one’s self. Everything is a manifestation of His potency as part
and parcel. The potency and the potent are nondifferent, so the concep-
tion of duality is at once mitigated by attainment of perfect knowledge.
As soon as Arjuna took up the instructions of the Bhagavad-gita, expert as
he was, he could at once eradicate the material conception of Lord Krsna,
his eternal friend. He could realize that the Lord was still present before
him by His instruction, by His form, by His pastimes, by His qualities and
everything else related to Him. He could realize that Lord Krsna, his
friend, was still present before him by His transcendental presence in
different nondual energies, and there was no question of attainment of the
association of the Lord by another change of body under the influence of
time and space. By attainment of absolute knowledge, one can be in
association with the Lord constantly, even in this present life, simply
by hearing, chanting, thinking of and worshiping the Supreme Lord. One can
see Him, one can feel His presence even in this present life simply by
understanding the advaya-jiidgna Lord, or the Absolute Lord, through the
process of devotional service, which begins with hearing about Him.
Lord Caitanya says that simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord
one can at once wash off the dust on the mirror of pure consciousness,
and as soon as the dust is removed, one is at once freed from all material
conditions. To become free from material conditions means to liberate
the soul. As soon as one is, therefore, situated in absolute knowledge, his
material conception of life is removed or emerges from a false conception
of life. Thus the function of the pure soul is revived in spiritual realization.
This practical realization of the living being is made possible due to his
becoming free from the reaction of the three modes of material nature,
namely goodness, passion and ignorance. By the grace of the Lord, a pure

devotee is at once raised to the place of the Absolute, and there is no
chance of the devotee becoming materially entangled again in conditioned
life. One is not able to feel the presence of the Lord in all circumstances
until one is endowed with the required transcendental vision made possible
by devotional service prescribed in the revealed scriptures. Arjuna attained
this stage long before on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra, and when he

apparently felt the absence of the Lord, he at once took shelter of the
instructions of the Bhagavad-gita, and thus again he was placed in his
original position. This is the position of visoka, or the stage of being freed
from all grief and anxieties.

TRANSLATION
Upon hearing of Lord Krsna’s returning to His abode, and upon
understanding the end of the Yadu dynasty’s earthly manifestation,
Maharaja Yudhisthira decided to go back home, back to Godhead.
PURPORT

Maharaja Yudhisthira also turned his attention to the instructions of
the Bhagavad-gita after hearing about the Lord’s departure from the
vision of earthly people. He began to deliberate on the Lord’s way of
appearance and departure. The mission of the Lord’s appearance and
disappearance in the mortal universe is completely dependent on His
supreme will. He is not forced to appear or disappear by any superior
energy, as the living beings appear and disappear, being forced by the laws
of nature. Whenever the Lord likes, He can appear Himself from anywhere
and everywhere without disturbing His appearance and disappearance in
any other place. He is like the sun. The sun appears and disappears on its
own accord at any place without disturbing its presence in other places.
The sun appears in the morning in India without disappearing from the
western hemisphere. The sun is present everywhere and anywhere all over
the solar system, but it so appears that in a particular place the sun appears
in the morning and also disappears at some fixed time in the evening. The
time limitation even of the sun is of no concern, and so what to speak of


--- Page 150 ---
Text 33] The Pandavas Retire Timely 811
the Supreme Lord who is the creator and controller of the sun. Therefore,
in the Bhagavad-gita it is stated that anyone who factually understands
the transcendental appearance and disappearance of the Lord by His
inconceivable energy becomes liberated from the laws of birth and death
and is placed in the eternal spiritual sky where the Vaikuntha planets are.
There such liberated persons can eternally live without the pangs of birth,
death, old age and disease. In the spiritual sky the Lord and those who are
eternally engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord are all
eternally young because there is no old age and disease, and there is no
death. Because there is no death there is no birth. It is concluded therefore
that simply by understanding the Lord’s appearance and disappearance in
truth, one can attain the perfectional stage of eternal life. Therefore,
Maharaja Yudhisthira also began to consider going back to Godhead. The
Lord appears on the earth or any other mortal planet along with His
associates who live with Him eternally, and the members of the Yadu
family who were engaged in supplementing the pastimes of the Lord are no
other than His eternal associates and so also Maharaja Yudhisthira and his
brothers and mother, etc. Since the appearance and disappearance of the
Lord and His eternal associates are transcendental, one should not be
bewildered by the external features of appearance and disappearance.

Kunti, after overhearing Arjuna’s telling of the end of the Yadu dy-
nasty and disappearance of Lord Krsna, engaged in the devotional service
of the transcendental Personality of Godhead with full attention and thus
gained release from the course of material existence.
PURPORT

The setting of the sun does not mean the end of the sun. It means that
the sun is out of our sight. Similarly, the end of the mission of the Lord
on a particular planet or universe only means that He is out of our sight.
The end of the Yadu dynasty also does not mean that it is annihilated. It
disappears, along with the Lord, out of our sight. As Maharaja Yudhisthira
decided to prepare to go back to Godhead, so also Kunti decided, and thus
she fully engaged herself in the transcendental devotional service of the
Lord, which guarantees one passport for going back to Godhead after
quitting this present material body. The beginning of devotional service of
the Lord is the beginning of spiritualizing the present body, and thus an
unalloyed devotee of the Lord loses all material contact in the present
body. The abode of the Lord is not a myth, as is thought by the unbelievers
or ignorant people, but one cannot reach there by any material means like
a sputnik or space capsule. But one can certainly reach there after leaving
this present body, and one must prepare himself to go back to Godhead by
practicing devotional service. That guarantees a passport for going back to
Godhead, and Kunti adopted it.

TRANSLATION
The Supreme Unborn Lord Sri Krsna caused the members of the Yadu
dynasty to relinquish their bodies, and thus He relieved the burden of the
world. This action was like picking out a thorn with a thorn, though both
are the same to the controller.
PURPORT
Srila Viévanatha Cakravarti Thakur suggests that the rsis like Saunaka
and others who were hearing Srimad-Bhdgavatam from Sita Gosvami at
Naimisaranya were not happy to hear about the Yadus’ dying in the
madness of intoxication. To give them relief from this mental agony, Sita
Gosvami assured them that the Lord caused the members of the Yadu
dynasty to relinquish their bodies by which they had to take away the
burden of the world. The Lord and His eternal associates appeared on earth
to help the administrative demigods in eradicating the burden of the world.
He therefore called for some of the confidential demigods to appear in the
Yadu family and serve Him in His great mission. After the mission was
fulfilled, the demigods, by the will of the Lord, relinquished their corporeal
bodies by fighting amongst themselves in the madness of intoxication. The
demigods are accustomed to drinking soma-rasa beverage, and therefore
the drinking of wine and intoxication are not unknown to them. Some-
times they were put into trouble for indulging in intoxication. Once the
sons of Kuvera fell in the wrath of Narada for being intoxicated, but
afterwards they regained their original forms by the grace of the Lord Sri
Krsna. We shall find this story in the Tenth Canto. For the Supreme Lord,
both the asuras and the demigods are equal, but the demigods are obedient
to the Lord, whereas the asuras are not. Therefore, the example of picking
out a thorn by another thorn is quite befitting. One thorn, which causes
pinpricks on the leg of the Lord, is certainly disturbing to the Lord, and
the other thorn, which takes out the disturbing elements, certainly gives
service to the Lord. So although every living being is a part and parcel of
the Lord, still one who is a pinprick of the Lord is called an asura, and one
who is a voluntary servitor of the Lord is called a devatd or demigod. In the
material world the devatds and asuras are always contending, and the
devatds are always saved from the hands of the asuras by the Lord. Both
of them are under the control of the Lord. The world is full of two kinds
of living beings, and the Lord’s mission is always to protect the devatas and
destroy the asuras, whenever there is such need in the world, and to do
good to both of them.

TRANSLATION
The Supreme Lord relinquished the body which He manifested to
diminish the burden of the earth. Just like a magician, He relinquishes one
body to accept different ones, like the fish incarnation, etc.
PURPORT
The Supreme Lord Personality of Godhead is neither impersonal nor
formless, but His body is nondifferent from Him, and therefore He is
known as the embodiment of eternity, knowledge and bliss. In the
Brhad-vaisnava Tantra it is clearly mentioned that anyone who considers
the form of the Lord Krsna to be made of material energy must be
ostracized by all means. And if by chance the face of such an infidel is
seen, one must clean himself by jumping in the river with his clothing.
The Lord is described as amrta, or deathless, because He has no material
body. Under the circumstances, the Lord’s dying or quitting His body is
like the jugglery of a magician. The magician shows by his tricks that he
is cut into pieces, burnt into ashes or made unconscious by hypnotic
influences, etc., but all are false shows only. Factually the magician
himself is neither burnt into ashes nor is he cut into pieces nor is he dead
or uncenscious at any stage of his magical demonstration. Similarly, the
Lord has His eternal forms of unlimited variety of which the fish incarna-
tion, as was exhibited within this universe, is also one. Because there are
innumerable universes, somewhere or other the fish incarnation must be
manifesting His pastimes without cessation. In this verse, the particular


--- Page 154 ---
Text 36] The Pandavas Retire Timely 815
word dhatte, eternally accepted, (and not the word dhatva, accepted for
the occasion) is used. The idea is that the Lord does not create the
incarnation of fish; He has eternally such a form, and the appearance and
disappearance of such an incarnation serve particular purposes. In the
Bhagavad-gita the Lord says (Bg. 7.24-25), “1116 impersonalists think that
1 have no form and that I am formless, but that at present I have accepted
a form to serve a purpose, and now I am manifested. But such speculators
are factually without sharp intelligence. Though they may be good scholars
in the Vedic literatures, they are practically ignorant of My inconceivable
energies and My eternal forms of Personality. The reason is that I reserve
the power of not being exposed to the nondevotees by My mystic curtain.
The less intelligent fools are therefore unaware of My eternal form, which
is never to be vanquished and is unborn.” In the Padma Purana it is said
that those who are envious and always angry at the Lord are unfit to know
the actual and eternal form of the Lord. In the Bhagavatam also it
is said that the Lord appeared like a thunderbolt to those who were
wrestlers. Sisupala, at the time of being killed by the Lord, could not see
Him as Krsna, being dazzled by the glare of the brahmajyoti. Therefore,
the temporary manifestation of the Lord as a thunderbolt to the wrestlers
appointed by Karhsa, or the glaring appearance of the Lord before Sisupala,
etc., were relinquished by the Lord, but the Lord as a magician is
eternally existent and is never vanquished in any circumstance. Such
forms are temporarily shown to the asuras only, and when such exhibitions
are withdrawn, the asuras think that the Lord is no more existent, just as
the foolish audience thinks the magician to be burnt to ashes or cut into
pieces. The conclusion is that the Lord has no material body, and therefore
He is never to be killed or changed by His transcendental body.

TRANSLATION
When the Personality of Godhead Lord Krsna left this earthly planet
in His selfsame form, from that very day Kali, who had appeared partially
before, became fully manifest to create inauspicious conditions for those
who are endowed with a poor fund of knowledge.
PURPORT
The influence of Kali can be enforced only upon those who are not fully
developed in God consciousness. One can neutralize the effects of Kali by
keeping oneself fully under the supreme care of the Personality of God-
head. The age of Kali ensued just after the Battle of Kuruksetra, but it
could not exert its influence because of the presence of the Lord. The
Lord, however, left this earthly planet in His own transcendental body,
and as soon as He left, the symptoms of the Kali-yuga, as were envisioned
by Maharaja Yudhisthira prior to Arjuna’s arrival from Dvaraka, began to
manifest, and Maharaja Yudhisthira rightly conjectured on the departure
of the Lord from earth. As we have already explained, the Lord left our
sight just as when the sun sets it is out of our sight.

TRANSLATION
Maharaja Yudhisthira was intelligent enough to understand the influ-
ence of the age of Kali (characterized by increasing avarice, falsehood,
cheating and violence throughout the capital, state and home and among
individuals). So he wisely prepared himself to leave home, and he dressed
accordingly.
PURPORT
The present age is influenced by the specific qualities of Kali, and
since the days of the Battle of Kuruksetra, about five thousand years ago,
the influence of the age of Kali began manifesting, and from authentic
scriptures it is learned that the age of Kali is still to run on for 427,000
years. The symptoms of the Kali-yuga, as mentioned above, namely
avarice, falsehood, diplomacy, cheating, nepotism, violence and all such
things, are already in vogue, and no one can imagine what is going to
happen gradually with further increase of the influence of Kali till the day
of annihilation. We have already come to know that the influence of the
age of Kali is meant for godless so-called civilized man, otherwise those
who are under the protection of the Lord have nothing to fear from this
horrible age. Maharaja Yudhisthira was a great devotee of the Lord, and
there was no necessity of his being afraid of the age of Kali, but he pre-
ferred to retire from active household life and prepare himself to go back
home, back to Godhead. The Pandavas are eternal companions of the
Lord, and therefore they are more interested in the company of the Lord
than anything else. Besides that, being an ideal king, Maharaja Yudhisthira
wanted to retire just to set an example for others. As soon as there is some
young fellow to look after the household affairs, one should at once
retire from family life to uplift oneself to spiritual realization. No one
should rot in the dark well of household life till one is dragged by the will
of Yamaraja. Modern politicians should take lessons from Maharaja
Yudhisthira about voluntary retirement from active life and should make
room far the vaunger generation. Also retired old gentlemen should take a


--- Page 157 ---
818 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 15
lesson from him and leave home for spiritual realization before forcefully
dragged away to meet death.

TRANSLATION
Thereafter, in the capital of Hastinapura, he enthroned his grandson,
who was trained and equally qualified, as the emperor and master of all
land bordered by the seas.
PURPORT
The total land on the earth bordered by the seas was under the sub-
jugation of the King of Hastinapura. Maharaja Yudhisthira trained his
grandson Maharaja Pariksit, who was equally qualified, in state administra-
tion in terms of the king’s obligation to the citizens. Thus Pariksit was
enthroned on the seat of Maharaja Yudhisthira prior to his departure back
to Godhead. Concerning Maharaja Pariksit, the specific word used, vina-
yinam, is significant. Why was the King of Hastinapura, at least till
the time of Maharaja Pariksit, accepted as the Emperor of the world? The
only reason is that the people of the world were happy because of the good
administration of the Emperor. The happiness of the citizens was due to
the ample production of natural produce such as grains, fruits, milk, herbs,
valuable stones, minerals and everything that the people needed. They


--- Page 158 ---
Text 39] The Pandavas Retire Timely 819
were even free from all bodily miseries, anxieties of mind, and disturbances
caused by natural phenomena and other living beings. Because everyone
was happy in all respects, there was no resentment, although there were
sometimes battles between the state kings for political reasons and suprem-
acy. Everyone was trained to attain the highest goal of life, and therefore
the people were also enlightened enough not to quarrel over trivialities.
The influence of the age of Kali gradually infiltrated the good qualities
of both the kings and the citizens, and therefore a tense situation developed
between the ruler and the ruled, but still even in this age of disparity
between the ruler and the ruled, there can be spiritual emolument and God
consciousness. That is a special prerogative.

Then he posted Vajra, the son of Aniruddha (grandson of Lord Krsna),

performed a Prajapati sacrifice and placed in himself the fire for quitting
household life.

PURPORT

Maharaja Yudhisthira, after placing Maharaja Pariksit on the imperial
throne of Hastinapura, and after posting Vajra, the great-grandson of Lord
Krsna, as the King of Mathura, accepted the renounced order of life. The


--- Page 159 ---
820 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 15
system of four orders of life and four castes in terms of quality and work
known as varnasrama-dharma, is the beginning of real human life, and
Maharaja Yudhisthira, as the protector of this system of human activities,
timely retired from active life as a sannydsi, handing over the charge of the
administration to a trained prince, Maharaja Pariksit. The scientific system
of varnasrama-dharma divides the human life in four divisions of occupa-
tion and four orders of life. The four orders of life as brahmacari, grhastha,
vanaprastha and sannyadsa are to be followed by all, irrespective of the
occupational division. Modern politicians do not wish to retire from active
life, even if they are old enough, but Yudhisthira Maharaja, as an ideal
king, voluntarily retired from active administrative life to prepare himself
for the next life. Everyone’s life must be so arranged that the last stage of
life, say at least the last fifteen to twenty years prior to death, can be
absolutely devoted to devotional service of the Lord to attain the highest
perfection of life. It is really foolishness to engage oneself all the days of
one’s life in material enjoyment and fruitive activities, because as long as
the mind remains absorbed in fruitive work for material enjoyment, there
is no chance of getting out from conditioned life or material bondage. No
one should follow the suicidal policy of neglecting one’s supreme task of
attaining the highest perfection of life, namely going back home, back to
Godhead.

Text 41] The Pandavas Retire Timely 821
PURPORT

To become purified of material contamination is the necessary qualifi-
cation for becoming one of the associates of the Lord. No one can become
an associate of the Lord or can go back to Godhead without such purifi-
cation. Maharaja Yudhisthira, therefore, to become spiritually pure, at
once gave up his royal opulence by dress and garments. The kasaya or
saffron loincloth of a sannydsi indicates freedom from all attractive mate-
rial garments, and thus he changed his dress accordingly. He became dis-
interested in his kingdom and family and thus became free from all material
contamination_or material designation. People are generally attached to
various kinds of designations, namely the designations of family, society,
country, occupation, wealth, position and many others. As long as one is
attached to such designations, he is considered materially impure. The so-
called leaders of men in the modern age are attached by national
consciousness, but they do not know that such false consciousness
is also another designation of the materially conditioned soul,
and one has to relinquish such designations before one can become
eligible to go back to Godhead. Foolish people, however, adore such men
who die in national consciousness, but here is an example of Maharaja
Yudhisthira, a royal king who prepared himself to leave this world without
such national consciousness. And yet he is remembered even today because
he was a great pious king, almost on the same level with the Personality of
Godhead Sri Rama. And because people of the world were dominated by
such pious kings, they were happy in all respects, and it was quite possible
for such great emperors to rule the world.

TRANSLATION

Then he amalgamated all the sense organs into the mind, then the mind
into life, life into breathing, his total existence into the embodiments of
the five elements and his body into death. Then as pure self, he became

free from the material conception of life.

PURPORT
Maharaja Yudhisthira, like his brother Arjuna, began to concentrate and
gradually became freed from all material bondage. First of all he concen-
trated all the actions of the senses amalgamated in the mind, or in other
words he turned his mind towards transcendental service of the Lord. He
prayed that all material activities were performed by the mind, actions
and reactions of the material senses, and since he was going back to God-
head, the mind would wind up its material activities and be turned towards
the transcendental service of the Lord. There was no longer need for mate-
rial activities. Actually the activities of the mind cannot be stopped be-
cause they are the reflection of the eternal soul, but the quality of the
activities can be changed from matter to the transcendental service of the
Lord. The material color of the mind is changed by washing it from con-
taminations of life-breathing and thereby getting it freed from the con-
tamination of repeated births and deaths and getting it situated in pure
spiritual life. All is manifested by the temporary embodiment of the mate-
rial body, which is a production of mind at the time of death, and if the
mind is purified by practice of transcendental loving service of the Lord,
and the same is constantly engaged in the service of the lotus feet of the
Lord, there is no more chance of the mind’s producing another material
body after death. It will be freed from the absorption of material contami-
nation. The pure soul will be able to return back home, back to Godhead.

TRANSLATION
Thus annihilating the gross body of five elements into the three
qualitative modes of material nature, he merged them in one nescience
and then absorbed that nescience in the self, Brahman, which is inexhaust-
ible in all circumstances.
PURPORT
All that is manifested in the material world is the product of the mahat-
tattva avyakta, and things that are visible in our material vision are nothing
but combinations and permutations of such variegated material products.
But the living entity is different from such material products. It is due to
the living entity’s forgetfulness of his eternal nature as eternal servitor of
the Lord, and his false conception of becoming a so-called lord of the
material nature, that he is obliged to enter into the existence of false sense
enjoyment. Thus a concomitant generation of material energies is the
principal cause of the mind’s being materially affected. Thus the gross
body of five elements is produced. Maharaja Yudhisthira reversed the
action and merged the five elements of the body in the three modes of
material nature. The qualitative distinction of the body as being good, bad
or mediocre is extinguished, and again the qualitative manifestations be-
come merged in material energy, which is produced from a false sense of
the pure living being. When one is thus inclined to become an associate of
the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, in one of the innumerable
planets of the spiritual sky, especially in Goloka Vrndavana, one has to
think always that he is different from the material energy; he has nothing
to do with it, and he has to realize himself as pure spirit or Brahman,
qualitatively equal with the Supreme Brahman (Paramesvara). Maharaja
Yudhisthira, after distributing his kingdom to Pariksit and Vajra, did not
think himself Emperor of the world nor head of the Kuru dynasty.
This sense of freedom from material relations, as well as freedom from
material encagement of the gross and subtle encirclement, makes one free
to act as the servitor of the Lord, even though one is in the material world.
This stage is called jivanmukta stage, or the liberated stage, even in the


--- Page 163 ---
824 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 15
material world. That is the process of ending material existence. One must
not only think that he is Brahman, but he must act like Brahman. One who
only thinks himself Brahman is an impersonalist. And one who acts like
Brahman is the pure devotee.

no occupation. He did not depend on his brothers for anything. And, just
like a deaf man, he heard nothing.

Thus being freed from all external affairs, he had nothing to do with
imperial life or family prestige, and for all practical purposes he posed
himself exactly like an inert mad urchin and did not speak of material

He then started towards the North, treading the path which was

that way wherever he went.
PURPORT

It is understood from this verse that Maharaja Yudhisthira followed in
the footsteps of his forefathers and the great devotees of the Lord. We
have discussed many times before that the system of varpasrama-dharma,
as it was strictly followed by the inhabitants of the world, specifically by
those who inhabited the Aryavarta province of the world, emphasizes the
importance of leaving all household connections at a certain stage of life.
The training and education was so imparted, and thus a respectable person
like Maharaja Yudhisthira must leave all family connection for self-
realization and going back to Godhead. No king or respectable gentleman
would continue family life till the end because that was considered suicidal


--- Page 165 ---
826 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 15
and against the interest of the perfection of human life. In order to be free
from all family encumbrances and devote oneself cent percent in the
devotional service of Lord Krsna, this system is always recommended
for everyone because it is the path of authority. The Lord instructs in the
Bhagavad-gita (Bg. 18.62) that one must become a devotee of the Lord at
least at the last stage of one’s life. A sincere soul of the Lord like Maharaja
Yudhisthira must abide by this instruction of the Lord for his own interest.
The specific words Brahman Param indicate Lord Sri Krsna. This is
corroborated in the Bhagavad-gita (Bg. 10.12) by Arjuna with reference to
great authorities like Asita, Devala, Narada, Vyasa, etc. Thus Maharaja
Yudhisthira, while leaving home for the North, constantly remembered
Lord Sri Krsna within himself, following in the footsteps of his forefathers
as well as the great devotees of all times.

The younger brothers of Maharaja Yudhisthira observed that the age of

cided to follow in the footsteps of their elder brother.
PURPORT
The younger brothers of Maharaja Yudhisthira were already obedient
followers of the great Emperor, and they had sufficiently been trained to
know the ultimate goal of life. They therefore decidedly followed their
eldest brother in rendering devotional service to Lord Sri Krsna. According


--- Page 166 ---
Text 46] The Pandavas Retire Timely 827
to the principles of sanatana-dharma, one must retire from family life
after half the duration of life is finished and must engage himself in self-
realization. But the question of engaging oneself is not always decided.
Sometimes retired men are bewildered about how to engage themselves for
the last days of life. Here is a decision by authorities like the Pandavas. All
of them engaged themselves in culturing favorably the devotional service
of Lord Sri Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. According to
Svami Sridhara, dharma, artha, kama and moksa, or fruitive activities,
philosophical speculations or salvation, as conceived by several persons,
are not the ultimate goal of life. They are more or less practiced by
persons who have no information of the ultimate goal of life. The ultimate
goal of life is already indicated by the Lord Himself in the Bhagavad-gita
(Bg. 18.64), and the Pandavas were intelligent enough to follow it without
hesitation.

They all had performed all the principles of religion and as a result

done pious deeds in previous lives and have become freed from the results

of all impious acts can concentrate upon the lotus feet of the Supreme
Lord Sri Krsna. The Pandavas, not only in this life but also in their
previous lives, had always performed the supreme pious work, and thus
they are ever free from all the reactions of impious work. It is quite
reasonable, therefore, that they concentrated their minds unto the lotus
feet of the Supreme Lord Sri Krsna. According to Sri Visvanatha Cakravarti,
dharma, artha, kama and moksa principles are accepted by persons who
are not free from the results of impious action. Such persons affected with
the contaminations of the above four principles cannot at once accept the
lotus feet of the Lord in the spiritual sky. The Vaikuntha world is situated
far beyond the material sky. The material sky is under the management of
Durga Devi, or the material energy of the Lord, but the Vaikuntha world
is managed by the personal energy of the Lord.

TRANSLATION
Thus by pure consciousness due to constant devotional remembrance,
they attained the spiritual sky which is ruled over by the Supreme
Narayana Lord Krsna. This is attained only by those who meditate upon
the one Supreme Lord without deviation. This abode of the Lord Sri
Krsna, known as Goloka Vrndavana, cannot be attained by persons who
are absorbed in the material conception of life. But the Pandavas, being
completely washed of all material contamination, attained that abode in
their very same bodies.
PURPORT
According to Srila Jiva Gosvami, a person freed from the three modes
of material qualities, namely goodness, passion and ignorance, and situated
in transcendence can reach the highest perfection of life without change
of body. Srila Sanitana Gosvami in his Hari-bhakti-vildsa says that a
person, whatever he may be, can attain the perfection of a twice-born
brahmana by undergoing the spiritual disciplinary actions under the
guidance of a bona fide spiritual master, exactly as a chemist can turn gun
metal into gold by chemical manipulation. It is, therefore, the actual
guidance that matters in the process of becoming a brahmana, even with-
out change of body, or in going back to Godhead without change of body.
Srila Jiva Gosvami remarks that the word “hi” used in this connection
positively affirms this truth, and there is no doubt about this factual
position. The Bhagavad-gita also affirms this statement of Srila Jiva
Gosvami when the Lord says (Bg. 14.26) that anyone who executes devo-
tional service systematically without deviation can attain the perfection
of Brahman by surpassing the contamination of the three modes of mate-
rial nature, and when the Brahman perfection is still more advanced by
the selfsame execution of devotional service, there is no doubt at all that
one can attain the supreme spiritual planet Goloka Vrndavana without
change of body, as we have already discussed in connection with the
Lord’s returning to His abode without a change of body.

TRANSLATION
Vidura, while on pilgrimage, left his body at Prabhasa. Because he was
absorbed in thought of Lord Krsna, he was received by the denizens of the
Pitrloka planet where he returned to his original post.
PURPORT
The difference between the Pandavas and Vidura is that the Pandavas
are eternal associates of the Lord Personality of Godhead, whereas Vidura
is one of the administrative demigods in charge of the Pitrloka planet and
is known as Yamaraja. Men are afraid of Yamaraja because it is he only who
awards punishment to the miscreants of the material world, but those who
are devotees of the Lord have nothing to fear from him. To the devotees
he is a cordial friend, but to the nondevotees he is fear personified. As we
have already discussed, it is understood that Yamaraja was cursed by
Manduka Muni to be degraded as a $iidra, and therefore Vidura was an
incarnation of Yamardja. As eternal servitor of the Lord, he displayed his
devotional activities very ardently and lived a life of a pious man, so much
so that a materialistic man like Dhrtarastra also got salvation by his
instruction. So by his pious activities in devotional service of the Lord he
was able to remember always the lotus feet of the Lord, and thus he
became washed of all contamination of a s$iidra-born life. At the end he
was again received by the denizens of Pitrloka and posted in his original
position. The demigods are also associates of the Lord without personal
touch, whereas the direct associates of the Lord are in constant personal
touch with Him. The Lord and His personal associates incarnate in many
universes without cessation. The Lord remembers them all, whereas the


--- Page 170 ---
Text 50] The Pandavas Retire Timely 831
associates forget due to their being very minute parts and parcels of the
Lord; they are apt to forget such incidences due to being infinitesimal.
This is corroborated in the Bhagavad-gita (Bg. 4.5).

TRANSLATION
Draupadi also saw that her husbands, without caring for her, were
leaving home. She knew well about Lord Vasudeva, Krsna, the Personality
of Godhead. Both she and Subhadra became absorbed in thoughts of
Krsna and attained the same results as their husbands.
PURPORT

When flying an airplane in outer space, one cannot take care of other
planes. Everyone has to take care of his own plane, and if there is any
danger, no other plane can help another in that condition. Similarly, at the
end of life when one has to go back to home, back to Godhead, everyone
has to take care of himself without help rendered to another. The help is,
however, offered on ground before flying in space. Similarly, the spiritual
master, the father, the mother, the relatives, the husband, etc., can all
render help during one’s lifetime, but while crossing the sea one has to
take care of himself and utilize the instructions formerly received. Draupadi
had five husbands, and no one asked Draupadi to come, but Draupadi had
to take care of herself without waiting for her great husbands. And because


--- Page 171 ---
832 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 15
she was already trained up, she at once took to the concentration of the
lotus feet of Lord Vasudeva, Krsna, the Personality of Godhead. The wives
also got the same result as their husbands in the same manner, that is to
say that without changing the body they reached the destination of
back to Godhead. Srila Vigvanatha Cakravarti Thakur suggests that both
Draupadi and Subhadra, although her name is not mentioned herein, got
the same result. None of them had to quit the body.

TRANSLATION
The subject of the departure of the sons of Pandu for the ultimate goal
of life, back to Godhead, is fully auspicious and is perfectly pure.
Therefore anyone who hears this narration with devotional faith certainly
gains devotional service of the Lord, the highest perfection of life.
PURPORT
Srimad-Bhagavatam is a narration about the Personality of Godhead and
of the devotees of the Lord like the Pandavas and others. The narration
of the Personality of Godhead and His devotees is absolute in itself, and


--- Page 172 ---
Text 51] The Pandavas Retire Timely 833
thus to hear it with a devotional attitude is to associate with the Lord and
constant companions of the Lord. By the hearing process of Srimad-
Bhigavatam one can attain the highest perfection of life, namely going
back home, back to Godhead, without failure.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fifteenth Chapter, First
Canto, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “The Papdavas Retire Timely.”

835


--- Page 174 ---
836 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 16
PURPORT

At the time of Maharaja Parlksit’s birth, the expert astrologer brahmanas
foretold some of his qualities. Maharaja Pariksit developed all those quali-
ties, being a great devotee of the Lord. The real qualification is to become
a devotee of the Lord, and gradually all the good qualities worthy of
possession develop. Maharaja Pariksit was a mahabhagavata, or a first-class
devotee, who was not only well versed in the science of devotion but also
able to convert others to become devotees by his transcendental instruc-
tions. Maharaja Pariksit was, therefore, a devotee of the first order, and
thus he used to consult great sages and learned brahmanas who could advise
him by the sastras how to execute the state administration. Such great
kings were more responsible than modern elected executive heads because
they obliged the great authorities by following their instructions left in
Vedic literatures. There was no need to enact daily a new legislative bill by
impractical fools and to alter it again and again conveniently to serve some
purpose. The rules and regulations were already set forth by great sages
like Manu, Yajfiavalkya, Parasara and other liberated sages, and the enact-
ments were all suitable for all ages in all places. Therefore the rules and
regulations were standard and without flaw or defect. Kings like Maharaja
Pariksit had their council of advisers, and all the members of that council
were either great sages or brahmanas of the first order. They did not accept
any salary, nor had they any necessity for such salaries. The state would
get the best advice without expenditure. They were themselves samadarsi,
equal to everyone, both man and animal. They would not advise the king
to give protection to man and instruct him to kill the poor animals. Such
council members were not fools or representatives to compose a fool’s
paradise. They were all self-realized souls, and they knew perfectly well
how all living beings in the state would be happy, both in this life and the
next. They were not concerned with the hedonistic philosophy of eat, drink,
be merry and enjoy. They were philosophers in the real sense, and they
knew well what is the mission of human life. Under all these obligations,
the advisory council of the king would give correct directions, and the
king or executive head, being himself a qualified devotee of the Lord,
would scrutinizingly follow them for the welfare of the state. The state in
the days of Maharaja Yudhisthira or Maharaja Pariksit was a welfare state
in the real sense of the term because no one was unhappy in that state, be
he man or animal. Maharaja Pariksit was an ideal king for a welfare state
of the world.

TRANSLATION
King Pariksit married the daughter of King Uttara and begot four sons
headed by Maharaja Janamejaya.
त PURPORT

Maharaja Uttara was the son of Virata and maternal uncle of Maharaja
Pariksit. Iravati, being the daughter of Maharaja Uttara, was the cousin
sister of Maharaja Pariksit, but cousin brothers and sisters were allowed to
get married if they did not belong to the same gotra or family. In the
Vedic system of marriage, the importance of the gotra or family was
stressed. Arjuna also married Subhadra, although she was his maternal
cousin sister.

Janamejaya. One of the rajarsi kings and the famous son of Maharaja
Pariksit. His mother’s name is Iravati, or according to some, Madravati.
Maharaja Janamejaya begot two sons of the names Jiiatanika and Sanku-
karna. He celebrated several sacrifices in the Kuruksetra pilgrimage, and he
had three younger brothers named Srutasena, Ugrasena and Bhimasena II.
He invaded Taxsila (Ajanta), and he decided to avenge the unlawful curse
upon his great father Maharaja Pariksit. He performed a great sacrifice
called Sarpa yajiia to kill the race of serpents, including the Taksaka,
which had bitten his father to death. On request from many influential
demigods and sages, he had to change his decision to kill the race of snakes,
but despite stopping the sacrifice, he satisfied everyone concerned in the


--- Page 176 ---
838 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 16
sacrifice by rewarding them properly and stopping further procedure of the
sacrifice. In the ceremony, Mahamuni Vyasadeva also was present, and he
personally narrated the history of the Battle of Kuruksetra before the
King. Later on by the order of Vy&sadeva, his disciple Vaisampayana
narrated before the King the subject matter of Mahabharata. He was much
affected by his great father’s untimely death and was very anxious to see
him again, and he expressed his desire before the great sage Vyasadeva.
Vyasadeva also fulfilled his desire. His father was present before him, and
he worshiped both his father and Vyasadeva with great respect and pomp.
Being fully satisfied, he made charities most munificently to the brahmanas
present in the sacrifice.

Maharaja Pariksit, after having selected Krpacarya for guidance as his
spiritual master, performed three horse sacrifices on the banks of the
Ganges. These were executed with sufficient rewards for the attendants.
And at these sacrifices, even the common man could see demigods.
PURPORT
It appears from this verse that interplanetary travel by the denizens
of higher planets is easy. In many statements in Bhagavatam, we have
observed that the demigods from heaven used to visit this earth to attend


--- Page 177 ---
Text 4] How Paciksit Received the Age of Kali 839
sacrifices performed by influential kings and emperors. Herein also we find
that during the time of the horse sacrifice ceremony of Maharaja Pariksit,
the demigods from other planets were visible even for the common man
due to the sacrificial ceremony. The demigods are not generally visible to
common men, as the Lord is not visible. But as the Lord also, by His
causeless mercy, descends to be visible to the common man, similarly the
demigods also become visible to the common man by their own grace.
Although celestial beings are not visible to the naked eyes of the inhabitants
of this earth, it was due to the influence of Maharija Pariksit that the
demigods also agreed to be visible. The kings used to spend lavishly during
such sacrifices, as a cloud distributes rains. A cloud is nothing but another
form of water, or, in other words, the waters of the earth transform into
clouds. Similarly, the charity made by the kings in such sacrifices are but
another form of the taxes collected from the citizens. But, as the rains
fall down very lavishly and appear to be more than necessary, the charity
made by such kings also seems to be more than what the citizen needs.
Satisfied citizens will never organize agitation against the king, and thus
there was no need in changing the monarchial state.

Even for a king like Maharaja Yudhisthira there was need of a spiritual
master for guidance. Without such guidance one cannot make progress in
spiritual life. The spiritual master must be bona fide, and one who wants
to have self-realization must approach and take shelter of a bona fide
spiritual master to achieve real success.

840 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 16
TRANSLATION
Once, when Maharaja Pariksit was on his way to conquer the world,
he saw the master of Kali-yuga, who was lower than a 80013, disguised as a
king and hurting the legs of a cow and bull. The King at once caught hold
of him to deal sufficient punishment.
PURPORT
The purpose of a king’s going out to conquer the world is not for
self-aggrandizement. Maharaja Pariksit went out to conquer the world
after his ascendance on the throne, but this was not for the purpose of
aggression on other states. He was the Emperor of the world, and all small
states were already under his regime. His purpose in going out was to see
how things were going on in terms of the godly state. The king, being the
representative of the Lord, has to execute the will of the Lord duly.
There is no question of self-aggrandizement. Thus as soon as Maharaja
Pariksit saw that a lower class man in the dress of a king was hurting the
legs of a cow and a bull, at once he arrested and punished him. The king
cannot tolerate insults to the most important animal, the cow, nor can he
tolerate disrespect for the most important man, the brahmanpa. Human
civilization means to advance the cause of brahminical culture, and to
maintain it, cow protection is essential. There is a miracle in milk, for it
contains all the necessary vitamins to sustain human physiological con-
ditions for higher achievements. Brahminical culture can only be advanced
when man is educated to develop the quality of goodness, and for this
there is prime necessity of food prepared with milk, fruits and grains.
Maharaja Pariksit was astonished to see that a black §itdra, dressed like
a ruler, was mistreating a cow, the most important animal in human society.
The age of Kali means mismanagement and quarrel. And the root cause
of all mismanagement and quarrel is that worthless men with the modes of
lower class men, who have no higher ambition in life, come to the helm of
the state management. Such men at the post of a king are sure to hurt
first the cow and the brahminical culture and thereby to push all society
towards hell. Maharaja Pariksit, trained as he was, got the scent of this
root cause of all quarrel in the world. Thus he wanted to stop it in the
very beginning.

Saunaka Rsi inquired: Why did Maharaja Pariksit simply punish him,
since he was the lowest of the इता, having dressed as a king and harmed
the legs of a cow? Please describe all these incidences as they relate to the
topics of Lord Krsna.
PURPORT
Saunaka and the rsis were astonished to hear that the pious Maharaja
Pariksit simply punished the culprit and did not kill him. This suggests
that a pious king like Maharaja Pariksit should have at once killed an
offender who wanted to cheat the public, being dressed like a king and at
the same time daring to insult the purest of the animals, a cow! The rsis in
those days, however, could not even imagine that in the advanced days of
the age of Kali the lowest of the siidras will be elected as administrators
and will open organized slaughterhouses for killing cows. Anyway, although
hearing about a Sidraka who was a cheat and insulter of a cow was not
very interesting to the great rsis, they nevertheless wanted to hear about it
to see if the event had any connection with Lord Krsna. They were
simply interested in the topics of Lord Krsna, for anything that is dove-


--- Page 180 ---
842 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 16
tailed with the narration of Krsna is worth hearing. There are many
topics in the Bhagavatam about sociology, politics, economy, cultural
affairs, etc., but all of them are in relation with Krsna, and therefore all of
them are worth hearing. Krsna is the purifying ingredient in all matters,
regardless of what they are. In the mundane world, everything is impure
due to its being a product of the three mundane qualities. The purifying
agent is, however, Krsna.

TRANSLATION
The devotees of the Lord are accustomed to licking up the honey
available from the lotus feet of the Lord. What is the use of topics which
simply waste one’s valuable life?
PURPORT

Lord Krsna and His devotees are both on the transcendental plane;
therefore the topics of Lord Krsna or of His pure devotees are equally
good. The Battle of Kuruksetra is full of politics and diplomacy, but
because the topics are related with Lord Krsna, the Bhagavad-gita is
therefore adored all over the world. There is no need to eradicate politics,
economics, sociology, etc., which are mundane to the mundaners. To a
pure devotee who is actually related with the Lord, such mundane things
are transcendental if dovetailed with the Lord or with His pure devotee.


--- Page 181 ---
Text 7] How Pariksit Received the Age of Kali 843
We have so far heard and talked about the activities of the Pandavas, and
we are dealing with the topics of Maharaja Pariksit, but because all these
topics are related with the Lord Sri Krsna, they are all transcendental,
and pure devotees have great interest in hearing them. We have already
discussed this matter in connection with the prayers of Bhismadeva.

Our duration of life is not very long, and there is no certainty when we
shall be ordered to leave everything for the next stage. Thus it is our duty
to see that not a moment of our life is wasted in topics which are not
related with Lord Krsna. Any topic, however pleasant, is not worth
hearing if it is devoid of its relation of Krsna.

The spiritual planet, Goloka Vrndavana, eternal abode of Lord Krsna,
is shaped like the whorl of a lotus flower. Even when the Lord descends
on any one of the mundane planets, He does so by manifesting His own
abode as it is. Thus His feet remain always on the same big whorl of
lotus flower. His feet are also as beautiful as the lotus flower. Therefore
it is said that Lord Krsna has lotus feet.

A living being is eternal by constitution. He is, so to speak, in the whirl-
pool of birth and death due to his contact with material energy. Freed
from such material energy, a living entity is liberated and is eligible to
return back home, back to Godhead. Those who want to live forever
without changing their material body should not waste valuable time with
topics other than those relating to Lord Krsna and His devotees.

TRANSLATION
0 Sata Gosvami, there are those amongst men who desire freedom
from death and get eternal life. They escape the slaughtering process by
calling the controller of death, Yamaraja.
PURPORT
The living entity, as he develops from lower animal life to a higher
human being and gradually to higher intelligence, becomes anxious to get
freed from the clutches of death. Modern scientists try to avoid death by
physiochemical advancement of knowledge, but alas the controller of
death, Yamaraja, is so cruel that he does not spare even the very life of the
scientist himself. The scientist, who puts forward the theory of stopping
death by advancement of scientific knowledge, becomes himself a victim
of death when he is called by Yamaraja. What to speak of stopping death,
no one can even enhance the short period of life even by a fraction of a
moment. The only hope of suspending the cruel slaughtering process of
Yamaraja is to call him to hear and chant the holy name of the Lord.
Yamaraja is a great devotee of the Lord, and he likes to be invited to
kirtanas and sacrifices by the pure devotees who are constantly engaged in
the devotional service of the Lord. Thus the great sages, headed by Saunaka
and others, invited Yamarija to attend the sacrifice performed at
Naimisaranya. This was good for those who did not want to die.

TRANSLATION
As long as Yamaraja, who causes everyone’s death, is present here, no
one shall meet with death. The great sages have invited the controller of
death, Yamaraja, who is the representative of the Lord. Living beings who
are under his grip should take advantage by hearing the deathless nectar
in the form of this narration of the transcendental pastimes of the Lord.
PURPORT
Every human being does not like to meet death, but he does not know
how to get rid of death. The surest remedy for avoiding death is to get
oneself accustomed to hearing the nectarean pastimes of the Lord as they
are systematically narrated in the text of Srimad-Bhagavatam. It is advised

846 Srimad-Bhigavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 16
PURPORT
The less intelligent do not know the real value of the human form of
life. The human form is a special gift of material nature in the course of
her enforcing stringent laws of miseries upon the living being. It is a chance
to achieve the highest boon of life, namely to get out of the entanglement
of repeated birth and death. The intelligent take care of this important
gift by strenuously endeavoring to get out of the entanglement. But the
less intelligent are lazy and unable to evaluate the gift of the human body
to achieve liberation from the material bondage; they become more inter-
ested in so-called economic development and work very hard throughout
life simply for the sense enjoyment of the temporary body. Sense enjoy-
ment is also allowed to the lower animals by the law of nature, and thus a
human being is also destined to a certain amount of sense enjoyment
according to his past or present life. But one should definitely try to
understand that sense enjoyment is not the ultimate goal of human life.
Herein it is said that during the daytime one works “for nothing” because
the aim is nothing but sense enjoyment. We can particularly observe how
the human being is engaged for nothing in great cities and industrial towns.
There are so many things manufactured by human energy, but they are all
meant for sense enjoyment, and not for getting out of the material
bondage. And after working hard during the daytime, a tired man either
sleeps or engages in sex habits at night. That is the program of materialistic
civilized life for the less intelligent. Therefore they are designated herein
as lazy, unfortunate and short-lived.

TRANSLATION

Siita Gosvami said: While Maharaja Pariksit was residing in the capital
of the Kuru empire, the symptoms of the age of Kali began to infiltrate
within the jurisdiction of his state. When he learned about this, he did not
think the matter very palatable. This did, however, give him a chance to
fight. He took up his bow and arrows and prepared himself for military
activities.

PURPORT

The state administration of Maharaja Pariksit was so perfect that he was
sitting in his capital peacefully. But he got the news that the symptoms of
the age of Kali had already infiltrated into the jurisdiction of his state,
and he did not like this news. What are the symptoms of the age of Kali?
They are 1) illicit connection with women, 2) indulgence in meat-eating,
3) intoxication, and 4) taking pleasure in gambling. The age of Kali literally
means the age of quarrel, and the above-mentioned four symptoms in
human society are the root causes for all kinds of quarrel. Maharaja
Pariksit heard that some of the people of the state already had taken to
those symptoms, and he wanted to take immediate steps against such
causes of unrest. This means that at least up to the regime of Maharaja
Pariksit, such symptoms of public life were practically unknown, and as
soon as they were slightly detected, he wanted to root them out. The news
was not palatable for him, but in a way it was because Maharaja Pariksit
got a chance to fight. There was no need to fight with small states because
everyone was peacefully under his subordination, but the Kali-yuga mis-
creants gave his fighting spirit a chance for exhibition. A perfect ksatriya
king is always jubilant as soon as he gets a chance to fight, just as a
sportsman is eager when there is a chance for a sporting match. It is no
argument that in the age of Kali such symptoms were predestined. If so,
then why was there preparation for fighting out such symptoms? Such
arguments are offered by lazy and unfortunate men. In the rainy season,


--- Page 186 ---
848 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 16
rain is predestined, and yet people take precautions to protect themselves.
Similarly, in the age of Kali the symptoms as above mentioned are sure to
infiltrate into social life, but it is the duty of the state to save the citizens
from the association of the agents of the age of Kali. Maharaja Pariksit
wanted to punish the miscreants indulging in the symptoms of Kali, and
thus save the innocent citizens who were pure in habit by culture of
religion. It is the duty of the king to give such protection, and Maharaja
Pariksit was perfectly right when he prepared himself to fight.

Maharaja Pariksit is distinguished from his grandfather Arjuna, for black
horses pulled his chariot instead of white horses. He marked his flag with

the mark of a lion, and his grandfather marked his with the mark of Hanu-
manji. A royal procession like that of Maharaja Pariksit surrounded by
well-decorated chariots, cavalry, elephants, infantry and band is not only
pleasing to the eyes, but also is a sign of a civilization that is aesthetic
even on the fighting front.

TRANSLATION
Maharaja Pariksit then conquered all parts of the earthly planet—
Bhadrasva, Ketumala, Bharata, the Northern portion of Kurujangala, Kim-
purusa, etc.—and exacted tributes from their respective rulers.
PURPORT

Bhadrasva: It is an island near Meru Parvata. There is a description of this
island in the Mahabharata (Bhisma Parva 7/16-18). The description was
narrated by Saifijaya 10 Dhrtarastra.

Maharaja Yudhisthira also conquered this island, and thus the province
was included within the jurisdiction of his empire. Maharaja Pariksit was
formerly declared to be the emperor of all lands ruled by his grandfather,
but still he had to establish his supremacy while he was out of his capital
to exact tribute from such states.

Ketumala: This earth planet is divided into seven parts, and according
to others it is divided into nine parts. This earth is called Jambiidvipa, and
is divided into nine varsas. Bharatavarsa is one of the above-mentioned nine


--- Page 188 ---
850 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 16
vargas. Such varsas are known as continents in the modern geographical
context. Ketumala is described as one of the above varsas. It is said that in
this varsa, women are the most beautiful. This varsa was conquered by
Arjuna also. A description of this part of the world is available in the
Mahabharata (Sabha 28.6).

It is said that this part of the world is situated on the western side of
the Meru Parvata, and inhabitants of this province used to live up to ten
thousands of years (Bhisma Parva 6.16.31-32). Human beings living in this
part of the globe are of golden color, and the women resemble the angels
of heaven. The inhabitants are free from all kinds of diseases and griefs.

Bharatavarsa: This part of the world is also one of the nine varsas of the
Jambudvipa or earthly planet. Each planet is also sometimes called a
dvipa because of its being an island in the fathomless outer space. Each
planet is factually an island in the airy ocean of outer space. Jambudvipa
is only one of such countless islands in this airy ocean of space. A
description of Bharatavarsa is given in the Mahabharata (Bhisma Parva,
Chapters 9 to 10).

Uttaran: According to Sridhara Svami these parts of the world are
called Ilavartavarsa, or the Mediterranean countries of Europe. The
description of the Ilavartavarsa is given in the Mahabharata (Sabha 28.6-7)
as follows:

nagaras ca vanarh ca va nadi§ ca vimalodakah
purusan deva-kalpars ca priya-darsanah

adrsta-parvan subhagan sa dadarsa dhanaiijayah
sadanari ca $ubhrani naris ca apserasam-nibha

It is twice mentioned here that the women are beautiful, and some of
them are equal to the apsaras or heavenly women. Therefore the countries
mentioned are round about the Mediterranean coast.

Kimpurusavarsa: It is stated to be situated beyond the northern side of
Darjelling Dhavala Giri and probably may be a country like Nepal, Bhutan,
Tibet and China. These parts of the world were also conquered by Arjuna
(Sabha 28/1-2). The Kimpurusas are descendants of the daughter of
Daksa. When Maharaja Yudhisthira performed a horse sacrifice yajiia, the
inhabitants of these countries were also present to take part in the festival,
and they paid tributes to the emperor. This part of the world is called
Kimpurusavarsa, or sometimes the Himalayan provinces (Himavati). It is
said that Sukadeva Gosvami was born in these Himalayan provinces, and
he came to Bharatavarsa after crossing the Himalayan countries.

TRANSLATION

Wherever the King visited, he continuously heard the glories of his
great forefathers, who were all devotees of the Lord, and also of the
glorious acts of Lord Krsna. He also heard how he himself had been pro-
tected by the Lord from the powerful heat of the weapon of Asvatthama.
People also mentioned the great affection between the descendants of
Vrsni and Prtha due to the latter’s great devotion to Lord Kesava. The
King, being very pleased with the singers of such glories, opened his eyes
in great satisfaction. Out of magnanimity he was pleased to award them
very valuable necklaces and clothing.

PURPORT

Kings and great personalities of the state are presented with welcome
addresses. This is a system from time immemorial, and Maharaja Pariksit,
since he was one of the well-known emperors of the world, was also pre-
sented with addresses of welcome in all parts of the world as he visited
those places. The subject matter of those welcome addresses was Krsna.
Krsna means Krsna and His eternal devotees, as the king means the king
and his confidential associates.

Krsna and His unalloyed devotees cannot be separated, and therefore
glorifying the devotee means glorifying the Lord and vice versa. Maharaja
Pariksit would not have been glad to hear about the glories of his fore-
fathers like Maharaja Yudhisthira and Arjuna, etc., had they not been
connected with the acts of Lord Krsna. The Lord descends specifically to
deliver His devotees (paritranaya sadhiinarn). The devotees are glorified by
the presence of the Lord because they cannot live for a moment without
the presence of the Lord and His different energies. The Lord is present
for the devotee by His acts and glories, and therefore Maharaja Pariksit
felt the presence of the Lord when He was glorified by His acts, especially
when he was saved by the Lord in the womb of his mother. The devotees
of the Lord are never in danger, but in the material world which is full of
dangers in every step, the devotees are apparently placed into dangerous
positions, and when they are saved by the Lord, the Lord is glorified.
Lord Krsna would not have been glorified as the speaker of the Bhagavad-
gita had His devotees like the Pandavas not been entangled in the Battle-


--- Page 191 ---
Text 16] How Pariksit Received the Age of Kali 853
field of Kuruksetra. All such acts of the Lord were mentioned in the
addresses of welcome, and Maharaja Pariksit, in full satisfaction, rewarded
those who presented such addresses. The difference between the presenta-
tion of welcome addresses today and in those days is that formerly the
welcome addresses were presented to a_person like Maharaja Pariksit. The
welcome addresses were full of facts and figures, and those who presented
such addresses were sufficiently rewarded, whereas in the present days the
welcome address is presented not always with factual statements but to
please the postholder, and often they are full of flattering lies. And rarely
are those who present such welcome addresses rewarded by the poor
receiver.

Maharaja Pariksit heard that out of His causeless mercy Lord Krsna
[Visnu], who is universally obeyed, rendered all kinds of service to the

malleable sons of Pandu by accepting posts ranging from chariot driver to
president to messenger, friend, night watchman, etc., according to the will
of the Pandavas, obeying them like a servant and offering obeisances like
one younger in years. When he heard this, Maharaja Pariksit became over-
whelmed with devotion to the lotus feet of the Lord.
PURPORT

Lord Krsna is everything to the unalloyed devotees like the Pandavas.
The Lord was for them the Supreme Lord, the spiritual master, the wor-
shipable Deity, the guide, the chariot driver, the friend, the servant, the
messenger and everything they could conceive of. And thus the Lord also
reciprocated the feeling of the Pandavas. Maharaja Pariksit, as a pure
devotee of the Lord, could appreciate the Lord’s transcendental recipro-
cation of the feelings of His devotees, and thus he himself also was over-
whelmed with the dealings of the Lord. Simply by appreciating the dealings
of the Lord with His pure devotees, one can attain salvation. The Lord’s
dealings with His devotees appear to be ordinary human dealings, but one
who knows them in truth becomes at once eligible to go back home, back
to Godhead. The Pandavas were so malleable to the will of the Lord that
they could sacrifice any amount of energy for the service of the Lord, and
by such unalloyed determination they could secure the Lord’s mercy in
any shape they desired.

TRANSLATION
The personality of religious principles, Dharma, was wandering about
in the form of a bull. And he met the personality of earth in the form of a
cow who appeared to grieve like a mother who had lost her child. She had
tears in her eyes, and the beauty of her body was lost. Thus Dharma
questioned the earth as follows.
PURPORT

The bull is the emblem of the moral principle, and the cow is the repre-
sentative of the earth. When the bull and the cow are in a joyful mood, it
is to be understood that the people of the world are also in a joyful mood.
The reason is that the bull helps production of grains in the agricultural
field, and the cow delivers milk, the miracle of aggregate food values. The
human society, therefore, maintains these two important animals very
carefully so that they can wander everywhere in cheerfulness. But at the


--- Page 194 ---
856 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 16
present moment in this age of Kali both the bull and the cow are now
being slaughtered and eaten up as foodstuff by a class of men who do not
know the brahminical culture. The bull and the cow can be protected
for the good of all human society simply by spreading brahminical culture
as the topmost perfection of all cultural affairs. By advancement of such
culture, the morale of society is properly maintained, and so peace and
prosperity are also attained without extraneous effort. When brahminical
culture deteriorates, the cow and bull are mistreated, and the resultant
actions are prominent by the following symptoms.

--- Page 195 ---
Text 20] How Pariksit Received the Age of Kali 857
PURPORT
The people of the world in this age of Kali are always full of anxieties.
Everyone is diseased with some kind of ailment. From the very faces of the
people of this age, one can find out the index of the mind. Everyone feels
the absence of his relative who is away from home. The particular symptom
of the age of Kali is that no family is now blessed to live together. To earn
a livelihood, the father lives at a place far away from the son, or the wife
lives far away from the husband and so on. There are sufferings from
internal diseases, separation from those near and dear, and anxieties for
maintaining the status quo. These are but some important factors which
make the people of this age always unhappy.

--- Page 196 ---
858 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 16
grieving for living beings because of their sufferings due to famine and
drought?

PURPORT

With the progress of the age of Kali, four things particularly, namely,
the duration of life, mercy, the power of recollection, and moral or
religious principles, will gradually diminish. Since Dharma, or the princi-
ples of religion, would be lost in the proportion of three out of four, the
symbolic bull was standing on oneleg only. When three fourths of the pop-
ulation of the whole world becomeirreligious, the situation is converted into
hell for the animals. In the age of Kali, godless civilizations will create so
many so-called religious societies in which the Personality of Godhead will
be directly or indirectly defied. And thus faithless societies of man will make
the world uninhabitable for the saner section of people. There are grada-
tions of human beings in terms of proportionate faith in the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. The first-class faithful men are the Vaisnavas and
the brahmanas, then the ksatriyas, then the vaisyas, then the sidras, then
the mlecchas, the Yavanas and at last the capdalas. The degradation of
the human instinct begins from the mlecchas, and the candala state of life
is the last word in human degradation. All the above terms mentioned in
the Vedic literatures are never meant for any particular community or
birth. They are different qualifications of human beings in general. There
is no question of birthright or community. One can acquire the respective
qualifications by one’s own efforts, and thus the son of a Vaisnava can
become a mleccha, or the son of a candala can become more than a
brahmana, all in terms of their association and intimate relation with the
Supreme Lord.

The meat-eaters are generally called mlecchas. But all meat-eaters are
not mlecchas. Those who accept meat in terms of scriptural injunctions
are not mlecchas, but those who accept meat without restriction are called
mlecchas. Beef is forbidden in the scriptures, and the bulls and cows are
offered special protection by followers of the Vedas. But in this age of
Kali, people will exploit the body of the bull and the cow as they like, and
thus they will invite sufferings of various types.

The people of this age will not perform any sacrifice. The mleccha
population will care very little for performances of sacrifices, although
performance of sacrificeis essential for persons who are materially engaged
in sense enjoyment. In the Bhagavad-gita performance of sacrifices is
strongly recommended (Bg. 3.14-16).


--- Page 197 ---
How Pariksit Received the Age of Kali 859

The living beings are created by the creator Brahma, and just to main-
tain the created living being progressively towards the path of back to
Godhead, the system of performing sacrifice is also created by him. The
system is that living beings live on the produce of grains and vegetables,
and by eating such foodstuff they get vital power of the body in the shape
of blood and semina, and from blood and semina one living being is able
to create other living beings. But the production of grains, grass, etc.,
becomes possible by rain, and this rain is made to shower properly by
performance of recommended sacrifices. Such sacrifices are directed by
the rites of the Vedas, namely Sama, Yajus, Rk and Atharva. In the Manu-
smrti it is recommended that by offering sacrifice on the altar of the fire,
the sun-god is pleased. When the sun-god is pleased, he properly collects
water from the sea, and thus sufficient clouds collect on the horizon and
rains fall. After sufficient rains fall, there is sufficient production of grains
for men and all animals, and thus there is energy in the living being for
progressive activity. The mlecchas, however, make plans to install slaugh-
terhouses for killing bulls and cows along with other animals, thinking that
they will prosper by increasing the number of factories and live on animal
food without caring for performance of sacrifices and production of grains.
But they must know that even for the animals they must produce grass
and vegetables, otherwise the animals cannot live. And to produce grass
for the animals, they must require sufficient rains. Therefore they have to
depend ultimately on the mercy of the demigods like the sun-god, Indra,
Candra, etc., and such demigods must be satisfied by performances of
sacrifice.

This material world is a sort of prison house, as we have several times
mentioned. The demigods are servants of the Lord to see to the proper
upkeep of the prison house. These demigods want to see that the rebel
living beings, who want to survive faithlessly, are gradually turned towards
the supreme power of the Lord. Therefore, the system of offering sacrifice
is recommended in the scriptures.

The materialistic men want to work hard and enjoy fruitive results for
sense enjoyment. Thus they are committing many types of sins at every
step of life. Those who are, however, consciously engaged in the devotional
service of the Lord are transcendental to all varieties of sin and virtue.
Their activities are free from the contamination of the three modes of
material nature. For the devotees there is no need for performance of
prescribed sacrifices because the very life of the devotee is a symbol of
sacrifice. But persons who are engaged in fruitive activities for sense
enjoyment must perform the prescribed sacrifices because that is the only


--- Page 198 ---
860 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 16
means to get free from the reaction of all sins committed by the fruitive
workers. Sacrifice is the means for counteracting such accumulated sins.
The demigods are pleased when such sacrifices are performed, just as
prison officers are satisfied when the prisoners are turned into obedient
subjects. Lord Caitanya, however, has recommended only one yajiia or
sacrifice, called the sankirtana-yajiia, the chanting of Hare Krsna, in which
everyone can take part. Thus both devotees and fruitive workers can
derive equal benefit from the performances of saitkirtana-yajiia.

PURPORT
In the age of Kali, the women and the children, along with brahmanas
and cows, will be grossly neglected and left unprotected. In this age, illicit
connection with women will render many women and children uncared
for. Circumstantially, the women will try to become independent of the
protection of men, and marriage will be performed as a matter of formal
agreement between man and woman. In most cases, the children will not
be taken care of properly. The brahmanas are traditionally intelligent
men, and thus they will be able to pick up modern education to the top-
most rank, but as far as moral and religious principles are concerned, they
shall be the most fallen. Education and bad character go ill together, but
such things will run parallel. The administrative heads as a class will con-
demn the tenets of Vedic wisdom and will prefer to conduct a so-called
secular state, and the so-called educated brahmanas will be purchased by
such unscrupulous administrators. Even a philosopher and writer of many
books on religious principles may also accept an exalted post in a govern-
ment which denies all the moral codes of the $astras. The brahmanas are
specifically restricted in accepting such service. But in this age they will not
only accept service, but they will do so even if it is of the meanest quality.
These are some of the symptoms of the Kali age which are harmful to the
general welfare of human society.

TRANSLATION
The so-called administrators are now bewildered by the influence of
this age of Kali, and thus they have put all state affairs into disorder. Are
you now lamenting this disorder? Now the general populace does not
follow the rules and regulations for eating, sleeping, drinking, mating, etc.,
and they are inclined to perform such anywhere and everywhere. Are you
unhappy because of this?
PURPORT
There are some necessities of life on a par with the lower animals, and
they are eating, sleeping, fearing and mating. These bodily demands are
both for the human being and the animals. But the human being has to
fulfill such desires, not like animals, but like a human being. A dog can
mate with a bitch before the public eyes without hesitation, but if a
human being does so the act will be considered a public nuisance and the
person will be criminally prosecuted. Therefore for the human being there
are some rules and regulations, even for fulfilling common demands. The
human society avoids such rules and regulations when it is bewildered by
the influence of the age of Kali. In this age, people are indulging in such
necessities of life without following the rules and regulations, and this
deterioration of social and moral rules is certainly lamentable because of
the harmful effects of such beastly behavior. In this age, the fathers and
the guardians are not happy with the behavior of their wards. They should
know that so many innocent children are victims of bad association
awarded by the influence of this age of Kali. We know from Srimad-
Bhagavatam that Ajamila, an innocent son of a brahmana, was walking
down a road and saw a Sidra pair sexually embraced. This attracted the
boy, and later on the boy became a victim of all debaucheries. From a
pure brahmana, he fell down to the position of a wretched urchin, and it
was all due to bad association. There was but one victim like Ajamila in
those days, but in this age of Kali the poor innocent students are daily
victims of cinemas which attract men only for sex indulgence. The so-called
administrators are all untrained in the affairs of a ksatriya. The ksatriyas
are meant for administration, as the brahmanas are meant for knowledge

and guidance. The word ksatriya-bandhu refers to the so-called administra-
tors or persons promoted to the post of the administrator without proper
training by culture and tradition. Nowadays they are promoted to such
exalted posts by the votes of people who are themselves fallen in the rules
and regulations of life. How can they select a proper man when they are
themselves fallen in the standard of life? Therefore, by the influence of the
age of Kali, everywhere, politically, socially or religiously, everything is
topsy-turvy, and therefore for the sane man it is all regrettable.

of those activities and feeling sorry in their absence.

The activities of the Lord included liberation, but they are more relish-
able than the pleasure derived from nirvana or liberation. According to

864 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 16
Srila Jiva Gosvami and Viévanatha Cakravarti Thakur, the word used here
is nirvana-vilambitani, that which minimizes the value of liberation. To
attain nirvana or liberation, one has to undergo a severe type of tapasya,
austerities, but the Lord is so merciful that He incarnates to diminish the
burden of the earth. Simply by remembering such activities, one can defy
the pleasure derived from nirvana and reach the transcendental abode of
the Lord to associate with Him, eternally engaged in His blissful loving
service.

tenance of the inhabitants, but also when the Lord descends on the earth,
the whole earth becomes so enriched with all kinds of opulences that even
the denizens of heaven worship it with all affection. But by the will of the
Lord, the whole earth can at once be changed. He can do and undo a thing
at His sweet will. Therefore no one should consider himself to be self-
sufficient or independent of the Lord.

all those questions. Once you too were maintained by your four legs and
increased happiness all over the universe by the mercy of the Lord.
PURPORT
The principles of religion are laid down by the Lord Himself, and the
executor of such laws is Dharmaraja or Yamaraja. Such principles work
fully in the age of Satya-yuga; in the Treta-yuga they are reduced by a
fraction of one fourth; in the Dvapara they are reduced to one half, and in


--- Page 204 ---
866 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1,Ch 16
the Kali-yuga they are reduced to one fourth, gradually diminishing to the
zero point, and then devastation takes place. Happiness in the world
depends proportionately on the maintenance of the religious principles,
individually or collectively. The best part of valor is to maintain the
principles despite all kinds of odds. Thus one can be happy during the span
of life and ultimately return to Godhead.

voir of all goodness and beauty, Lord Sri Krsna, has now closed His tran-
scendental pastimes on the face of the earth. In His absence the age of Kali
has spread its influence everywhere, so I am sorry to see this condition of
existence.
PURPORT

Even if it were possible to count the atoms after smashing the earth into
powder, still it is not possible to estimate the unfathomed transcendental
qualities of the Lord. It is said that Lord Anantadeva has tried to expostu-
late the transcendental qualities of the Supreme Lord with his numberless
tongues, and that for numberless years together it has been impossible to
estimate the qualities of the Lord. The above statement of the qualities of
the Lord is just to estimate His qualities as far as a human being is able to
see Him. But even if it is so, the above qualities can also be divided into
many subheadings. According to Srila Jiva Gosvami, item No. 3 can be
subdivided into 1) protection of the surrendered souls, and 2) well wishes
for the devotees. In the Bhagavad-gita the Lord states that He wants every
soul to surrender unto Him only, and by doing so He assures everyone that
He will give protection from the reactions of all sins. Therefore unsurren-
dered souls are not devotees of the Lord, and thus there is no particular
protection for everyone in general. For the devotees He has all good wishes,
and for those who are actually engaged in the loving transcendental service
of the Lord, He gives particular attention. He gives direction to such pure
devotees to help them discharge their responsibilities on the path back to
Godhead. By equality (10), the Lord is equally kind to everyone, as the
sun is equal in distributing its rays over everyone. Yet there are many who
are unable to take advantage of the sun rays. Similarly, the Lord says that
surrendering unto Him is the guarantee for all protection from Him, but
unfortunate persons are unable to accept this proposition, and therefore
they suffer from all material miseries. So even though the Lord is equally
well wishing to everyone, the unfortunate living being, due to bad associa-
tion only, is unable to accept His instructions in toto, and for this the


--- Page 207 ---
Texts 26-30] How Paniksit Received the Age of Kali 869
Lord is never to be blamed. He is called the well-wisher for the devotees
only. He appears to be partial to His devotees, but factually the matter
rests on the living being to accept or reject equal treatment by the Lord.

The Lord never deviates from His word of honor. When He gives assur-
ance for protection, the promise is executed in all circumstances. It is the
duty of the pure devotee to be fixed up in the discharge of duty entrusted
to him by the Lord or the Lord’s bona fide representative, the spiritual
master. The rest is carried on by the Lord without a break.

Responsibility of the Lord is also unique. The Lord has no responsibility
because all His work is done by His different appointed energies. But still
He accepts voluntary responsibilities in displaying different roles in His
transcendental pastimes. As a boy, He was playing the part of a cowboy.
As the son of Nanda Maharaja, He discharged responsibility perfectly.
Similarly, when He was playing the part of a ksatriya as the son of
Maharaja Vasudeva, He displayed all the skill of a martially spirited ksatriya.
In almost all cases, the ksatriya king has to secure a wife by fighting or
kidnapping. This sort of behavior for a ksatriya is praiseworthy in the
sense that a ksatriya must show his power of chivalry before his would-be
wife so that the daughter of a ksatriya can see the valor of her would-be
husband. Even the Personality of Godhead Sri Rama displayed such a
spirit of chivalry during His marriage. He broke the strongest bow, called
Haradhanu, and achieved the hand of Sita Devi, the mother of all
opulence. The ksatriya spirit is displayed during marriage festivals, and
there is nothing wrong in such fighting. Lord Sri Krsna discharged such
responsibility fully because although He had more than 16,000 wives, in
each and every case He fought like a chivalrous ksatriya and thus secured
a wife. To fight 16,000 times to secure 16,000 wives is certainly only
possible by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly, He displayed
full responsibility in every action of His different transcendental pastimes.

Item No. 14, knowledge, can be further extended into five subheadings,
namely 1) intelligence, 2) gratefulness, 3) power of understanding the
circumstantial environments of place, object and time, 4) perfect know-
ledge of everything, and 5) knowledge of the self. Only fools are ungrateful
to their benefactors. The Lord, however, does not require benefit from
anyone besides Himself because He is full in Himself; still He feels bene-
fited by the unalloyed services of His devotees. The Lord feels grateful to
His devotees for such unsophisticated, unconditional service and tries to
reciprocate it by rendering service, although the devotee also has no such
desire in his heart. The transcendental service of the Lord is itself a tran-
scendental benefit for the devotee, and therefore the devotee has nothing


--- Page 208 ---
870 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 16
to expect from the Lord. On the assertion of the Vedic aphorism, sarvari
khalv 7007 brahma, we can understand that the Lord, by the omnipresent
rays of His effulgence, called brahmajyoti, is all-pervading inside or outside
of everything, like the omnipresent material sky, and thus He is also
omniscient.

As far as the beauty of the Lord is concerned, He has some special
features distinguished from all other living beings, and over and above that
He has some special attractive beautiful features by which He attracts the
mind of even Radharani, the supermost beautiful creation of the Lord. He
is known, therefore, as Madana-Mohana, or one who attracts the mind even
of Cupid. Srila Jiva Gosvimi Prabhu has scrutinizingly analyzed other
transcendental qualities of the Lord and affirms that Lord Sri Krsna is the
Absolute Supreme Personality of Godhead (Param Brahman). He is omni-
potent by His inconceivable energies, and therefore He is the Yogesvara or
the supreme master of all mystic powers. Being the Yogeévara, His eternal
form is spiritual, a combination of eternity, bliss and knowledge. The
nondevotee class cannot understand the dynamic nature of His knowledge
because they are satisfied to reach up to His eternal form of knowledge.
All great souls aspire to be equal in knowledge with Him. This means that
all other knowledge is ever insufficient, flexible and measurable, whereas
the knowledge of the Lord is ever fixed and unfathomable. Srila Siita
Gosvami affirms in the Bhagavatam that although He was observed by the
citizens of Dvaraka every day, they were ever increasingly anxious to see
Him again and again. The living being can appreciate the qualities of the
Lord as the ultimate goal, but they cannot attain the status quo of such
equality. This material world is a product of the mahat-tattva, which is a
state of the Lord’s dreaming condition in His Yoga-nidra mystic slumber
in the Causal Ocean, and yet the whole creation appears to be a factual
presentation of His creation. This means that the Lord’s dreaming condi-
tions are also factual manifestations. He can therefore bring everything
under His transcendental control, and thus whenever and wherever He does
appear, He does so in His fullness.

The Lord, being all that is described above, maintains the affairs of the
creation, and by His so doing He gives salvation even to His enemies who
are killed by Him. He is attractive even to the topmost liberated soul, and
thus He is worshipable even by Brahma and Siva, the greatest of all demi-
gods. Even in His incarnation of Purusavatara He is the Lord of the creative
energy. The creative material energy is working under His direction, as it
is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita (Bg. 9.10). He is the control switch of
the material energy, and to control the material energy in the innumerable


--- Page 209 ---
Text 31] How Pariksit Received the Age of Kali 871
universes, He is the root cause of innumerable incarnations in all the uni-
verses. There are more than 500,000 incarnations of Manu in only one
universe, besides other incarnations in different universes. In the spiritual
world, however, beyond the mahat-tattva, there is no question of incarna-
tions, but there are plenary expansions of the Lord in the different Vai-
kunthas. The planets in the spiritual sky are at least three times the number
of those within the innumerable universes in the mahat-tattva. And all the
Narayana forms of the Lord are but expansions of His Vasudeva feature,
and thus He is Vasudeva, Narayana and Krsna simultaneously. He is “sri-
krsna govinda hare murare, he natha narayana vasudeva,” all in one. His
qualities, therefore, cannot be counted by anyone, however great one may
be.

ishness, the whole system of peaceful and progressive life is at once dis-
turbed. In the age of Kali, the first attack of the venomous snake is struck
against the God-made varpasrama-dharma, and thus a person properly
qualified as a brahmana is called a Sidra, and a दका by qualification
is passing as a brahmana, all on a false birthright claim. To become a
brahmana by a birthright claim is not at all bona fide, although it may be
a fulfillment of one of the conditions. But the real qualification of a
brahmana is to control the mind and the senses, and to cultivate tolerance,
simplicity, cleanliness, knowledge, truthfulness, devotion and faith in the
Vedic wisdom. In the present age, consideration of the necessary qualifi-
cation is being neglected, and the false birthright claim is being supported
even by a popular, sophisticated poet and author of Ramacarita-manas.
This is all due to the influence of the age of Kali. Thus mother earth,
represented as a cow, was lamenting the regrettable condition.

TRANSLATION
Laksmiji, the goddess of fortune, whose glance of grace was sought
by demigods like Brahma and others and for whom they surrendered many
a day unto the Personality of Godhead, gave up her own abode in the
forest of lotus flowers and engaged herself in the service of the lotus feet
of the Lord. I was endowed with specific powers to supersede the fortune
of all the three planetary systems by being decorated with the impressions
of the flag, thunderbolt, elephant driving rod and lotus flower, which are
signs of the lotus feet of the Lord. But at the end, when I felt I was so
fortunate, the Lord left me.
PURPORT
The beauty and opulence of the world can be enhanced by the grace of
the Lord and not by any manmade planning. When the Lord Sri Krsna was
present on this earth, the impressions of the special signs of His lotus feet
were stamped on the dust, and as a result of this specific grace, the whole
earth was made as perfect as possible. In other words, the rivers, the seas,
the forests, the hills and the mines, which are the supplying agents for the


--- Page 212 ---
874 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 16
necessities of men and animals, were fully discharging their respective
duties. Therefore the riches of the world surpassed all the riches of all
other planets in the three planetary systems of the universe. One should,
therefore, ask that the grace of the Lord always be present on earth so that
we may be favored with His causeless mercy and be happy, having all
necessities of life. One may ask how we can detain the Supreme Lord on
this earth after His mission is fulfilled and He has left this earth for His
own abode. The answer is that there is no need to detain the Lord. The
Lord, being omnipresent, can be present with us if we want Him at all. By
His omnipresence, He can always be with us if we are attached to His
devotional service by hearing, chanting, remembering, etc.

There is nothing in the world with which the Lord is disconnected. The
only thing we must learn is to excavate the source of connection and thus
be linked with Him by offenseless service. We can be connected with Him
by the transcendental sound representation of the Lord. The holy name of
the Lord and the Lord Himself are identical, and one who chants the holy
name of the Lord in an offenseless manner can at once realize that the
Lord is present before him. Even by the vibration of radio sound, we can
partially realize sound relativity, and by resounding the sound of tran-
scendence we can verily feel the presence of the Lord. In this age, when
everything is polluted by the contamination of Kali, it is instructed in the
scriptures and preached by Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu that by chanting
the holy name of the Lord, we can at once be free from contamination and
gradually rise to the status of transcendence and go back to Godhead. The
offenseless chanter of the holy name of the Lord is as auspicious as the
Lord Himself, and the movement of pure devotees of the Lord all over the
world can at once change the troublesome face of the world. Only by the
propagation of the chanting of the holy name of the Lord can we be
immune from all effects of the age of Kali.

TRANSLATION
O personality of religion, I was greatly overburdened by the undue
military phalanx arranged by atheistic kings, and I was relieved by the
grace of the Personality of Godhead. Similarly you were also in a distressed
condition, weakened by your standing strength, and thus He also incar-
nated by His internal energy in the family of the Yadus to relieve you.
PURPORT

The asuras want to enjoy a life of sense gratification, even at the cost of
others’ happiness. In order to fulfill this ambition, the asuras, especially
atheistic kings or state executive heads, try to equip themselves with all
kinds of deadly weapons to bring about a war in a peaceful society. They
have no ambition other than personal aggrandizement, and thus mother
earth feels overburdened by such undue increases of military strength. By
increase of the asuric population, those who follow the principles of re-
ligion become unhappy, especially the devotees or devas.

Only in such a situation the Personality of Godhead incarnates to
vanquish the unwanted asuras and to reestablish the true principles of
religion. This was the mission of Lord Sri Krsna, and He fulfilled it.

TRANSLATION
Who can, therefore, tolerate the pangs of separation from that
Supreme Personality of Godhead? He could conquer the gravity and
passionate wrath of His sweethearts like Satyabhama and others by His
sweet smile of love, pleasing glance and hearty appeals. When He traversed
my [earth’s] surface, I would be immersed in the dust of His lotus feet
and thus would be sumptuously covered with grass which appeared like
hairs standing on me out of pleasure.
PURPORT
There were chances of separation between the Lord and His thousands
of queens because of the Lord’s being absent from home, but as far as His
connection with earth was concerned, the Lord would traverse the earth
with His lotus feet, and therefore there was no chance of separation. When
the Lord left the surface of the earth to return to His spiritual abode, the
earth’s feelings of separation were therefore more acute.

Sarasvati River, which flowed towards the East.

Sata Gosvami said: After reaching that place, Maharaja Pariksit ob-
served that a lower caste इताः, dressed like a king, was beating a cow and
a bull with a club, as if they had no owner.
PURPORT
The principal sign of the age of Kali is that lower caste $iidras, i.e. men
without brahminical culture and spiritual initiation, will be dressed like
administrators or kings, and the principal business of such non-ksatriya
rulers will be to kill the innocent animals, especially the cows and the bulls

who shall be unprotected by their masters, the bona fide vaisyas, or the
mercantile community. In the Bhagavad-gita (Bg. 18.44), it is said that the
vaiSyas are meant to deal in agriculture, cow protection and trade. In the
age of Kali, the degraded vaisyas, or the mercantile men, are engaged in
supplying cows to slaughterhouses. The ksatriyas are meant to protect the
citizens of the state, whereas the vaiSyas are meant to protect the cows
and bulls and utilize them to produce grains and milk. The cow is meant
to deliver milk, and the bull is meant to produce grains. But in the age of
Kali, the siidra class of men are in the posts of administrators, and the
cows and bulls, or the mothers and the fathers, unprotected by the vaisyas,
are subjected to the slaughterhouses organized by the Sidra administrators.

TRANSLATION
The bull was as white as a white lotus flower. He was terrified of the
83013 who was beating him, and he was so afraid that he was standing on
one leg, trembling and urinating.
PURPORT
The next symptom of the age of Kali is that principles of religion,
which are all spotlessly white, like the white lotus flower, will be attacked
by the uncultured $807৫ population of the age. They may be descendants
of brahmana or ksatriya forefathers, but in the age of Kali, for want of
sufficient education and culture of Vedic wisdom, such sidra-like popula-

tion will defy the principles of religion, and persons who are religiously
endowed will be terrified by such men. They will declare themselves as
adhering to no religious principles, and many ‘isms’ and cults will spring up
in Kali-yuga only to kill the spotless bull of religion. The state will be
declared to be secular, or without any particular principle of religion, and
as a result there will be total indifference to the principles of religion. The
citizens will be free to act as they like, without respect for sadhu, sastra
and guru. The bull standing on one leg indicates that the principles of
religion are gradually diminishing. Even the fragmental existence of reli-
gious- principles will be embarrased by so many obstacles as if in the
trembling condition of falling down at any time.

any calf; asru-vadanam—with tears in her eyes; ksamam—very weak;

TRANSLATION
Although the cow is beneficial because one can draw religious prin-
ciples from her, she was now rendered poor and calfless. Her legs were
being beaten by a Sidra. There were tears in her eyes, and she was
distressed and weak. She was hankering after some grass in the field.
PURPORT

The next symptom of the age of Kali is the distressed condition of the
cow. Milking the cow means drawing the principles of religion in a liquid
form. The great rsis and munis would live only on milk. Srila Sukadeva


--- Page 219 ---
882 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 17
Gosvam1 would go to a householder while he was milking a cow, and he
would simply take a little quantity of it for subsistence. Even fifty years
ago, no one would deprive a sadhu of a quart or two of milk, and every
householder would give milk like water. For a sanatanist (the follower of
Vedic principles) it is the duty of every householder to have cows and
bulls as household paraphernalia, not only for drinking milk, but also for
deriving religious principles. The sanatanist worships cows on religious
principles and respects brahmanas. The cow’s milk is required for the
sacrificial fire, and by performing sacrifices the householder can be
happy. The cow’s calf is not only beautiful to look at, but also gives
satisfaction to the cow, and so she delivers as much milk as possible. But
in the Kali-yuga, the calves are separated from the cow as early as
possible for purposes which may not be mentioned in these pages of
Srimad-Bhdgavatam. The cow stands with tears in her eyes, and the
Sidra milkman draws milk from the cow artificially, and when there is no
milk the cow is sent to be slaughtered. These greatly sinful acts are
responsible for all the troubles in present society. They do not know
what they are doing in the name of economic development. The influence
of Kali will keep them in the darkness of ignorance, and despite all
endeavors for peace and prosperity, they must try to see the cows and
the bulls happy in all respects. Foolish people do not know how happiness
is earned by making the cows and bulls happy, but it is a fact by the law
of nature. Let us take it from the authority of Srimad-Bhdgavatam and
adopt the principles for the total happiness of humanity.

ing like thunder.
PURPORT
An administrative head or king like Maharaja Pariksit, with full majestic
authority, well equipped with weapons to chastise miscreants, can challenge
the agents of the age of Kali. Then only will it be possible to counteract
the degraded age. And in the absence of such strong executive heads, there
is always disruption of tranquility. The elécted show bottle executive head,
as representative of a degraded public, cannot be equal with a strong king
like Maharaja Pariksit. The dress or style of royal order does not count. It
is one’s actions which are counted.

the principles of the twice-born ksatriyas.


--- Page 221 ---
884 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 17
PURPORT

The brahmanas, ksatriyas and vai$yas are called twice-born because for
these higher classes of men there is one birth by parental conjugation and
there is another birth of cultural rejuvenation by spiritual initiation from
the bona fide acarya or spiritual master. So a ksatriya is also twice-born
like a brahmana, and his duty is to give protection to the helpless. The
ksatriya king is considered to be the representative of God to give
protection to the helpless and chastise the miscreants. Whenever there are
anomalies in thisroutine work by the administrators, there is an incarnation
of the Lord to reestablish the principles of a godly kingdom. In the age of
Kali, the poor helpless animals, especially the cows, which are meant to
receive all sorts of protection from the administrative heads, are killed
without restriction. Thus the administrative heads, under whose nose such
things happen, are so-called representatives of God. Such powerful
administrators are rulers of the poor citizens by dress or office only, but
factually they are worthless, lower class men without the cultural assets
of the twice-born. No one can expect justice or equality of treatment from
once-born (without spiritual culture) lower class men. Therefore in the age
of Kali everyone is unhappy due to the maladministration of the state.
The modern human society is not twice-born by spiritual culture. There-
fore the people’s government, by the people who are not twice-born, must
be a government of Kali in which everyone is unhappy.

You rogue, do you dare beat an innocent cow because Lord Krsna and
Arjuna, the carrier of the Gandiva bow, are out of sight? Since you are
beating the innocent in a secluded place, you are considered a culprit and
therefore deserve to be killed.
PURPORT
In a civilization where God is conspicuously banished and there is no
devotee warrior like Arjuna, the associates of the age of Kali take advantage
of this lawless kingdom and arrange to kill innocent animals like the cow
in secluded slaughterhouses. Such murderers of animals stand to be
condemned to death by the order of a pious king like Maharaja Pariksit.
For a pious king, the culprit who kills an animal in a secluded place is
punishable by the death penalty, exactly like a murderer who kills an
innocent child in a secluded place.

form of a bull?


--- Page 223 ---

PURPORT
At least up to the time of Maharaja Pariksit, no one could imagine the
wretched conditions of the cow and the bull. Maharaja Pariksit was,
therefore, astonished to see such a horrible scene. He inquired, therefore,
whether the bull was not a demigod assuming such a wretched condition
to indicate the future of the cow and the bull.

Now for the first time in a kingdom well protected by the arms of

Up till now no one on earth has ever shed tears because of royal negligence.
PURPORT
The protection of the lives of both the human being and the animals is
the first and foremost duty of a government. A government must not
discriminate in such principles. It is simply horrible for a purehearted
soul to see organized animal killing by the state in this age of Kali.
Maharaja Pariksit was lamenting for the tears in the eyes of the bull, and
he was astonished to see such an unprecedented thing in his good kingdom.
Both men and animals were equally protected as far as life was concerned.
That is the way in God’s kingdom.

the ruler and subduer of all envious men, there is no cause for you to cry.
Everything will be good for you.
PURPORT
Protection of bulls and cows and all other animals can only be possible
when there is a state ruled by an executive head like Maharaja Pariksit.
Maharaja Pariksit addresses the cow as mother for he is a cultured twice-
born ksatriya king. Surabhi is the name of the cows which exist in the
spiritual planets and are especially reared by Lord Sri Krsna Himself. As
men are made after the form and features of the Supreme Lord, so also
the cows are made after the form and features of the surabhi cows in the
spiritual kingdom. In the material world the human society gives all
protection to the human being, but there is no law to protect the descen-
dants of Surabhi who can give all protection to men by supplying the
miracle food milk. But Maharaja Pariksit and the Pandavas were fully
conscious of the importance of the cow and bull, and they were prepared
to punish the cow-killer with all chastisement, including death. There has
sometimes been agitation for the protection of the cow, but for want of
pious executive heads and suitable laws, the cow and the bull are not


--- Page 225 ---
888 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 17
given protection. The human society should recognize the importance of
the cow and the bull and thus give all protection to these important
animals, following in the footsteps of Maharaja Pariksit. By protecting the
cow and brahminical culture, the Lord, who is very kind to the cow and
the brahmanas (go-brahmana-hitaya), will be pleased with us and will

sufferings of those who suffer. Therefore I must kill this most wretched
man because he is violent against other living beings.

PURPORT

When there is some disturbance caused by wild animals in a village or
town, the police or others take action to kill them. Similarly, it is the duty
of the government to kill at once all bad social elements such as thieves,
dacoits, murderers, etc. The same punishment is also due to animal -killers
because the animals of the state are also the [णठ Prajz means one who
has taken birth in the state and includes both men and animals. Any living
being who takes birth in a state has the primary right to live under the
protection of the king. The jungle animals also are subject to the king, and
they have a right to live also. So what to speak of domestic animals like
the cows and bulls.

Any living being, if he terrifies other living beings, is a most wretched
subject, and the king should at once kill such a disturbing element. As the
wild animal is killed when it creates disturbances, similarly any man who
unnecessarily kills or terrifies the jungle animals or other animals must be
punished at once. By the law of the Supreme Lord, all living beings, in
whatsoever shape they may be, are the sons of the Lord, and no one has
any right to kill another animal, unless it is so ordered by the codes of
natural law. The tiger can kill a lower animal for his subsistence, but a man
cannot kill an animal for his subsistence. That is the law of God, who has
created the law that a living being subsists by eating another living being.
Thus the vegetarians are also living by eating other living beings. Therefore,
the law is that one should live only by eating specific living beings, as
ordained by the law of God. The [Sopanisad directs that one should live
by the direction of the Lord and not at one’s sweet will. A man can subsist
on varieties of grains, fruits and milk ordained by God, and there is no
need of animal food, save and except in particular cases.

The illusioned king or the executive head, even though sometimes
advertised as a great philosopher and learned scholar, will allow slaughter-
houses in the state without knowing that torturing poor animals clears the
way to hell for such foolish kings or executive heads. The executive head
always must be alert to the safety of the prajds, both man and animal, and
inquire whether a particular living being is harassed at any place by
another living being. The harassing living being must at once be caught and
put to death, as shown by Maharaja Pariksit.


--- Page 227 ---
890 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 17

The people’s government, or government by the people, should not
allow killing innocent animals by the sweet will of foolish government
men. They must know the codes of God, as mentioned in the revealed
scriptures. Maharaja Pariksit quotes here that in the codes of God the
irresponsible king or state executive jeopardizes his good name, duration
of life, power and strength and ultimately his progressive march towards a
better life or salvation after death. Such foolish men do not even believe
in existence in the next life.

While commenting on this particular verse, we have in our presence the
statement of a great modern politician who has recently died and left his
will, which discloses his poor fund of knowledge of the codes of God
mentioned by Maharaja Pariksit. The politician was so ignorant of the
codes of God that he writes: “I do not believe in any such ceremonies and
to submit to them, even as a matter of form would be hypocrisy and an
attempt to delude ourselves and others . . . I have no religious sentiment in
the matter.”

Contrasting these statements of a great politician in the modern age with
that of Maharaja Pariksit, we find a vast difference. Maharaja Pariksit was
pious according to the scriptural codes, whereas the modern politician
goes by his personal belief and sentiments. Any great man of the material
world is after all a conditioned soul. He is bound up by his hands and feet
by the ropes of material nature, and still the foolish conditioned soul
thinks of himself as free to act by his whimsical sentiments. The conclusion
is that people in the time of Maharaja Pariksit were happy, and the animals
were given proper protection because the executive head was not whimsical
nor ignorant of God’s law. Foolish faithless creatures try to avoid the
existence of the Lord and proclaim themselves secular at the cost of
valuable human life. The human life is especially meant for knowing the
science of God, but foolish creatures, especially in this age of Kali, instead
of knowing God scientifically, make propaganda against religious belief as
well as the existence of God, even though they are always bound by the
laws of God by the symptoms of birth, death, old age and disease.

TRANSLATION
He [Maharaja Pariksit] repeatedly addressed and questioned the bull
thus: O son of Surabhi, who has cut off your three legs? In the state of
the kings who are obedient to the laws of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Krsna, there is no one as unhappy as you.
PURPORT

The kings or the executive heads of all states must know the codes of
Lord Krsna (generally Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam) and must
act accordingly in order to fulfill the mission of human life, which is to
make an end to all miseries of material conditions. One who knows the
codes of Lord Krsna can achieve this end without any difficulty. In the
Bhagavad-gita in a synopsis we can understand the codes of Godhead, and
in the Srimad-Bhagavatam the same codes are explained further.

In a state where the codes of Krsna are followed, no one is unhappy.
Where such codes are not followed, the first sign is that three legs of the
representative of religion are cut off, and thereby all miseries follow.
When Krspa was personally present, the codes of Krsna were being fol-
lowed without question, but in His absence such codes are presented in the
pages of Srimad-Bhagavatam for the guidance of the blind persons who
happen to be at the helm of all affairs.

which blackmail the reputation of the sons of Prtha.
PURPORT

The reputation of the reign of Maharaja Ramacandra and that of the
kings who followed in the footsteps of Maharaja Ramacandra, like the
Pandavas and their descendants, are never to be forgotten because in their
kingdom offenseless and honest living beings were never in trouble. The
bull and the cow are the symbols of the most offenseless living beings
because even the stool and urine of these animals are utilized to benefit
human society. The descendants of the sons of Prtha, like Maharaja
Pariksit and others, were afraid of losing their reputations, but in the
modern days they are not even afraid of killing such offenseless animals.
Herein lies the difference between the reign of those pious kings and the
modern states ruled by irresponsible executive heads without knowledge
in the codes of God.

TRANSLATION
Whoever causes offenseless living beings to suffer must fear me any-
where and everywhere in the world. By curbing dishonest miscreants, one
automatically benefits the offenseless.
PURPORT
Dishonest miscreants flourish because of cowardly and impotent execu-
tive heads of state. But when such executive heads are strong enough to
curb all sorts of dishonest miscreants, in any part of the state, certainly
they cannot flourish. When the miscreants are punished in an exemplary
manner, automatically all good fortune follows. As said before, it is the
prime duty of the king or the executive head to give protection in all
respects to the peaceful offenseless citizens of the state. The devotees of
the Lord are by nature peaceful and offenseless, and therefore it is the
prime duty of the state to arrange to convert everyone to become a devotee
of the Lord, and thus automatically there will be peaceful offenseless
citizens. Then the only duty of the king will be to curb the dishonest
miscreants. That will bring about peace and harmony all over human
society.

894 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 17
PURPORT

The denizens of the heavenly kingdom are called amaras, or deathless,
due to their possessing a long span of life, far greater than that of the
human beings. For a human being, who has only a maximum one hundred
year duration of life, a span of life spreading over millions of years is
certainly considered to be deathless. For example, from the Bhagavad-gita
we learn that on the Brahmaloka planet, the duration of one day is calcu-
lated to be 4,300,000 x 1,000 solar years. Similarly, in other heavenly
planets one day is calculated to be six months of this planet, and they
get a life of ten million of their years. Therefore, in all higher planets,
since the span of life is far greater than that of the human being, the
denizens are called deathless by imagination, although actually no one
within the material universe is deathless.

Maharaja Pariksit challenges even such denizens of heaven if they tor-
ture the offenseless. This means that the state executive head must be as
strong as Maharaja Pariksit so that he may be determined to punish the
strongest offenders. It should be the principle of a state executive head
that the offender of the codes of God is always punished.

Text 17] Punishment and Reward of Kali 895

PURPORT
In the scriptures there is mention of apad-dharma, or occupational duty
at times of extraordinary happenings. It is said sometimes that the great
sage Visvamitra had to live on the flesh of dogs in some extraordinary
dangerous position. In cases of emergency, one may be allowed to live on
the flesh of animals of all description, but that does not mean that there
should be regular slaughterhouses to feed the animal eaters and that this
system should be encouraged by the state. No one should try to live on
flesh in ordinary times simply for the sake of the palate. If anyone does
so, the king or the executive head should punish him for gross enjoyment.
There are regular scriptural injunctions for different persons engaged
in different occupational duties, and one who follows them is called
sva-dharma-stha, or faithful in one’s prescribed duties. In the Bhagavad-
gita also (Bg. 18.48) it is advised that one should not give up his occupa-
tional prescribed d uties, even if they are not always flawless. Such sva-
dharma might be violated in cases of emergency, if one is forced by
circumstances, but they cannot be violated in the ordinary times. The
state executive head is to see that such sva-dharma is not changed by the
follower, whatever it may be, and he should give all protection to the
follower of sva-dharma. The violater is subject to punishment in terms of
the $astra, and it is the duty of the king to see that everyone strictly

follows his occupational duty, as prescribed in the scripture.

TRANSLATION
The personality of religion said: These words just spoken by you befit
a person of the Pandava dynasty. Captivated by the devotional qualities
of the Pandavas, even Lord Krsna, the Personality of Godhead, performed
duties as a messenger.
PURPORT
The assurances and challenges made by Maharaja Pariksit are never
exaggerations of his real power. The Maharaja said that even the denizens
of heaven could not escape his stringent government if they were violators
of religious principles. He was not proud falsely because a devotee of the
Lord is equally or sometimes more powerful than the Lord by His grace,
and any promise made by a devotee, though it may be ordinarily very
difficult to fulfill, is properly executed by the grace of the Lord. The
Pandavas, by their unalloyed devotional service and full surrender unto
the Lord, made it possible for the Lord to become a chariot driver or
sometimes their letter messenger. Such duties executed by the Lord for
His devotee are always very pleasing to the Lord because the Lord wants
to render service to His unalloyed devotee whose life has no other engage-
ment than to serve the Lord with full love and devotion. Maharaja Pariksit,
grandson of Arjuna, the celebrated friendly servitor of the Lord, was a
pure devotee of the Lord like his grandfather, and therefore the Lord was
always with him, even from the time when he was helplessly lying in the
womb of his mother and was attacked by the blazing Brahmastra weapon
of Asvatthama. A devotee is always under the protection of the Lord, and
therefore the assurance of protection by Maharaja Pariksit could never be
without meaning. The personality of religion accepted this fact and thus
thanked the King for his being true to his exalted position.

TRANSLATION
O greatest among human beings, it is very difficult to ascertain the
particular miscreant who has caused our sufferings because we are bewil-
dered by all the different opinions of theoretical philosophers.
PURPORT

There are many theoretical philosophers in the world who put forward
their own theory of cause and effect especially about the cause of suffering
and its effect on different living beings. Generally there are six great
philosophers: Kanada, the author of Vaidesika philosophy; Gautama, the
author of logic; Pataiijali, the author of mystic yoga; Kapila, the author
of Sankhya philosophy; Jaimini, the author of Karma-mimarsa; and
Vyasadeva, the author of Vedanta Darsana.

Although the bull, or the personality of religion, and the cow, the
personality of the earth, knew perfectly well that the personality of Kali
was the direct cause of their sufferings, still, as devotees of the Lord, they
knew well also that without the sanction of the Lord no one could inflict
trouble upon them. According to the Padma Purana, our present trouble
is due to the fructifying of seedling sins, but even those seedling sins also
gradually fade away by execution of pure devotional service. Thus even if
the devotees see the mischiefmongers, they do not accuse them for the
sufferings inflicted. They take it for granted that the mischiefmonger is
made to act by some indirect cause, and therefore they tolerate the
sufferings, thinking them to be God-given in small doses only, otherwise
the sufferings should have been greater.

Maharaja Pariksit wanted to get a statement of accusation against the
direct mischief monger, but they declined to give it on the above-mentioned


--- Page 235 ---
898 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 17
grounds. Speculative philosophers, however, do not recognize the sanction
of the Lord, but they try to find out the cause of sufferings in their own
way, as will be described in the following verses. According to Srila Jiva
Gosvami, such speculators are themselves bewildered, and thus they cannot
know that the ultimate cause of all causes is the Supreme Lord, the
Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION
Some of the philosophers, who deny all sorts of duality, declare that
one’s own self is responsible for his personal happiness and distress. Others
say that superhuman powers are responsible, while yet others say that
activity is responsible, and the gross materialists maintain that nature is
the ultimate cause.
PURPORT
As referred to above, philosophers like Jaimini and his followers estab-
lish that fruitive activity is the root cause of all distress and happiness, and
even if there is a superior authority, some superhuman powerful God or
gods, He or they are also under the influence of fruitive activity because
they rewardresult according to one’s action, and action is not independent
because action is performed by some performer; therefore the performer
himself is the cause of his own happiness or distress. In the Bhagavad-gita


--- Page 236 ---
Text 20] Punishment and Reward of Kali 899
also it is confirmed (Bg. 6.5) that by one’s mind, freed from material
affection, one can deliver himself from the sufferings of material pangs.
So one should not entangle oneself in matter by the mind’s material
affections. Thus one’s own mind is one’s friend or enemy in one’s material
happiness and distress.

Atheistic materialistic Sarikhyaites conclude that material nature is the
cause of all causes. According to them, combinations of material elements
are the causes of material happiness and distress, and disintegration of
matter is the cause of freedom from all material pangs. Gautama and
Kanada find out that the atomic combination is the cause of everything,
and impersonalists like Astavarkra discover that the spiritual effulgence of
Brahman is the cause of all causes. But in the Bhagavad-gita the Lord
Himself declares that He is the source of impersonal Brahman also, and
therefore He, the Personality of Godhead, is the ultimate cause of all
causes. It is also confirmed in the Brahma-sarmhita that Lord Krsna is the
ultimate cause of all causes.

yourself by thinking over all this with your own intelligence.


--- Page 237 ---
900 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 17
PURPORT

The Vaisnavites or the devotees of the Lord do believe, as above ex-
plained, that nothing can take place without the sanction of the Supreme
Lord. He is the supreme director, for He confirms in the Bhagavad-gita
(Bg. 15.15) that He, as all-pervading Paramatma, stays in each and every-
one’s heart and keeps vigilance over all actions and witnesses all activities.
The argument of the atheist that one cannot be punished for one’s mis-
deeds, unless proved before a qualified justice, is refuted herein, for we
accept the perpetual witness and constant companion of the living being.
A living being may forget all that he might have done in his past or present
life, but one must know that in the same tree of the material body, the
individual soul and the Supreme Soul as Paramatma are sitting like two
birds. One of them, the living being, is enjoying the fruits of the tree,
whereas the Supreme Being is there to witness the activities. Therefore the
Paramatma feature or the Supreme Soul is actually the witness of all
activities of the living being, and by His direction only the living being can
remember or forget what he might have done in the past. He is, therefore,
both the all-pervading impersonal Brahman and the localized Paramatma
in everyone’s heart. He is the knower of all past, present and future, and
nothing can be concealed from Him. The devotees know this truth, and
therefore they discharge their duties sincerely, without being overly
anxious for rewards. Besides that, one cannot estimate the Lord’s reactions
either by speculation or by scholarship. Why does He put some into
difficulty and not others? He is the supreme knower of the Vedic know-
ledge, and thus He is the factual Vedantist. At the same time He is the
compiler of the Vedanta. No one is independent of Him, and everyone is
engaged in His service in different ways. In the conditioned state, such
services are rendered by the living being under force by the material nature,
whereas in the liberated state the living being is helped by the spiritual
nature in the voluntary loving service of the Lord. There is no incongruity
or inebriety in His actions. All are on the path of Absolute Truth.
Bhismadeva correctly estimated the inconceivable actions of the Lord.
The conclusion is, therefore, that the sufferings of the representative of
religion and the representative of the earth, as present before Maharaja
Pariksit, are planned in order to prove that Maharaja Pariksit was the ideal
executive head, for he knew well how to give protection to the cows (the
earth) and the brahmanas (religious principles), the two pillars of spiritual
advancement. Everyone is under the full control of the Lord. He is quite
correct in His action when He desires something to be done by someone,
irrespective of the consideration of the particular case. Maharaja Pariksit

philosophy and knowledge, and the King was satisfied, since he could

such things touching philosophical truths. The Emperor, being also on an
equal level of sagacity, replied to the point, without doubts or mistakes.

A devotee’s conclusion is that no one is directly responsible to become
a benefactor or mischiefmonger without the sanction of the Lord; there-
fore he does not consider anyone to be directly responsible for such
action. But in both the cases he takes it for granted that either benefit or
loss is God-sent, and thus it is His grace. In case of benefit, no one will
deny it is God-sent, but in case of loss or reverses it becomes doubtful how
the Lord could be so unkind to His devotee as to put him in great diffi-
culty. Jesus Christ was seemingly put into such great difficulty, being
crucified by the ignorant, but he was never angry at the mischiefmongers.
That is the way of accepting a thing, either favorable or unfavorable. Thus
for a devotee the identifier is equally a sinner, like the mischiefmonger.
By God’s grace, the devotee tolerates all reverses, and Maharaja Pariksit
observed this, and therefore he could understand that the bull was no
other than the personality of religion himself. In other words, a devotee
has no suffering at all because so-called suffering is also God’s grace for a
devotee who sees God in everything. They never placed any complaint
before the King for being tortured by the personality of Kali, although
everyone lodges such complaints before the state authorities. The extra-
ordinary behavior of the bull made the King conclude that the bull was

certainly the personality of religion, otherwise no one could understand
the finer intricacies of the codes of religion.

TRANSLATION
Thus it is concluded that the Lord’s energies are inconceivable. No
one can estimate them by mental speculation or by word jugglery.
PURPORT
A question may be raised as to why a devotee should refrain from
identifying an actor, although he knows definitely that the Lord is the
ultimate doer of everything. Knowing the ultimate doer, one should not
pose himself as ignorant of the actual performer. To answer this doubt,
the reply is that the Lord is also not directly responsible because everything
is done by His deputed mdya-sakti, or material energy. The material
energy is always provoking doubts about the supreme authority of the
Lord. The personality of religion knew perfectly well that nothing can
take place without the sanction of the Supreme Lord, and still he was put
into doubts by the deluding energy, and thus he refrained from men-
tioning the supreme cause. This doubtfulness was due to the contamina-
tion of both Kali and the material energy. The whole atmosphere of the
age of Kali is magnified by the deluding energy, and the proportion of
measurement is inexplicable.

TRANSLATION
In the age of Satya [truthfulness] your four legs were established by
the four principles of austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness. But it
appears that three of your legs are broken due to rampant irreligion in the
form of pride, lust for women, and intoxication.
PURPORT
The deluding energy, or material nature, can act upon the living beings
proportionately in terms of the living beings’ falling prey to the deluding
attraction of maya. Moths are captivated by the glaring brightness of
light, and thus they become a prey to the fire. Similarly, the deluding
energy is always captivating the conditioned souls to become a prey to
the fire of delusion, and the Vedic scriptures warn the conditioned souls
not to become a prey to delusion but to get rid of it. The Vedas warn us
not to go to the darkness of ignorance but to the progressive path of
light. The Lord Himself also warns that the deluding power of material
energy is too powerful to overcome, but one who completely surrenders
unto the Lord can easily do so. But to surrender unto the lotus feet of the
Lord is also not very easy. Such surrender is possible by persons of
austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness. These four principles of
advanced civilization were remarkable features in the age of Satya. In that
age, every human being was practically a qualified brahmana of the


--- Page 242 ---
Text 25] Punishment and Reward of Kali 905
highest order, and in the social orders of life they were all paramaharmsas,
or the topmost in the renounced order. By cultural standing, the human
beings were not at all subjected to the deluding energy. Such strong men
of character were competent enough to get away from the clutches of
maya. But gradually, and as the basic principles of brahminical culture,
namely austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness, became curtailed
by proportionate development of pride, attachment for women and
intoxication, the path of salvation or the path of transcendental bliss
retreated far, far away from the human society. With the progression of
the age of Kali, people are becoming very proud, and attached to women
and intoxication. By the influence of the age of Kali, even a pauper is
proud of his penny, the women are always dressed in an overly attractive
fashion to victimize the minds of men, and the man is addicted to
drinking wine, smoking, drinking tea and chewing tobacco, etc. All these
habits, or so-called advancement of civilization, are the root causes of all
irreligiosities, and therefore it is not possible to check corruption, bribery
and nepotism. Man cannot check all these evils simply by statutory acts
and police vigilance, but he can cure the disease of the mind by the
proper medicine, namely advocating the principles of brahminical culture
or the principles of austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness. Modern
civilization and economic development are creating a new situation of
poverty and scarcity with the result of blackmailing the consumer’s
commodities. If the leaders and the rich men of the society spend fifty
percent of their accumulated wealth mercifully for the misled mass of
people and educate them in God consciousness or in the knowledge of
Bhagavatam, certainly the age of Kali will be defeated in its attempt to
entrap the conditioned souls. We must always remember that false pride,
or too high an estimation of one’s own values of life, undue attachment
to women or association with them, and intoxication will divert the
human civilization from the path of peace, however much the people
clamor for peace in the world. The preaching of the Bhagavatam
principles will automatically render all men practiced to austerity, clean
both inside and outside, merciful to the suffering, and truthful in daily
behavior. That is the way of correcting the flaws of human society which
are very prominently exhibited at the present moment.

somehow or other; yatah—whereby; tam—that; jighrksati—trying to

TRANSLATION

You are now standing on one leg only, which is your truthfulness, and
you are somehow or other hobbling along. But quarrel personified [Kali],

flourishing by deceit, is also trying to destroy that leg.

PURPORT

The principles of religion do not stand on some dogmas or manmade
formulas, but they stand on four primary regulative observances, namely
austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness. The mass of people must be
educated to practice these principles from childhood. Austerity means to
accept voluntarily things which may not be very comfortable for the body
but are conducive for spiritual realization, for example, fasting. Fasting
twice or four times a month is a sort of austerity which may be voluntarily
accepted for spiritual realization only, and not for any other purposes,
political or otherwise. Fastings which are not meant for self-realization
but for some other purposes are condemned in the Bhagavad-gita (Bg. 17.
56). Similarly, cleanliness is necessary both for the mind and the body.
Simply bodily cleanliness may help to some extent, but cleanliness of the
mind is necessary, and it is effected by glorifying the Supreme Lord. No
one can cleanse the accumulated mental dust without glorifying the Su-
preme Lord. A godless civilization cannot cleanse the mind because it has
no idea of God, and for this simple reason people under such a civilization
cannot have good qualifications, however they may be materially equipped.
We have to see things by their resultant action. The resultant action of
human civilization in the age of Kali is dissatisfaction, so everyone is
anxious to get peace of mind. This peace of mind was complete in the Satya
Age because of the existence of the above-mentioned attributes of the
human being. Gradually these attributes have diminished in the Treta-yuga


--- Page 244 ---
Text 27] Punishment and Reward of Kali 907
to three fourths, in the Dviapara to half, and in this age of Kali they are
diminished to one fourth, which is also gradually diminishing on account
of prevailing untruthfulness. By pride, either artificial or real, the resultant
action of austerity is spoiled; by too much affection for female association,
cleanliness is spoiled; by too much addiction to intoxication, mercifulness
is spoiled; and by too much lying propaganda, truthfulness is spoiled. The
revival of Bhagavata-dharma can save the human civilization from falling
a prey to evils of all description.

TRANSLATION
Now she, the chaste one, being unfortunately forsaken, as it were,
by the Personality of Godhead, laments her future with tears in her eyes,
for now she is being ruled and enjoyed by lower class men who pose as
rulers.
PURPORT

The ksatriya, or the man who is qualified to protect the sufferers, is
meant to rule the state. Untrained lower class men, or men without
ambition to protect the sufferers, cannot be placed on the seat of an
administrator. Unfortunately, in the age of Kali the lower class men,
without training, occupy the post of a ruler by strength of popular
votes, and instead of protecting the sufferers, such men create a situation
quite intolerable for everyone. Such rulers illegally gratify themselves at
the cost of all comforts of the citizens, and thus the chaste mother earth
cries to see the pitiable condition of her sons, both men and animals. That
is the future of the world in the age of Kali when irreligiosity prevails
most prominently. And in the absence of a suitable king to curb irreligious
tendencies, educating the people systematically in the teaching of Srimad-
Bhagavatam will clear up the hazy atmosphere of corruption, bribery,
blackmailing, etc.

TRANSLATION
Maharaja Parksit, who could fight one thousand enemies single-
handedly, thus pacified the personality of religion and the earth. Then he
took up his sharp sword to kill the personality of Kali, who is the cause
of all irreligion.
PURPORT
As described above, the personality of Kali is he who deliberately
commits all kinds of sinful acts which are forbidden in the revealed
scriptures. This age of Kali will certainly be full of all activities of Kali,
but this does not mean that the leaders of society, the executive heads,
the learned and intelligent men, or above all the devotees of the Lord
shall sit down tight and become callous to the reactions of the age of
Kali. In the rainy season certainly there will be profuse rainfalls, but that
does not mean that men should not take means to protect themselves
from the rains. It is the duty of the executive heads of state and others
to take all necessary actions against the activities of Kali or the persons
influenced by the age of Kali; and Maharaja Pariksit is the ideal executive
head of the state, for he became at once ready to kill the personality of
Kali with his sharp sword. The administrators should not simply pass
resolutions for anticorruptional steps, but they must be ready with sharp
sword to kill the persons creating corruptions from the angle of vision of
the recognized sastras. The administrators cannot prevent corrupt activities
by allowing wine shops. They must at once close all shops of intoxicating
drugs and wine and force punishment even by death for those who
indulge in the habit of intoxication of all description. That is the way of
stopping the activities of Kali, as exhibited herein by Maharaja Pariksit,
the maha-ratha.

TRANSLATION
When the personality of Kali understood that the King was willing to
kill him, he at once abandoned the dress of a king, and, under pressure of
fear, completely surrendered to him, bowing his head.
PURPORT
The royal dress of the personality of Kali is artificial. The royal dress
is suitable for a king or ksatriya, but when a lower class man artificially
dresses himself as a king, his real identity is disclosed by the challenge of
a bona fide ksatriyalike Maharaja Panksit. A real ksatriya never surrenders.
He accepts the challenge of his rival ksatriya, and he fights either to die
or to win. Surrender is unknown to a real ksatriya. In the age of Kali there
are so many pretenders dressed and posed like administrators or executive
heads, but their real identity is disclosed when they are challenged by a
real ksatriya. Therefore when the artificially dressed personality of Kali
saw that to fight Maharaja Pariksit was beyond his capacity, he bowed
down his head like a subordinate and gave up his royal dress.

TRANSLATION
Maharaja Pariksit, who was qualified to accept surrender and worthy
of being sung in history, did not kill the poor surrendered and fallen Kali,
but smiled compassionately, for he was kind to the poor.
PURPORT
Even an ordinary ksatriya does not kill a surrendered person, and what
to speak of Maharaja Pariksit, who was by nature compassionate and kind
to the poor. He was smiling because the artificially dressed Kali disclosed
his identity as a lower class man, and he was thinking how ironic it was
that no one was saved from his sharp sword when he desired to kill, but the
poor lower class Kali was spared by his timely surrender. Maharaja Pariksit’s
glory and kindness is therefore sung in history. He was a kind and com-
passionate emperor, fully worthy of accepting surrender even from his
enemy. Thus the personality of Kali was saved by the will of Providence.

TRANSLATION
The King thus said: We have inherited the fame of Arjuna; therefore
since you have surrendered yourself with folded hands you need not fear
for your life. But you cannot remain in my kingdom, for you are the friend
of irreligion.
PURPORT
The personality of Kali, who is the friend of all kinds of irreligiosities,
may be excused if he surrenders, but in all circumstances he cannot be
allowed to live as a citizen in any part of a welfare state. The Pandavas
were entrusted representatives of the Personality of Godhead Lord Krsna,
who practically brought into being the Battle of Kuruksetra, but not for
any personal interest. He wanted that an ideal King like Maharaja
Yudhisthira and his descendants like Maharaja Pariksit should rule the
world, and therefore a responsible king like Maharaja Pariksit cannot allow
the friend of irreligiosity to flourish in his kingdom at the cost of the good
fame of the Pandavas. That is the way of wiping out corruption in the state,
and not otherwise. The friends of irreligiosity should be banished from the
state, and that will save the state from corruption.

TRANSLATION
If the personality of Kali or irreligion is allowed to act as a man-god
or an executive head, certainly irreligious principles like greed, falsehood,
robbery, incivility, treachery, misfortune, cheating, quarrel and vanity will
abound.
PURPORT

The principles of religion, namely austerity, cleanliness, mercy and
truthfulness, as we have already discussed, may be followed by the follower
of any faith. There is no need of turning the coat of a Hindu to Mo-
hammedan to Christian or some other faith and thus become a renegade
without following the principles of religion. The Bhagavatam religion urges
following the principles of religion. The principles of religion are not the
dogmas or regulative principles of a certain faith. Such regulative principles
may be different in terms of the time and place concerned. One has to see
whether the aims of religion have been achieved. Sticking to the dogmas
and formulas without attaining the real principles is no good. A secular
state may be impartial to any particular type of faith, but the state cannot
be indifferent to the principles of religion as above mentioned. But in the
age of Kali, the executive heads of state will be indifferent to such religious
principles, and therefore under their patronage the opponents of religious
principles, namely greed, falsehood, cheating, pilfery, etc., will naturally
follow, and so there is no meaning in a propaganda crying to stop cor-
ruption in the state.

TRANSLATION
Therefore, O friend of irreligion, you do not deserve to remain in a
place where experts perform sacrifices according to truth and religious
principles for the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
PURPORT

Yajiiesvara, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the beneficiary
of all kinds of sacrificial ceremonies. Such sacrificial ceremonies are pre-
scribed differently in the scriptures for different ages. In other words,
sacrifice means to accept the supremacy of the Lord and thereby perform
acts by which the Lord may be satisfied in all respects. The atheists do not
believe in the existence of God, and they do not perform any sacrifice for
the satisfaction of the Lord. Any place or country where the supremacy
of the Lord is accepted and thus sacrifice is performed is called brahmavar-
ta. There are different countries in different parts of the world, and each
and every country may have different types of sacrifice to please the
Supreme Lord, but the central point in pleasing Him is ascertained in the
Bhagavatam, and it is truthfulness. The basic principle of religion is truth-
fulness, and the ultimate goal of all religions is to satisfy the Lord. In this
age of Kali, the greatest common formula of sacrifice is the saitkirtana-
yajiia. That is the opinion of the experts who know how to propagate the
process of yajita. Lord Caitanya preached this method of yajiia, and it is
understood from this verse that anywhere and everywhere the sacrificial
method of sarikirtana-yajiia may be performed in order to drive away the

personality of Kali and save the human society from falling prey to the

TRANSLATION
In all sacrificial ceremonies, although sometimes a demigod is wor-
shiped, the Supreme Lord Personality of Godhead is worshiped because
He is the Supersoul of everyone, and exists both inside and outside like the
-air. Thus it is He only who awards all welfare to the worshiper.
PURPORT
It is even sometimes seen that demigods like Indra, Candra, etc., are
worshiped and offered sacrificial awards, yet the rewards of all such sacri-
fices are awarded to the worshiper by the Supreme Lord, and it is the Lord
only who can offer all welfare to the worshiper. The demigods, although
worshiped, cannot do anything without the sanction of the Lord because
the Lord is the Supersoul of everyone, both moving and nonmoving.

Sri Suta Gosvami said: The personality of Kali, thus being ordered by
Maharaja Parksit, began to tremble in fear. Seeing the King before him
like Yamaraja, ready to kill him, Kali spoke to the King as follows.
PURPORT
The King was ready to kill him at once as soon as the personality of
Kali would disobey his order. Otherwise the King had no objection to
allow him to prolong his life. The personality of Kali also, after attempting
to get rid of the punishment in various ways, decided that he must
surrender unto him, and thus he began to tremble in fear of his life. The
King, or the executive head, must be so strong as to stand before the
personality of Kali as the personality of death, Yamaraja. The King’s
order must be obeyed, otherwise the culprit’s life is in risk. That is the way
to rule the personalities of Kali who create disturbance in the normal life
of the state citizens.

PURPORT
The personality of Kali could see that Maharaja Pariksit was the emperor
of all lands all over the world, and thus anywhere he might live he would
have to meet with the same. The personality of Kali was meant for
mischief, and Maharaja Pariksit was meant for subduing all kinds of
mischiefmongers, especially the personality of Kali. It was better, there-
fore, for the personality of Kali to have been killed by the King then and
there instead of being killed elsewhere. He was, after all, a surrendered
soul before the King, and it was for the King to do what was required.

PURPORT
The personality of Kali adressed Maharaja Pariksit as the chief amongst
the protectors of religiosity because the King refrained from killing a
person who surrendered unto him. A surrendered soul should be given all
protection, even though he may be an enemy. That is the principle of
religion. And we can just imagine what sort of protection is given by the
Personality of Godhead to the person who surrenders unto Him, not as an
enemy but as a devoted servitor. The Lord protects the surrendered soul
from all sins and all resultant reactions of sinful acts. (Bg. 18.66)

Text 38] Punishment and Reward of Kali 919
TRANSLATION

Siita Gosvdmi said: Maharaja Panksit, thus being petitioned by the
personality of Kali, gave him permission to reside in places where gambling,
drinking, prostitution and animal slaughter were performed.

PURPORT

The basic principles of irreligiosity, such as pride, prostitution, intoxica-
tion and falsehood, counteract the four principles of religion, namely
austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness. The personality of Kali was
given permission to live in four places particularly mentioned by the King,
namely the place of gambling, the place of prostitution, the place of
drinking and the place of animal slaughter.

Srila Jiva Gosvami directs that drinking against the principles of scrip-
tures, such as the Sautramani-yajiia, etc., association with women outside
marriage, and killing animals against the injunctions of scripture, are
irreligious. In the Vedas two different types of injunctions are there for
the pravrttas, or those who are engaged in material enjoyment, and for the
nivrttas, or those who are liberated from material bondage. The Vedic
injunction for the pravrttas is to gradually regulate their activities towards
the path of liberation. Therefore, for those who are in the lowest stage of
ignorance and indulge in wine, woman and flesh, drinking by performing
Sautramani-yajiia, association of woman by marriage and flesh-eating by
sacrifices are sometimes recommended. But such recommendations in the
Vedic literature are meant for a particular class of men, and not for all.
But because there are injunctions of the Vedas for particular types of
persons, such activities by the pravrttas are not considered adharma. One
man’s food may be poison for others; similarly, what is recommended for
those in the modes of ignorance may be poison for those in the modes of
goodness. Srila Jiva Gosvami Prabhu, therefore, affirms that recommenda-
tions in the scriptures for a certain class of men are never to be considered
adharma, or irreligious. But such activities are factually adharma, and they
are never to be encouraged. The recommendations in the scriptures are not
meant for encouragement of such adharmas, but for regulating the
necessary adharmas gradually toward the path of dharma.

Following in the footsteps of Maharaja Pariksit, it is the duty of all
executive heads of states to see that the principles of religion, namely
austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness, are established in the state,


--- Page 257 ---
920 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 17
and the principles of irreligion, namely pride, illicit female association or
prostitution, intoxication and falsity be checked by all means. And to
make the best use of a bad bargain, the personality of Kali may be trans-
ferred to places of gambling, drinking, prostitution and slaughterhouses,
if there are any places like that. Those who are addicted to these irreligious
habits may be regulated by the injunctions of the scripture. In all circum-
stances they should not be encouraged by any state. In other words, the
state should categorically stop all sorts of gambling, drinking, prostitution
and falsity. The state which wants to eradicate corruption by majority
may introduce the principles of religion in the following manner:

1. Two compulsory fasting days in a month, if not more (austerity).
Even from the economic point of view, such two fasting days in a month
in the state will save tons of food, and the system will also act very favor-
ably on the general health of the citizens.

2. There must be compulsory marriage of young boys and girls attaining
twenty-four years of age and sixteen years of age respectively. There is no
harm in coeducation in the schools and colleges provided the boys and
girls are duly married, and in case there is any intimate connection between
a male and female student, they should be married properly without illicit
relation. The divorce act is encouraging prostitution, and this should be
abolished.

3. The citizens of the state must give in charity up to fifty percent of
their income for the purpose of creating a spiritual atmosphere in the state
or in the human society, both individually and collectively. They should
preach the principles of Bhagavatam by a) karma-yoga or doing everything
for the satisfaction of the Lord, b) regular hearing of the Srimad-
Bhagavatam from authorized persons or realized souls, ९) chanting of the
glories of the Lord congregationally at home or at places of worship,
d) rendering all kinds of service to Bhdgavatas engaged in preaching Srimad-
Bhagavatam, and ০) residing in a place where the atmosphere is saturated
with God consciousness. If the state is regulated by the above process,
naturally there will be God consciousness everywhere.

Gambling of all description, even speculative business enterprises, is
considered to be degrading, and by encouraging gambling in the state,
there is a complete disappearance of truthfulness. Allowing young boys
and girls to remain unmarried more than the above-mentioned ages and
license for animal slaughter houses of all description should be at once
prohibited. The flesh-eaters may be allowed to take flesh as is mentioned
in the scriptures, and not otherwise. Intoxication of all description, even
the smoking of cigarettes, the chewing of tobacco or drinking of tea, must
be prohibited.

TRANSLATION
The personality of Kali asked for something more, and because of his
begging, the King gave him permission to live where there is gold because
wherever there is gold there is also falsity, intoxication, lust, envy and
enmity.
PURPORT
Although Maharaja Pariksit gave Kali permission to live in four places,
it was very difficult for him to find the places because during the reign of
Maharaja Pariksit there were no such places. Therefore Kali asked the King
to give him something practical which could be utilized for his nefarious
purposes. Maharaja Pariksit thus gave him permission to live in a place
where there is gold, because wherever there is gold there are all the above-
mentioned four things, and over and above them there is enmity also.
So the personality of Kali became gold standardized. According to Srimad-
Bhagavatam, gold encourages falsity, intoxication, prostitution, envy and
enmity. Even a gold standard exchange and currency is bad. Gold standard
currency is based on falsehood because currency is not on a par with the
reserved gold. The basic principle is falsity because currency notes are
issued more in value than the actual reserved gold. This artificial inflation
of currency by the authorities encourages prostitution of state economy.
The price of commodities becomes artificially inflated because of bad
money or artificial currency notes. Bad money drives away good money.


--- Page 259 ---
922 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 17
Instead of paper currency, actual gold coins should be used for exchange,
and this will stop prostitution of gold. Gold ornaments for women may be
allowed by control, not by quality, but by quantity. This will discourage
lust, envy and enmity. When there is actual gold currency in the form of
coins, the influence of gold in producing falsity, prostitution, etc., will
automatically cease. There will be no need of an anticorruption ministry
for another term of prostitution and falsity of purpose.

Thus the age of Kali began with gold standardization, and therefore

the world, and the saner section is eager to drive out corruption. The
counteracting process is suggested above, and everyone can take advantage
of this suggestion.

TRANSLATION
Therefore whoever desires progressive well-being, especially kings,
religionists, public leaders, brahmanas and sannyasis, should never come in
contact with the four above-mentioned irreligious principles.
PURPORT

The brihmana is the religious preceptor for all other castes, and the
sannyasis are the spiritual masters for all the castes and orders of
society. So also are the king and the public leaders who are responsible for
the material welfare of all people. The progressive religionists and those
who are responsible human beings or those who do not want to spoil their
valuable human lives should refrain from all the principles of irreligiosity,
especially from illicit connection with women. If a brihmana is not truth-
ful, all his claims as a brahmana at once become null and void. If a sannyasi
is illicitly connected with women, all his claims as a sannyasi at once
become false. Similarly, if the king and the public leader are unnecessarily
proud or habituated to drinking and smoking, certainly they become
disqualified to discharge public welfare activities. Truthfulness is the basic
principle for all religions. The four leaders of the human society,
namely the sannyasi, the brahmana, the king and the public leader, must
be tested crucially by their character and qualification. Before one can be
accepted as a spiritual or material master of society, he must be tested by
the above-mentioned criteria of character. Such public leaders may be
less qualified in academic qualifications, but it is necessary primarily that
they are free from the contamination of the four disqualifications, namely
gambling, drinking, prostitution and animal slaughter.

mahim—the earth; ca—and; samavardhayat— perfectly improved.

TRANSLATION
Thereafter the King reestablished the lost legs of the personality of
religion [the bull], and by encouraging activities he sufficiently improved
the condition of the earth.
PURPORT

By designating particular places for the personality of Kali, Maharaja
Pariksit practically cheated Kali. In the presence of Kali, Dharma (in the
shape of a bull), and the earth (in the shape of a cow), he could actually
estimate the general condition of his kingdom, and therefore he at once
took proper steps to reestablish the legs of the bull, namely austerity,
cleanliness and mercy. And for the general benefit of the people of the
world, he saw that the gold stock might be employed for stabilization.
Gold is certainly a generator of falsity, intoxication, prostitution, enmity
and violence, but under the guidance of a proper king or public leader or a
brahmana or sannyasi, the same gold can be properly utilized to reestab-
lish the lost legs of the bull, the personality of religion.

Maharaja Pariksit, therefore, like his grandfather Arjuna, collected all
illicit gold kept for the propensities of Kali and employed it in the
sankirtana-yajiia, as per instruction of the Srimad-Bhagavatam. As we have
suggested before, one’s accumulated wealth may be divided in three parts
for distribution, namely fifty percent for the service of the Lord, twenty-
five percent for the family members and twenty-five percent for personal


--- Page 262 ---
Texts 43-44] Punishment and Reward of Kali 925
necessities. Spending fifty percent for the service of the Lord or for
propagation of spiritual knowledge in society by way of the saitkirtana-
yajiia is the maximum display of human mercy. People of the world are
generally in darkness regarding spiritual knowledge, especially in regard to
devotional service of the Lord, and therefore to propagate the systematic
transcendental knowledge of devotional service is the greatest mercy that
one can show in this world. When everyone is taught to sacrifice fifty
percent of his accumulated gold for the Lord’s service, certainly austerity,
cleanliness and mercy automatically ensue, and thus the lost three legs of
the personality of religion are automatically established. When there is
sufficient austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness, naturally mother
earth is completely satisfied, and there is very little chance for Kali to
infiltrate the structure of human society.

TRANSLATION
The most fortunate Emperor Maharaja Pariksit, who was entrusted
with the kingdom of Hastinapura by Maharaja Yudhisthira when he desired
to retire to the forest, is now ruling the world with great success due to his
being glorified by the deeds of the kings of the Kuru dynasty.
PURPORT
The prolonged sacrificial ceremonies undertaken by the sages of
Naimisaranya were begun a very little after the demise of Maharaja
Panksit. The sacrifice was to continue for one thousand years, and it is
understood that in the beginning some of the contemporaries of Baladeva,
the elder brother of Lord Krsna, also visited the sacrificial place. According
to some authorities, the present tense is also used to indicate the nearest
margin of time from the past. In that sense, the present tense is applied to
the reign of Maharaja Pariksit here. For a continuous fact, also, present
tense can be used. The principles of Maharaja Pariksit can be still continued,
and human society can still be improved if there is determination by the
authorities. We can still purge out from the state all the activities of
immorality introduced by the personality of Kali if we are determined to
take action like Maharaja Pariksit. He alloted some place for Kali, but in
fact Kali could not find such places in the world at all because Maharaja
Pariksit was strictly vigilant to see that there were no places for gambling,
drinking, prostitution and animal slaughter. Modern administrators want
to banish corruption from the state, but fools as they are, they do not
know how to do it. They want to issue licenses for gambling houses, wine
and other intoxicating drug houses, brothels and hotel prostitution and
cinema houses, and falsity in every dealing, even in their own, and they
want at the same time to drive out corruption from the state. They want
the kingdom of God without God consciousness. How can it be possible to
adjust two contradictory matters? If we want to drive out corruption from
the state, we must first of all organize society to accept the principles of
religion, namely austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness, and to
make the condition favorable we must close all places of gambling,
drinking, prostitution and falsity. These are some of the practical lessons
from the pages of Srimad-Bhagavatam.

TRANSLATION
Maharaja Pariksit, the son of Abhimanyu, is so experienced that by
dint of his expert administration and patronage, it has been possible for
you to perform a sacrifice such as this.
PURPORT
The brahmanas and the sannydsis are expert in spiritual advancement of
society, whereas the ksatriyas or the administrators are expert in the
material peace and prosperity of human society. Both of them are the
pillars of all happiness, and therefore they are meant for full cooperation
for common welfare. Maharaja Pariksit was experienced enough to drive
away Kali from his field of activities and thereby make the state receptive
to spiritual enlightenment. If the common people are not receptive, it is
very difficult to impress upon them the necessity of spiritual enlighten-
ment. Austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness, the basic principles of
religion, prepare the ground for the reception of advancement of spiritual
knowledge, and Maharaja Pariksit made this favorable condition possible.
Thus the rsis of Naimisaranya were able to perform the sacrifices for a
thousand years. In other words, without state support, no doctrines of
philosophy or religious principles can progressively advance. There should
be complete cooperation between the brahmanas and the ksatriyas for this
common good. Even up to Maharaja Asoka, the same spirit was prevailing.
Lord Buddha was sufficiently supported by King Asoka, and thus his
particular cult of knowledge was spread all over the world.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the First Canto, Seventeenth
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “Punishment and Reward of
Kali.”

The sages of Naimisaranya became struck with wonder after hearing
about the wonderful administration of Maharaja Pariksit, especially with
reference to his punishing the personality of Kali and making him com-
pletely unable to do any harm within the kingdom. Sita Gosvami was

TRANSLATION
Furthermore, Maharaja Parksit was always consciously surrendered to
the Personality of Godhead, and therefore he was neither afraid nor over-
whelmed by fear due to a snake-bird which was to bite him because of the
fury of a brahmana boy.
PURPORT
A self-surrendered devotee of the Lord is called Narayana-parayana. Such
a person is never afraid of any place or person, not even of death. For him
nothing is as important as the Supreme Lord, and thus he gives equal
importance both to heaven and hell. He knows well that both heaven and
hell are creations of the Lord, and similarly life and death are different
conditions of existence created by the Lord. But in all conditions and in
all circumstances, remembrance of Narayana is essential. The Narayana-
parayana practices this constantly. Maharaja Pariksit was such a pure devo-
tee. He was wrongfully cursed by an inexperienced son of a brahmana who
was under the influence of Kali, and Maharaja Pariksit took this to be sent
by Narayana. He knew that Narayana (Lord Krsna) saved him when he was


--- Page 267 ---
Text 3] Maharaja Pariksit Cursed by a Brahmana Boy 931
burnt in the womb of his mother, and if he were to be killed by a snake
bite, it would also take place by the will of the Lord. The devotee never
goes against the will of the Lord; therefore anything sent by God is a
blessing for the devotee. Therefore Maharaja Pariksit was neither afraid of
nor bewildered by such things. That is the sign of a pure devotee of the
Lord.

TRANSLATION
Furthermore, after leaving all his associates, the King surrendered
himself as a disciple to the son of Vyasa [Sukadeva Gosvami], and thus he
was able to understand the actual position of the Personality of Godhead.
PURPORT
The word gjita is significant here. The Personality of Godhead Sri
Krsna is known as Ajita, or unconquerable, and He is so in every respect.
No one can know His actual position. He is unconquerable by knowledge
also. We have heard about His dhama, or place, eternal Goloka Vrndavana,
but there are many scholars who interpret this abode in different ways.
But by the grace of a spiritual master like Sukadeva Gosvami, unto whom
the King gave himself up as a most humble disciple, one is able to under-
stand the actual position of the Lord, His eternal abode, and His transcen-
dental paraphernalia in that dhama or abode. Knowing the transcendental


--- Page 268 ---
932 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 18
position of the Lord and the transcendental method by which one can
approach that transcendental dhama, the King was confident about his
ultimate destination, and by knowing this he could leave aside everything
material, even his own body, without any difficulty of attachment. In the
Bhagavad-gita, it is stated, param drstva nivartate, or one can give up all
connection of the material attachment when one is able to see the param,
or the superior quality of things. We understand the superior quality of
energy of the Lord and the material quality of material energy from the
Bhagavad-gita and by the grace of a bona fide spiritual master like Sukadeva
Gosvami. It is quite possible to know everything of the superior energy
of the Lord by which the Lord manifests His eternal name, quality,
pastimes, paraphernalia and variegatedness. Unless one thoroughly under-
stands this superior or eternal energy of the Lord, it is not possible to
leave the material energy, however one may theoretically speculate on the
true nature of the Absolute Truth. By the grace of Lord Krsna, Maharaja
Pariksit was able to receive the mercy of a personality like Sukadeva
Gosvami, and thus he was able to know the actual position of the uncon-
querable Lord. It is very difficult to find the Lord from the Vedic litera-
tures, but it is very easy to know Him by the mercy of a liberated devotee
like Sukadeva Gosvami.

PURPORT
The highest perfection of life is attained by remembering the transcen-
dental nature of the Lord at the last moment of one’s life. This perfection
of life is made possible by one who has learned the actual transcendental
nature of the Lord from the Vedic hymns sung by a liberated soul like
Sukadeva Gosvami or someone in that line of disciplic succession. There is
no gain in hearing the Vedic hymns from some mental speculator. When
the same is heard from an actual self-realized soul and is properly under-
stood by service and submission, everything becomes transparently clear.
Thus a submissive disciple is able to live transcendentally and continue to
the end of life. By scientific adaptation, one is able to remember the Lord
even at the end of life when the power of remembrance is slackened due
to derangement of bodily membranes. For a common man, it is very diffi-
cult to remember things as they are at the time of death, but by the grace
of the Lord and His bona fide devotees, the spiritual masters, one can get
this opportunity without difficulty. And it was done in the case of
Maharaja Pariksit.

PURPORT

As we have already explained, the personality of Kali had entered the
jurisdiction of this earth long ago, and he was looking for an opportunity
to spread his influence all over the world. But he could not do so satisfac-
torily due to the presence of Maharaja Pariksit. That is the way of good
government. The disturbing elements like the personality of Kali will
always try to extend their nefarious activities, but it is the duty of the able
state to check them by all means. Although Maharaja Pariksit alloted places
for the personality of Kali, at the same time he gave no chance to the
citizens to be swayed by the personality of Kali.

TRANSLATION
The very day and moment the Personality of Godhead Lord Sri Krsna
left this earth, the personality of Kali, who promotes all kinds of irreligious
activities, came into this world.
PURPORT

The Personality of Godhead and His holy name, qualities, etc., are all
identical. The personality of Kali was not able to enter the jurisdiction of
the earth due to the presence of the Personality of Godhead. And simi-
larly, if there is an arrangement for the constant chanting of the holy


--- Page 271 ---
Text 7] Maharaja Pariksit Cursed by a Brahmana Boy 935
names, qualities, etc., of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there is no
chance at all for the personality of Kali to enter. That is the technique of
driving away the personality of Kali from the world. In modernized human
society there are great advancements of material science, and they have
invented the radio to distribute sound in the air. So instead of vibrating
some nuisance sound for sense enjoyment, if the state arranges to distribute
transcendental sound by resounding the holy name, fame and activities
of the Lord, as they are authorized in the Bhagavad-gita or Srimad-
Bhagavatam, then a favorable condition will be created, and the principles
of religion in the world will be reestablished, and thus the executive
heads, who are so anxious to drive away corruption from the world, will
be successful. Nothing is bad if properly used for the service of the Lord.

TRANSLATION
Maharija Pariksit was a realist, like the bees who only accept the
essence [of a flower]. He knew perfectly well that in this age of Kali,
auspicious things produce good effects immediately, whereas inauspicious
acts must be actually performed [to render effects]. So he was never
envious of the personality of Kali.
PURPORT
The age of Kali is called the fallen age. In this fallen age, because of the
living beings’ being in an awkward position, the Supreme Lord has given
some special facilities to them. So by the will of the Lord, a living being


--- Page 272 ---
936 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 18
does not become a victim of a sinful act until the act is actually performed.
In other ages, simply by thinking of performing a sinful act, one used to
become a victim of the act. On the contrary, a living being, in this age, is
awarded with the results of pious acts simply by thinking of them.
Maharaja Parikgit, being the most learned and experienced king by the
grace of the Lord, was not unnecessarily envious of the personality of
Kali because he did not intend to give him any chance to perform any
sinful act. He protected his subjects from falling prey to the sinful acts of
the age of Kali, and at the same time he gave full facility to the age of
Kali by alloting him some particular places. At the end of the Srimad-
Bhagavatam it is said that even though all nefarious activities of the
personality of Kali are present, there is a great advantage in the age
of Kali. One can attain salvation simply by chanting the holy name of the
Lord. Thus Maharaja Pariksit made an organized effort to propagate
chanting of the Lord’s holy name, and thus he saved the citizens from the
clutches of Kali. It is for this advantage only that great sages sometimes
wish all good for the age of Kali. In the Vedas also it is said that by dis-
course on Lord Krsna’s activities, one can get rid of all the disadvantages of
the age of Kali. In the beginning of the Srimad-Bhagavatam it is also said
that by the recitation of Srimad-Bhagavatam, the Supreme Lord becomes at
once arrested within one’s heart. These are some of the great advantages of
the age of Kali, and Maharaja Pariksit took all the advantages and did not
think any ill of the age of the Kali, true to his Vaignavite cult.

TRANSLATION
Maharaja Pariksit considered that less intelligent men might find the
personality of Kali to be very powerful, but that those who are self-
controlled would have nothing to fear. The King was powerful like a tiger
and took care for the foolish, careless persons.
PURPORT
Those who are not devotees of the Lord are careless and unintelligent.
Unless one is thoroughly intelligent, one cannot be a devotee of the Lord.
Those who are not devotees of the Lord fall prey to the actions of Kali. It
will not be possible to bring about a saner condition in society unless we
are prepared to accept the modes of action adopted by Maharaja Panksit,
i.e., propagation of devotional service of the Lord to the common man.

activities of the Lord are performed in relation with the devotees of the


--- Page 274 ---
938 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 18
Lord. Therefore, the history of the devotees is not different from the
history of Lord Krsna’s activities. A devotee of the Lord regards both the
activities of the Lord and those of His pure devotees on an equal level, for
they are all transcendental.

Those who are desirous of achieving complete perfection in life must

fully.
PURPORT

The systematic hearing of the transcendental activities, qualities and
names of Lord Sri Krsna pushes one toward eternal life. Systematic hearing
means to know Him gradually in truth and fact, and this knowing Him in
truth and fact means to attain eternal life, as it is stated in the Bhagavad-
git. Such transcendental glorified activities of Lord Sri Krsna are the
prescribed remedy for counteracting the process of birth, death, old age
and disease, which are considered to be material awards for the condi-
tioned living being. The culmination of such a perfectional stage of life is
the goal of human life and the attainment of transcendental bliss.

The good sages said: O grave Sita Gosvami! May you live many years
and have eternal fame, for you are speaking very nicely about the activities

mortal beings like us.
PURPORT
When we hear about the transcendental qualities and activities of the
Personality of Godhead, we may always remember what has been spoken
by the Lord Himself in the Bhagavad-gita (Bg. 4.9). His acts, even when
He acts in human society, are all transcendental, for they are all accen-
tuated by the spiritual energy of the Lord, which is distinguished from His
material energy. As stated in the Bhagavad-gita, such acts are called
divyam. This means that He does not act or take His birth like an ordinary
living being under the custody of material energy. Nor is His body material
nor changeable like that of ordinary living beings. And one who under-
stands this fact, either from the Lord or from authorized sources, is not
reborn after leaving the present material body. Such an enlightened soul is


--- Page 276 ---
940 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 18
admitted into the spiritual realm of the Lord and engages in the transcen-
dental loving service of the Lord. Therefore, the more we hear about the
transcendental activities of the Lord, as they are stated in the. Bhagavad-
gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam, the more we can know about His transcen-
dental nature and thus make definite progress on the path back to
Godhead.

We have just begun performance of this fruitive activity, a sacrificial
fire, without certainty of its result due to the many imperfections in our
action. Our bodies have become black from the smoke, but we are factually
pleased by the nectar of the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead
Govinda, which you are distributing.
PURPORT

The sacrificial fire kindled by the sages of Naimisaranya was certainly
full of smoke and doubts because of so many flaws. The first flaw is that
there is an acute scarcity of expert brahmanas able to carry out such per-
formances successfully in this age of Kali. Any discrepancy in such sacri-
fices spoils the whole show, and the result is uncertain, like agricultural
enterprises. The good result of tilling the paddy field depends on provi-
dential rain, and therefore the result is uncertain. Similarly, performance


--- Page 277 ---
Text 13] Maharaja Paciksit Cursed by a Brahmana Boy 941
of any kind of sacrifice in this age of Kali is also uncertain. Unscrupulous
greedy brahmanas of the age of Kali induce the innocent public to such
uncertain sacrificial shows without disclosing the scriptural injunction that
in the age of Kali there is no fruitful sacrificiai performance but the sacri-
fice of the congregational chanting of the holy name of the Lord. Sita
Gosvami was narrating the transcendental activities of the Lord before
the congregation of sages, and they were factually perceiving the result of
hearing these transcendental activities. One can feel this practically, as one
can feel the result of eating food. Spiritual realization acts in that way.

The sages of Naimisaranya were practically sufferers from the smoke of
a sacrificial fire and were doubtful about the result, but by hearing from a
realized person like Siita Gosvami, they were fully satisfied. In the Brahma-
Vaivarta Purana, Visnu tells Siva that in the age of Kali, men full of anxie-
ties of various kinds can vainly labor in fruitive activity and philosophi-
cal speculations, but when they are engaged in devotional service, the
result is sure and certain, and there is no loss of energy. In other words,
nothing performed for spiritual realization or for material benefit can be
successful without devotional service of the Lord.

tion from matter, and what to speak of worldly benedictions in the form
of material prosperity, which is for those who are meant for death.
PURPORT

When there are some similar points, it is possible to compare one thing
to another. One cannot compare the association of a pure devotee to any-
thing material. Men who are addicted to material happiness aspire to reach
the heavenly planets like the moon, Venus, Indraloka, etc., and those who
are advanced in material philosophical speculations aspire after liberation
from all material bondage. When one becomes frustrated in all kinds of
material advancement, one desires the opposite type of liberation, which
is called apunar-bhava, or no rebirth. But the pure devotees of the Lord do
not aspire after the happiness obtained in the heavenly kingdom, nor do
they aspire after liberation from material bondage. In other words, for the
pure devotees of the Lord, the material pleasures obtainable in the heavenly
planets are like phantasmagoria, and because they are already liberated
from all material conceptions of pleasure and distress, they are factually
liberated even in the material world. This means that the pure devotees of
the Lord are engaged in a transcendental existence, namely, in the loving
service of the Lord, both in the material world and in the spiritual world.
As a government servant is always the same, either in the office or at home
or at any place, so a devotee has nothing to do with anything material, for
he is exclusively engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord. Since
he has nothing to do with anything material, what pleasure can he derive
from material benedictions like kingship or other overlordships, which are
finished quickly with the end of the body? Devotional service is eternal,
and it has no end because it is spiritual. Therefore, since the assets of a
pure devotee are completely different from material assets, there is no
comparison between the two. Siita Gosvami was a pure devotee of the
Lord, and therefore his association with the rsis in the Naimisaranya is
unique. In the material world, association with gross materialists is veritably
condemned. The materialist is called yosit-sangi, or one who is much at-
tached to material entanglement (women and other paraphernalia). Such
attachment is conditioned because it drives away the benedictions of life
and prosperity. And just the opposite is bhagavata-sangi, or one who is
always in the association with the Lord’s name, form, qualities, etc. Such
association is always desirable; it is worshipable, it is praiseworthy, and one
may accept it as the highest goal of life.

TRANSLATION
The Personality of Godhead Lord Krsna [Govinda] is the exclusive
shelter for all great living beings, and His transcendental attributes cannot
even be measured by such masters of mystic powers as Lord Siva and Lord
Brahma. Can anyone who is expert in relishing nectar [rasa] ever be fully
satiated by hearing topics about Him?
PURPORT
Lord Siva and Lord Brahma are two chiefs of the demigods. They
are full of mystic powers. For example, Lord Siva drank an ocean of
poison of which one drop is sufficient to kill an ordinary living being.
Similarly, Brahma could create many powerful demigods, including Lord
Siva. So they are iSvaras, or lords of the universe. But they are not the
supreme powerful. The supreme powerful is Govinda, Lord Krsna. He is
transcendence, and His transcendental attributes cannot be measured even
by such powerful ivaras as Siva and Brahma. Therefore Lord Krsna is the


--- Page 280 ---
944 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 18
exclusive shelter of the greatest of all living beings. Brahma is counted
amongst the living beings, but he is the greatest of all of us. And why is the
greatest of all the living beings so much attached to the transcendental
topics of Lord Krsna? Because He is the reservoir of all enjoyment. Every-
one wants to relish some kind of taste from everything, but one who is
engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord can derive un-
limited pleasure from such engagement. The Lord is unlimited, and His
name, attributes, pastimes, entourage, variegatedness, etc., are unlimited,
and those who relish them can do so unlimitedly and still not feel satiated.
This fact is confirmed in the Padma Purana.

There is no end of such transcendental discourses. In mundane affairs
there is the law of satiation, but in transcendence there is no such satiation.
Sata Gosvami desired to continue the topics of Lord Krsna before the
sages of Naimisdranya, and the sages also expressed their readiness to hear
from him continually. Since the Lord is transcendence and His attributes
are transcendental, such discourses increase the receptive mood of the
purified audience.

fore please describe to us the pastimes of the Lord, which are above all
material conception, for we are anxious to receive such messages.
PURPORT
The speaker on the transcendental activities of the Lord should have
only one object of worship and service, Lord Krsna, the Supreme Person-
ality of Godhead. And the audience for such topics should be anxious to
hear about Him. When such a combination is possible, namely a qualified
speaker and a qualified audience, it is then and there very much congenial
to continue discourses on the transcendence. Professional speakers and a
materially absorbed audience cannot derive real benefit from such dis-
courses. Professional speakers make a show of Bhagavata-saptaha for the
sake of family maintenance, and the materially disposed audience hears
such discourses of Bhagavata-saptaha for some material benefit, namely
religiosity, wealth, gratification of the senses, or liberation. Such Bhagava-
tam discourses are not purified from the contamination of the material
qualities. But the discourses between the saints of Naimisaranya and Sri
Siita Gosvami are on the transcendental level. There is no motive for
material gain. In such discourses, unlimited transcendental pleasure is
relished both by the audience and the speaker, and therefore they can
continue the topics for many thousands of years. Now Bhagavata-saptahas
are held for seven days only, and after finishing the show, both the
audience and the speaker become engaged in material activities as usual.
They can do so because the speaker is not Bhagavata-pradhana, and the
audience is not susriusatam, as explained above.

TRANSLATION

0 Sata Gosvami, please describe those topics of the Lord by which
Maharaja Pariksit, whose intelligence was fixed on liberation, attained the
lotus feet of the Lord, who is the shelter of Garuda, the king of birds.
Those topics were vibrated by the son of Vyasa [Srila Sukadeva].

PURPORT

There is some controversy amongst the students on the path of liberation.
Such transcendental students are known as impersonalists and devotees of
the Lord. The devotee of the Lord worships the transcendental form of
the Lord, whereas the impersonalist meditates upon the glaring effulgence
or the bodily ray of the Lord, known as the brahmajyoti. Here in this
verse it is said that Maharaja Pariksit attained the lotus feet of the Lord by
instructions in knowledge delivered by the son of Vyasadeva, Srila Suka-
deva Gosvami. Sukadeva Gosvami was also an impersonalist in the begin-
ning, as he has admitted himself in the Bhagavatam (2.1.9), but later on
he was attracted by the transcendental pastimes of the Lord and thus
became a devotee. Such devotees with perfect knowledge are called maha-
bhagavata, or first-class devotees. There are three classes of devotees,
namely the prakrta, madhyam, and maha-bhagavata. The prakrta or third-
class devotees are temple worshipers without specific knowledge of the
Lord and the Lord’s devotees. The madhyam, or the second-class devotee,
knows well the Lord, the Lord’s devotee, the neophytes, and the nondevo-
tees also. But the maha-bhagavata, or the first-class devotee, sees every-
thing in relation with the Lord and the Lord present in everyone's
relation. The maha-bhagavata, therefore, does not make any distinction,
particularly between a devotee and nondevotee. Maharaja Pariksit was such
a maha-bhagavata devotee because he was initiated by a maha-bhagavata
devotee, Sukadeva Gosvami. He was equally kind, even to the personality
of Kali, and what to speak of others.

So there are many instances in the transcendental histories of the world
of an impersonalist who has later become a devotee. But a devotee has
never become an impersonalist. This very fact proves that on the transcen-
dental steps, the step occupied by a devotee is higher than the step


--- Page 283 ---
Text 17] Maharaja Pariksit Cursed by a Brahmana Boy 947
occupied by an impersonalist. It is also stated in the Bhagavad-gita
(Bg. 12.5) that persons stuck on the impersonal step undergo more
sufferings than achievement of reality. Therefore knowledge imparted by
Sukadeva Gosvami unto Maharaja Pariksit helped him attain the service of
the Lord. And to attain to this stage of perfection is called apavarga, or
the perfect stage of liberation. Simple knowledge of liberation is material
knowledge. Actual freedom from material bondage is called liberation, but
to attain the transcendental service of the Lord is called the perfect stage
of liberation. Such a stage is attained by knowledge and renunciation, as
we have already explained (Bhag. 1.2.12), and perfect knowledge, as
delivered by Srila Sukadeva Gosvami, results in the attainment of tran-
scendental service of the Lord.

TRANSLATION
Thus please narrate to us the narrations of the Unlimited, for they are
purifying and supreme. They were spoken to Maharaja Pariksit, and they
are very dear to the pure devotees, being full of bhakti-yoga.
PURPORT
What was spoken to Maharaja Pariksit and what is very dear to the pure
devotees is Srimad-Bhagavatam. Srimad-Bhagavatam is mainly full of the
narrations of the activities of the Supreme Unlimited, and therefore it is

the science of bhakti-yoga, or devotional service of the Lord. Thus it is
para, or supreme, because although it is enriched with all knowledge and
religion, it is specifically enriched with the devotional service of the Lord.

Sri Sita Gosvami said: 0 God, although we are born in a mixed caste,
we are still promoted in birthright simply by serving and following the
great who are advanced in knowledge. Even by conversing with such great
souls, one can without delay clean up all disqualifications resulting from
lower births.
PURPORT
Sata Gosvami did not take his birth in a brahmana family. He was born
in a family of mixed caste, or an uncultured low family. But because of
higher association, like Sri Sukadeva Gosvami and the great rsis of Naimi-
saranya, certainly the disqualification of inferior birth was washed off.


--- Page 285 ---
Text 18] Maharaja Panksit Cursed by a Brahmana Boy 949
Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu followed this principle in pursuance of the
Vedic usages, and by His transcendental association He elevated many low-
born, or those disqualified by birth or action, to the status of devotional
service and established them in the position of acaryas, or authorities. He
clearly stated that any man, whatever he may be, whether a brahmana or
sudra by birth, or a householder or mendicant in the order of society, if
he is conversant with the science of Krsna, he can be accepted as an
acarya or guru, a spiritual master.

Siita Gosvami learned the science of Krsna from great rsis and authori-
ties like Sukadeva, Vyasadeva, etc., and he was so qualified that even the
sages of Naimisaranya eagerly wanted to hear from him the science of
Krsna in the form of Srimad-Bhagavatam. So he had the double association:
of great souls by hearing and preaching. Transcendental science or the
science of Krsna has to be learned from the authorities, and when one
preaches the science, he becomes still more qualified. So Siita Gosvami had
both the advantages, and thus undoubtedly he was completely freed from
all disqualifications of low birth and mental agonies. This verse definitely
proves that neither Srila Sukadeva Gosvami refused to teach Sita Gosvami
about the transcendental science, nor the sages of the Naimisaranya refused
to hear lessons from him because of his inferior birth. This means that
thousands of years ago there was no bar in learning or preaching the
transcendental science because of inferior birth. The rigidity of the so-
called caste system in Hindu society became prominent within only one
hundred years or so when the number of dvija-bandhus, or disqualified men
in the families of higher castes, increased. Lord Sri Caitanya revived the
original Vedic system, and He elevated Thakur Haridasa to the position of
namacarya, or the authority in the preaching of the glories of the holy
name of the Lord, although His Holiness Srila Haridasa Thakur was
pleased to appear in a family of Mohammedans.

Such is the power of pure devotees of the Lord. The Ganges water is
accepted as pure, and one can become purified after taking a bath in the
waters of the Ganges. But as far as the great devotees of the Lord are
concerned, they can purify a degraded soul even by being seen by the low-
born, and what to speak of association. Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu
wanted to purify the whole atmosphere of the polluted world by sending
qualified preachers all over the world, and it remains with the Indians to
take up this task scientifically and thus to do the best kind of humani-
tarian work. The mental diseases of the present generation are more acute
than bodily diseases; it is quite fit and proper to take up the preaching of
Srimad-Bhagavatam all over the world without delay. Mahattamanam

Abhidhana also means dictionary of great devotees, or a book full of the
words of great devotees. Such a dictionary of the words of great devotees
and that of the Lord are in the Vedas and allied literatures, specifically the
Srimad-Bhagavatam.

TRANSLATION
And what to speak of those who are under the direction of the great
devotees, chanting the holy name of the Unlimited who has unlimited
potency? The Personality of Godhead, unlimited in potency and transcen-
dental by attributes, is called the ananta [Unlimited].
PURPORT
The dvija-bandhu, or the less intelligent uncultured men born of higher
castes, put forward many arguments against the lower caste men becoming
brahmanas in this life. They argue that birth in the family ০0188 0705 or less
than siidras is made possible by one’s previous sinful acts, and therefore
one has to complete the terms of disadvantages due to lower birth. And to
answer these false logicians, Srimad-Bhigavatam asserts that one who


--- Page 287 ---
Text 20] Maharaja Pariksit Cursed by a Brahmana Boy 951
chants the holy name of the Lord under the direction of a pure devotee
can at once get free from the disadvantages due to lower caste birth. A
pure devotee of the Lord does not commit any offense while chanting the
holy name of the Lord. There are ten different offenses in the chanting of
the holy name of the Lord. To chant the holy name under the direction of
a pure devotee is offenseless chanting. Offenseless chanting of the holy
name of the Lord is transcendental, and, therefore, such chanting can at
once purify one from the effects of all kinds of previous sins. This offense-
less chanting indicates that one has fully understood the transcendental
nature of the holy name and has thus surrendered unto the Lord. Transcen-
dentally the holy name of the Lord and the Lord Himself are identical,
being absolute. The holy name of the Lord is as powerful as the Lord. The
Lord is the all-powerful Personality of Godhead, and He has innumerable
names, which are all nondifferent from Him and are equally powerful also.
In thelast word of the Bhagavad-gita the Lord asserts that one who surren-
ders fully unto Him is protected from all sins by the grace of the Lord.
Since His name and He Himself are identical, the holy name of the Lord
can protect the devotee from all effects of sins. The chanting of the holy
name of the Lord can undoubtedly deliver one from the disadvantages of
a lower caste birth. The Lord's unlimited power is extended on and on by
the unlimited expansion of the devotees and incarnations, and thus every
devotee of the Lord and incarnations also can be equally surcharged with
the potency of the Lord. Since the devotee is surcharged with the potency
of the Lord, even fractionally, the disqualification due to lower birth can-
not stand in the way.

TRANSLATION
It is now ascertained that He [the Personality of Godhead] is unlimited
.and there is none equal to Him. Consequently no one can speak of Him
adequately. Great demigods cannot obtain the favor of the goddess of for-
tune even by prayers, but this very goddess renders service unto the Lord,
although He is unwilling to have such service.
PURPORT
The Personality of Godhead, or the Paramesvara Param Brahma, accord-
ing to the sriitis, has nothing to do. He has no equal. Nor does anyone excel
Him. He has unlimited potencies, and His every action is carried out sys-
tematically in His natural and perfect ways. Thus the Supreme Personality
of Godhead is full in Himself, and He has nothing to accept from anyone
else, including the great demigods like Brahma. Others ask for the favor of
the goddess of fortune, and despite such prayers she declines to award such
favors. But still she renders service unto the Supreme Personality of God-
head, although He has nothing to accept from her. The Personality of
Godhead in His Maha-Visnu feature begets Brahma, the first created person
in the material world, from His naval lotus stem and not in the womb of
the goddess of fortune who is eternally engaged in His service. These are
some of the instances of His complete independence and perfection. That
He has nothing to do does not mean that He is impersonal. He is transcen-
dentally so full of inconceivable potencies that simply by His willing,
everything is done without physical or personal endeavor. He is called,
therefore, yogesvara, or the Lord of all mystic powers.

TRANSLATION
Who can be worthy of the name of the Supreme Lord but the Person-
ality of Godhead Sri Krsna? Brahmaji collected the water emanating from
the nails of His feet in order to award it to Lord Siva as a worshipful wel-
come. This very water [the Ganges] is purifying the whole universe,
including Lord Siva.
PURPORT
The conception of many gods in the Vedic literatures by the ignorant
is completely wrong. The Lord is one without a second, but He expands
Himself in many ways, and this is confirmed in the Vedas. Such expan-
sions of the Lord are limitless, but some of them are the living entities. The
living entities are not as powerful as the Lord’s plenary expansions, and
therefore there are two different types of expansions. Lord Brahma is
generally one of the living entities, and Lord Siva is the via medium between
the Lord and the living entities. In other words, even demigods like Lord
Brahma and Lord Siva, who are the chief amongst all demigods, are never
equal to or greater than Lord Visnu the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
The goddess of fortune, Laksmi and all-powerful demigods like Brahma
and Siva are engaged in the worship of Visnu or Lord Krsna; therefore who
can be more powerful than Mukunda (Lord Krsna) to be factually called
the Supreme Personality of Godhead? The goddess of fortune, Laksmiji,
Lord Brahma and Lord Siva are not independently powerful, but they are
powerful as expansions of the Supreme Lord, and all of them are engaged
in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, and so also are the living
entities. There are four sects of worshipful devotees of the Lord, and the


--- Page 290 ---
954 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 18
chief amongst them are the Brahma-sampradaya, Rudra-sampradaya and
Srisampradaya, descending directly from Lord Brahma, Lord Siva and the
goddess of fortune, Laksmi, respectively. Besides the above-mentioned
three sampradayas, there is the Kumarasampradaya, descending from
Sanatkumara. All of the four original sampradayas are still scrupulously
engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord up to date, and they all
declare that Lord Krsna Mukunda is the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
and no other personality is equal to Him or greater than Him.

Self-controlled persons who are attached to the Supreme Lord Sri
Krsna can all of a sudden give up the world of material attachment, includ-
ing the gross body and subtle mind, and go away to attain the highest per-
fection of the renounced order of life, by which nonviolence and renun-
ciation are consequential.
PURPORT
Only the self-controlled can gradually be attached to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Self-controlled means not indulging in sense enjoy-
ment more than is necessary. And those who are not self-controlled are


--- Page 291 ---
Text 23] Maharaja Pariksit Cursed by a Brahmana Boy 955
given over to sense enjoyment. Dry philosophical speculation is a subtle
sense enjoyment of the mind. Sense enjoyment leads one to the path of
darkness. Those who are self-controlled can make progress on the path of
liberation from the conditional life of material existence. The Vedas,
therefore, enjoin that one should not go on the path of darkness but should
make a progressive march towards the path of light or liberation. Self-
control is actually achieved not by artificially stopping the senses from
material enjoyment, but by becoming factually attached to the Supreme
Lord by engaging one’s unalloyed senses in the transcendental service of
the Lord. The senses cannot be forcibly curbed, but they can be given
proper engagement. Purified senses are, therefore, always engaged in the
transcendental service of the Lord. This perfectional stage of sense engage-
ment is called bhakti-yoga. So those who are attached to the means of
bhakti-yoga are factually self-controlled and can all of a sudden give up
theirhomely or bodily attachment for the service of the Lord. This is called
the paramaharmsa stage. Harsas, or swans, accept only milk out of a mix-
ture of milk and water. Similarly, those who accept the service of the Lord
instead of maya’s service are called the paramaharmsas. They are naturally
qualified with all the good attributes, such as pridelessness, freedom from
vanity, nonviolence, tolerance, simplicity, respectability, worship, devotion
and sincerity. All these godly qualities exist in the devotee of the Lord
spontaneously. Such paramaharmsas, who are completely given up to the
service of the Lord, are very rare. They are very rare even amongst the
liberated souls. Real nonviolence means not to be envious. In this world
everyone is envious of his fellow being. But a perfect paramaharisa, being
completely given up to the service of the Lord, is perfectly nonenvious. He
loves every living being in relation with the Supreme Lord. Real renuncia-
tion means to have perfect dependence on God. Every living being is
dependent on someone else because he is so made. Actually everyone is
dependent on the mercy of the Supreme Lord, but when one forgets his
relation with the Lord, he becomes dependent on the conditions of
material nature and thus becomes completely dependent on the mercy of
the Lord. Real independence means to have complete faith in the mercy
of the Lord without being dependent on the conditions of matter. This
paramaharisa stage is the highest perfectional stage in bhakti-yoga, the
process of devotional service to the Supreme Lord.

TRANSLATION
O rsis, who are as powerfully pure as the sun, I shall try to describe to
you the transcendental pastimes of Visnu as far as my knowledge is
concerned. As the birds fly in the sky as far as their capacity allows, so do
the learned devotees describe the Lord as far as their realization allows.
PURPORT
The Supreme Absolute Truth is unlimited. No living being can know
about the unlimited by his limited capacity. The Lord is impersonal,
personal and localized. By His impersonal feature He is all-pervading
Brahman, by His localized feature He is present in everyone’s heart as the
Supreme Soul, and by His ultimate personal feature He is the object of
transcendental loving service by His fortunate associates the pure devotees.
The pastimes of the Lord in different features can only be estimated partly
by the great learned devotees. So Srila Siita Gosvami has rightly taken this
position in describing the pastimes of the Lord as far as he has realized.
Factually only the Lord Himself can describe Himself, and His learned
devotee also can describe Him as far as the Lord gives him the power
of description.

Once upon a time Maharaja Pariksit, while engaged in hunting in the
forest with bow and arrows, became extremely fatigued, hungry and
thirsty while following the stags. While searching for a reservoir of water,
he entered the hermitage of the wellknown Samika Rsi and saw the sage
sitting silently with closed eyes.
PURPORT
The Supreme Lord is so kind to His pure devotees that in proper time
He calls such devotees up to Him and thus creates a circumstance auspicious
for the devotee. Maharaja Pariksit was a pure devotee of the Lord, and
there was no reason for him to become extremely fatigued, hungry and
thirsty because a devotee of the Lord never becomes perturbed by such
bodily demands. But by the desire of the Lord, even such a devotee can
become apparently fatigued and thirsty just to create a situation favorable
for his renunciation of worldly activities. One has to give up all attachment
for worldly relations before one is able to go back to Godhead, and thus


--- Page 294 ---
958 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 18
when a devotee is too much absorbed in worldly affairs, the Lord creates a
situation to cause indifference. The Supreme Lord never forgets His pure
devotee, even though he may be engaged in so-called worldly affairs.
Sometimes He creates an awkward situation, and the devotee becomes
obliged to renounce all worldly affairs. The devotee can understand by the
signal of the Lord, but others take it to be unfavorable and frustrating.
Maharaja Pariksit was to become the medium for the revelation of Srimad-
Bhagavatam by Lord Sri Krsna, as his grandfather Arjuna was the medium
for the Bhagavad-gita. Had Arjuna not been taken up with an illusion of
family affection by the will of the Lord, the Bhagavad-gita would not have
been spoken by the Lord Himself for the good of all concerned. Similarly,
had Maharaja Pariksit not been fatigued, hungry and thirsty at this time,
Srimad-Bhagavatam would not have been spoken by Srila Sukadeva
Gosvami, the prime authority of Srimad-Bhagavatam. So this is a prelude
to the circumstances under which Srimad-Bhagavatam was spoken for the
benefit of all concerned. The prelude, therefore, begins with the words
“Once upon a time.”

Text 27] Maharaja Pariksit Cursed by a Brahmana Boy 959
PURPORT

It appears that the Muni, in whose hermitage the King entered, was in
yogic trance. The transcendental position is attained by three processes,
namely the process of jiiana, or theoretical knowledge of transcendence,
the process of yoga, or factual realization of trance by manipulation of the
physiological and phychological functions of the body, and the most
approved process of bhakti-yoga, or the engagement of senses in the
devotional service of the Lord. In the Bhagavad-gita also we have the
information of the gradual development of perception from matter to a
living entity. Our material mind and body develop from the living entity,
the soul, and being influenced by the three qualities of matter, we forget
our real identity. The jiidna process theoretically speculates about the
reality of the soul. But bhakti-yoga factually engages the spirit soul in
activities. The perception of matter is transcended to still subtler states of
the senses. The senses are transcended to the subtler mind, and then to
breathing activities and gradually to intelligence. Beyond the intelligence,
the living soul is realized by the mechanical activities of the yoga system,
or practice of meditation restraining the senses, regulating the breathing
system and applying intelligence to rise up to the transcendental position.
This trance stops all material activities of the body. The King saw the
Muni in that position. He also saw the Muni as follows.

PURPORT
The King, being thirsty, asked the sage for water. That such a great
devotee and King asked for water from a sage absorbed in trance was
certainly providential. Otherwise there was no chance of such a unique
happening. Maharaja Pariksit was thus placed in an awkward position so
that gradually Srimad-Bhdgavatam could be revealed.

The law of reception in the codes of the Vedic principles states that
even if an enemy is received at home, he must be received with all


--- Page 297 ---
Text 29] Maharaja Pariksit Cursed by a Brahmana Boy 961
respects. He should not be given a chance to understand that he has come
into the house of an enemy. When Lord Krsna, accompanied by Arjuna
and Bhima, approached Jarasandha in Magadha, the respectable enemies
were given a royal reception by King Jarasandha. The guest enemy,
namely Bhima, was to fight with Jarasandha, and yet they were given a
grand reception. At night they used to sit down together as friends and
guests, and in the day they used to fight, risking life and death. That was
the law of reception. The reception law enjoins that a poor man, who has
nothing to offer his guest, should be good enough to offer a straw mat for
sitting, a glass of water for drinking and some sweet words. Therefore, to
receive a guest, either friend or foe, there is no expense. It is only a ques-
tion of good manners.

When Maharaja Pariksit entered the door of Samika Rsi, he did not
expect a royal reception by the Rsi because he knew that saints and rsis
are not materially rich men. But he never expected that a seat of straw, a
glass of water and some sweet words would be denied to him. He was not
an ordinary guest, nor was he an enemy of the Rsi, and therefore the cold
reception by the Rsi astonished the King greatly. As a matter of fact, the
King was right to get angry with the Rsi when he needed a glass of water
very badly. To become angry in such a grave situation was not unnatural
for the King, but because the King himself was not less than a great saint,
his becoming angry and taking action were astonishing. So it must be
accepted that it was so ordained by the supreme will of the Lord. The
King was a great devotee of the Lord, and the saint was also as good as the
King. But by the will of the Lord, the circumstances were so created that
they became ways to the King’s becoming unattached to family connec-
tion and governmental activities and thus becoming a completely surren-
dered soul unto the lotus feet of Lord Krsna. The merciful Lord sometimes
creates such awkward positions for his pure devotees in order to drag them
towards Himself from the mire of material existence. But outwardly the
situations appear to be frustrating to the devotees. The devotees of the
Lord are always under the protection of the Lord, and in any condition,
frustration or success, the Lord is the supreme guide for the devotees. The
pure devotees, therefore, accept all conditions of frustration as blessings
from the Lord.

TRANSLATION
0 brahmanas, the King’s anger and envy, directed toward the brahmana
sage, were unprecedented, being that circumstances had made him hungry
and thirsty.
PURPORT
For a king like Maharaja Pariksit to become angry and envious, espe-
cially at a sage and brahmana, was undoubtedly unprecedented. The King
knew well that brahmanas, sages, children, women and old men are always
beyond the jurisdiction of punishment. Similarly, the king, even though
he commits a great mistake, is never to be considered a wrongdoer. But in
this case, Maharaja Pariksit became angry and envious at the sage due to
his thirst and hunger, by the will of the Lord. The King was right to punish
his subject for coldly receiving him or neglecting him, but because the
culprit was a sage and a brahmana, it was unprecedented. As the Lord is
never envious of anyone, so also the Lord’s devotee is never envious of
anyone. The only justification for Maharaja Pariksit’s behavior is that it
was ordained by the Lord.

TRANSLATION
While leaving, the King, being so insulted, picked up a lifeless snake
with his bow and angrily placed it on the shoulder of the sage. Then he
returned to his palace.
PURPORT

The King thus treated the sage tit for tat, although he was never
accustomed to such silly actions. By the will of the Lord, the King, while
going away, found a dead snake in front of him, and he thought that the
sage, who had coldly received him, thus might be coldly rewarded by being
offered a garland of a dead snake. In the ordinary course of dealing, this
was not very unnatural, but in the case of Maharaja Pariksit’s dealing with
a brahmana sage, this was certainly unprecedented. It so happened by the
will of the Lord.

and eyes closed or whether he had just been feigning trance just to avoid
receiving a lower ksatriya.
PURPORT

The King, being a devotee of the Lord, did not approve of his own
action, and thus he began to wonder whether the sage was really in a
trance or was just pretending in order to avoid receiving the King, who was
ksatriya and therefore lower in rank. Repentance comes in the mind of
a good soul as soon as he commits something wrong. Srila Viévanatha
Cakravartl Thakur, as well as Srila Jiva Gosvami, do not believe that the
King’s action was due to his past misdeeds. The arrangement was so
made by the Lord just to call the King back home, back to Godhead.

According to Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti, the plan was made by
the will of the Lord, and by the will of the Lord the situation of
frustration was created. The plan was that by his so-called misdeed,
the King could be cursed by an inexperienced brahmapa boy infected
by the influence of Kali, and thus the King would leave his hearth
and home for good. His connections with Srila Sukadeva Gosvami would
enable the presentation of the great Srimad-Bhagavatam, which is con-
sidered to be the book incarnation of the Lord. This book incarnation
of the Lord gives much fascinating information of the transcendental
pastimes of the Lord, like His rasa-lila with the spiritual cowherd damsels
of Vrajabhiimi. This specific pastime of the Lord has a special significance
because anyone who properly learns about this particular pastime of the
Lord will certainly be dissuaded from mundane sex desire and be placed
on the path of sublime devotional service to the Lord. The pure devotee’s
mundane frustration is meant to elevate the devotee to a higher transcen-
dental position. By placing Arjuna or the Pandavas in frustration due to
the intrigue of their cousin brothers, the prelude of the Battle of
Kuruksetra was created by the Lord. This was to incarnate the sound
representative of the Lord, Bhagavad-gita. So by placing King Pariksit in
an awkward position, the incarnation of Srimad-Bhagavatam was created
by the will of the Lord. Being distressed by hunger and thirst was only
show, because the King endured much, even in the womb of his mother.
He was never disturbed by the glaring heat of the Brahmastra struck by
Asvatthama. The King’s distressed condition was certainly unprecedented.
The devotees like Maharaja Pariksit are powerful enough to forbear such
distresses, by the will of the Lord, and they are never disturbed. The
situation, in this case, is therefore all planned by the Lord.

The sage had a son who was very powerful, being a brahmana’s son.
While he was playing with inexperienced boys, he heard of his father’s
distress, which was occasioned by the King. Then and there the boy
spoke as follows.
PURPORT
Due to Maharaja Pariksit’s good government, even a boy of tender age,
who was playing with other inexperienced boys, could become as power-
ful as a qualified brahmana. This boy was known as Srrigi, and he achieved
good training in brehmacarya by his father so that he could be as powerful
as a brahmana, even at that age. But because the age of Kali was seeking an
opportunity to spoil the cultural heritage of the four orders of life, the
inexperienced boy gave a chance for the age of Kali to enter into the field
of Vedic culture. Hatred of the lower orders of life began from this
brihmana boy, under the influence of Kali, and thus cultural life began to
dwindle day after day. The first victim of brahminical injustice was Maha-
raja Pariksit, and thus the protection given by the King against the on-
slaught of Kali was slackened.

TRANSLATION
[The brihmana’s son, Srrigi, said:] 0 just look at the sins of the rulers
who, like crows and watchdogs at the door, perpetrate sins against their
masters, contrary to the principles governing servants.
PURPORT
The brahmanas are considered to be the head and brains of the social
body, and the ksatriyas are considered to be the arms of the social body.
The arms are required to protect the body from all harms, but the arms
must act according to the directions of the head and brain. That is a
natural arrangement made by the supreme order, for it is confirmed in the
Bhagavad-gita that four social orders or castes, namely the brahmanas, the
ksatriyas, the vaisyas and the ऽछ काऽ are set up according to quality and
work done by them. Naturally the son of a brahmana has a good chance
to become a brahmana by the direction of his qualified father, as a son of a
medical practitioner has very good chance to become a qualified medical
practitioner. So the caste system is quite scientific. The son must take ad-
vantage of the father’s qualification and thus become a brahmana or
medical practitioner, and not otherwise. Without being qualified, one
cannot become a brihmana or medical practitioner, and that is the verdict
of all scriptures and social orders. Herein Srigi, a qualified son of a great
brahmana, attained the required brahminical power both by birth and
training, but he was lacking in culture because he was an inexperienced
boy. By the influence of Kali, the son of a brahmanpa became puffed
up with brahminical power and thus wrongly compared Maharaja Pariksit
to crows and watchdogs. The King is certainly the watchdog of the state
in the sense that he keeps vigilant eyes over the border of the state for its
protection and defense, but to address him as a watchdog is the sign of a
less cultured boy. Thus the downfall of the brahminical powers began as


--- Page 303 ---
Text 34] Maharaja Pariksit Cursed by a Brahmana Boy 967
they gave importance to birthright without culture. The downfall of the
brahmana caste began in the age of Kali. And since brahmanas are the
heads of the social order, all other orders of society also began to deterio-
rate. This beginning of brahminical deterioration was highly deplored by
the father of Srigi, as we will find.

TRANSLATION
The descendants of the kingly orders are definitely designated as
watchdogs, and they must keep themselves at the door. On what grounds
can dogs enter the house and claim to dine with the master on the
same plate?
PURPORT
The inexperienced brahmana boy certainly knew that the King asked
for water from his father and the father did not respond. He tried to
explain away his father’s inhospitality in an impertinent manner befitting
an uncultured boy. He was not at all sorry for the King’s not being well
received. On the contrary, he justified the wrong act in a way characteristic
of the brahmanas of Kali-yuga. He compared the King to a watchdog, and
so it was wrong for the King to enter the home of a brahmana and ask for
water from the same pot. The dog is certainly reared by its master, but that
does not mean that the dog shall claim to dine and drink from the same
pot. This mentality of false prestige is the cause of the downfall of the


--- Page 304 ---
968 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 18
perfect social order, and we can see that in the beginning it was started by
the inexperienced son of a brahmana. As the dog is never allowed to enter
within the room and hearth, although it is reared by the master, similarly,
according to Srngi, the King had no right to enter the house of Kausika Rsi.
According to the boy’s opinion, the King was on the wrong side and not
his father, and thus he justified his silent father.

After the departure of Lord Sri Krsna the Personality of Godhead

PURPORT
The inexperienced brahmana, puffed up by a little brahma-teja, became
influenced by the spell of Kali-yuga. Maharaja Pariksit gave license to Kali
to live in four places as mentioned herein before, but by his very expert
government the personality of Kali could hardly find the places allotted
him. The personality of Kali-yuga was, therefore, seeking the opportunity
to establish authority, and by the grace of the Lord he found a hole in the
puffed up inexperienced son of a brahmana. The little brahmana wanted
to show his prowess in destruction, and he had the audacity to punish a
great king like Maharaja Parikgsit. He wanted to take the place of Lord

Krsna after His departure. These are the principal signs of upstarts who
want to take the place of Sri Krsna under the influence of the age of Kali.
An upstart with a little power wants to become an incarnation of the Lord.
There are many false incarnations after the departure of Lord Krsna from
the face of the globe, and they are misleading the innocent public by
accepting the spiritual obedience of the general mass of people to maintain
false prestige. In other words, the personality of Kali got the opportunity
to reign through this son of a brahmana, Srrigi.

The circumstances under which Maharaja Pariksit was cursed were
simply childish, as it appears from this verse. Srngi was showing his
impudency amongst his playmates, who were innocent. Any sane man
would have prevented him from doing such great harm to all human
society. By killing a king like Maharaja Pariksit, just to make a show of
acquired brahminical powers, the inexperienced son of a brahmapa com-
mitted a great mistake.

TRANSLATION

The brahmana’s son cursed the King thus: On the seventh day from
today a snake-bird will bite the most wretched one of that dynasty
[Maharaja Pariksit] because of his having broken the laws of etiquette by
insulting my father.

PURPORT

Thus the beginning of the misuse of brahminical power began, and
gradually the brahmanas in the age of Kali became devoid of both
brahminical powers and culture. The brahmana boy considered Maharaja
Pariksit to be kulangara, or the wretched of the dynasty, but factually the
brahmana boy himself was so because from him only the brahmana caste
became powerless, like the snake whose poisoned teeth are broken. The
snake is fearful as long as his poison teeth are there, otherwise he is fearful
only to children. The personality of Kali conquered the brahmana boy
first, and gradually the other castes. Thus the whole scientific system of the
orders of society in this age has assumed the form of a vitiated caste sys-
tem which is now being uprooted by another class of men similarly in-
fluenced by the age of Kali. One should see to the root cause of vitiation
and not try to condemn the system as it is, without knowledge of its
scientific value.

ing the hermitage and seeing his father in that condition, he cried loudly
so that he might be relieved. But it was too late. The father regretted the

Maharaja Pariksit’s act, but the foolish son took it very seriously, and
being influenced by Kali he cursed the King and thus ended a chapter of
happy history.

TRANSLATION
The father heard from his son that the King had been cursed, although
he should never have been condemned for he was the best amongst all
human beings. The rsi did not congratulate his son but, on the contrary,
began to repent, saying: Alas! What a great sinful act was performed by
my son. He has awarded heavy punishment for an insignificant offense.
PURPORT
The king is the best of all human beings. He is the representative of
God, and he is never to be condemned for any of his actions. In other
words, the king can do no wrong. The king may order hanging of a culprit
son of a brahmana, but he does not become sinful for killing a brahmapa.
Even if there is something wrong with the king, he is never to be con-
demned. A medical practitioner may kill a patient by mistaken treatment,
but such a killer is never condemned to death. So what to speak of a good
and pious king like Maharaja Panksit? In the Vedic way of life, the king is
trained to become a rdjargi, or a great saint, although he is ruling as king.
It is the king only by whose good government the citizens can live peace-
fully and without any fear. The rajarsis would manage their kingdom so
nicely and piously that their subjects would respect them as if they were
the Lord. That is the instruction of the Vedas. The king is called narendra,
or the best amongst the human beings. How then could a king like Maha-


--- Page 310 ---
974 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 18
raja Pariksit be condemned by an inexperienced puffed up son of a
brihmana, even though he attained the powers of a qualified brahmana?
The Samik Rsi, since he was an experienced good brihmapa, did not
approve of the actions of his condemned son. He began to lament for all
that his son had done. The king was beyond the jurisdiction of curses as a
general rule, and what to speak of a good king like Maharaja Pariksit. The
offense of the King was most insignificant, and his being condemned to
death was certainly a very great sin for Srigi. Therefore the Rsi Samik
regretted the whole incidence.

TRANSLATION

My dear boy, the Lord, who carries the wheel of a chariot, is represented
by the monarchical regime, and when this regime is abolished the whole
world becomes filled with thieves, who then at once vanquish the
unprotected subjects like scattered lambs.

PURPORT

According to Srimad-Bhdgavatam the monarchical regime represents the
Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead. The king is said to be the
representative of the Absolute Personality of Godhead because he is trained
to acquire the qualities of God to protect the living beings. The Battle of
Kuruksetra was planned by the Lord to establish the real representative of
the Lord, Maharaja Yudhisthira. An ideal king thoroughly trained by
culture and devotional service with the martial spirit makes a perfect king.
Such a personal monarchy is far better than the so-called democracy of no
training and responsibility. The thieves and rogues of modern democracy
seek election by malrepresentation of votes, and the successful rogues and
thieves devour the mass of population. One trained monarch is far better
than hundreds of useless ministerial rogues, and it is hinted herein that by
abolition of a monarchical regime like that of Maharaja Pariksit, the mass
of people become open to many attacks of the age of Kali. They are never
happy in an overly advertised form of democracy. The result of such a
kingless administration is described in the following verses.

TRANSLATION
Due to the termination of the monarchical regimes and the plundering
of the people’s wealth by rogues and thieves, there will be great social
disruptions. People will be killed and injured, and animals and women will
be stolen. And for all these sins we shall be responsible.
PURPORT
The word nah (we) is very significant in this verse. The sage rightly
takes the responsibility of the brahmanas as a community for killing
monarchical government and thus giving an opportunity to the so-called
democrats, who are generally plunderers of the wealth of the state subjects.
The so-called democrats capture the administrative machine without as-
suming responsibility for the prosperous condition of the citizens. Every-
one captures the post for personal gratification, and thus instead of one
king, a number of irresponsible kings grow up to tax the citizens. It is
foretold herein that in the absence of good monarchical government,
everyone will be the cause of disturbance for others by plundering riches,
animals, women, etc.

TRANSLATION
At that time the people in general will fall systematically from the
path of a progressive civilization in respect to the qualitative engagements
of the castes and the orders of society and the Vedic injunctions. Thus
they will be more attracted to economic development for sense gratifica-
tion, and as a result there will be an unwanted population on the level of
dogs and monkeys.
PURPORT

It is foretold herein that in the absence of a monarchical regime, the
general mass of people will be an unwanted population like dogs and mon-
keys. As the monkeys are too sexually inclined and dogs are shameless in
sexual intercourse, the general mass of population born of illegitimate
connection will systematically go astray from the Vedic way of good
manners and qualitative engagements in the castes and orders of life.

The Vedic way of life is the progressive march of the civilization of the
Aryans. The Aryans are progressive in Vedic civilization. The Vedic civili-


--- Page 314 ---
978 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 18
zation’s destination is to go back to Godhead, back home, where there is
no birth, no death, no old age and no disease. The Vedas direct everyone
not to remain in the darkness of the material world but to go towards
the light of the spiritual kingdom far beyond the material sky. The
qualitative caste system and the orders of life are scientifically planned
by the Lord and His representatives, the great rsis. The perfect way of life
gives all sorts of instruction in the things both material and spiritual. The
Vedic way of life does not allow any man to be like the monkeys and dogs.
A degraded civilization of sense gratification and economic development
is the by-product of a godless or kingless government of the people, by the
people, and for the people. The people should not, therefore, begrudge the
poor administrations they themselves elect.

The Emperor Pariksit is a pious king. He is highly celebrated and is a
first-class devotee of the Personality of Godhead. He is a saint amongst
royalty, and he has performed many horse sacrifices. When such a king is
tired and fatigued, being stricken with hunger and thirst, he does not at all
deserve to be cursed.


--- Page 315 ---
Text 47] Maharaja Pariksit Cursed by a Brahmana Boy 979
PURPORT
After explaining the general codes relating to the royal position and
asserting that the king can do no wrong and therefore is never to be con-
demned, the sage Samik wanted to say something about Emperor Pariksit
specifically. The specific qualification of Maharaja Panksit is summarized
herein. The King, even calculated as a king only, was most celebrated as a
ruler who administered the religious principles of the royal order. In the
525८705 the duties of all castes and orders of society are prescribed. All the
qualities of a ksatriya mentioned in the Bhagavad-gita (18.43) were present
in the person of the Emperor. He was also a great devotee of the Lord and
a self-realized soul. Cursing such a king, when he was tired and fatigued
with hunger and thirst, was not at all proper. The Samik Rsi thus admitted
from all sides that Maharaja Pariksit was cursed most unjustly. Although
all the brahmanas were aloof from the incidence, still for the childish action
of a 01৫1770110৫ boy, the whole world situation was changed. Thus the Rsi
Samik, a brahmana, took responsibility for all deterioration of the good
orders of the world.

TRANSLATION
Then the rsi prayed to the all-pervading Personality of Godhead to
pardon his immature boy who had no intelligence and who committed the


--- Page 316 ---
980 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 18
great sin of cursing a person who was completely free from all sins, who
was subordinate and who deserved to be protected.

PURPORT

Everyone is responsible for his own action, either pious or sinful. The
Rsi Samik could foresee that his son had committed a great sin by cursing
Maharaja Pariksit, who deserved to be protected by the brahmanas, for he
was a pious ruler and completely free from all sins because of his being a
first-class devotee of the Lord. When an offense is done unto the devotee
of the Lord, it is very difficult to overcome the reaction. The brahmanas,
being at the head of the social orders, are meant to give protection to their
subordinates and not to curse them. There are occasions when a brahmana
may furiously curse a subordinate ksatriya or vaisya, etc., but in the case
of Maharaja Pariksit there was no grounds as already explained. The
foolish boy had done it out of sheer vanity in being a brahmana’s son, and
thus he became liable to be punished by the law of God. The Lord never
forgives a person who condemns His pure devotee. Therefore the foolish
Srngi had not only committed a sin by cursing a king, but also the greatest
offense. Therefore the rsi could foresee that only the Supreme Personality
of Godhead could save his boy from his sinful act. He therefore directly
prayed for pardon from the Supreme Lord who alone can undo a thing
which is impossible to change. The appeal was made in the name of a
foolish boy who had developed no intelligence at all.

A question may be raised herein that since it was the desire of the Lord
that Pariksit Maharaja was put into that awkward position so that he might
be delivered from material existence, then why was a brahmana’s son made
responsible for this offensive act? The answer is that the offensive act was
performed by a child only so that he could be excused very easily, and thus
the prayer of the father was accepted. But if the question is raised why the
brahmana community as a whole was made responsible for allowing Kali
into the world affairs, the answer is given in the Varaha Purana that the
demons who acted inimically toward the Personality of Godhead but were
not killed by the Lord were allowed to take birth in the families of the
brahmanas to take advantage of the age of Kali. The all-merciful Lord gave
them a chance to have their births in the families of the pious brahmanas
so that they could progress toward salvation. But the demons, instead of
utilizing the good opportunity, misused the brahminical culture due to
being puffed-up by vanity in becoming brahmanas. The typical example is
the son of Samik Rsi, and all the foolish sons of brahmanas are warned


--- Page 317 ---
Text 48] Maharaja Pariksit Cursed by a Brahmana Boy 981
hereby not to become as foolish as Srrigi and be always on guard against
the demoniac qualities which they had in their previous births. The foolish
boy was, of course, excused by the Lord, but others, who may not have a
father like Samik Rsi, will be put into great difficulty if they misuse the
advantages obtained by birth in a brahmana family.

TRANSLATION
The devotees of the Lord are so forbearing that even though they are
defamed, cheated, cursed, disturbed, neglected or even killed, they are
never inclined to avenge themselves.
PURPORT
Rsi Samik also knew that the Lord does not forgive a person who has
committed an offense at the feet of a devotee. The Lord can only give
direction to take shelter of the devotee only. He thought within himself
that if Maharaja Pariksit would counter-curse the boy, he might be saved.
But he knew also that a pure devotee is callous about worldly advantages
or reverses. As such, the devotees are never inclined to counteract personal
defamation, curses, negligences, etc. As far as such things are concerned, in
personal affairs the devotees do not care for them. But in case of their
being performed against the Lord and his devotees, then the devotee takes
very strong action. It was a personal affair, and therefore Samik Rsi knew
that the King would not take counteraction. Thus there was no other
alternative than to place an appeal to the Lord for the immature boy.


--- Page 318 ---
982 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 18
it is not that only the brahmanas are powerful enough to award curses
or blessings upon the subordinates, but the devotee of the Lord, even
though he may not be a brahmana, is more powerful than a brahmana. But
a powerful devotee never misuses the power for personal benefit. Whatever
power the devotee may have is always utilized in service towards the Lord
and His devolees only.

TRANSLATION
The sage thus regretted the sin committed by his own son. He did not
take the insult paid by the King very seriously.
PURPORT
The whole incidence is now cleared up. Maharaja Pariksit’s garlanding
the sage with a dead snake was not at all a very serious offense, but Srrigi’s
cursing the King was a serious offense. The serious offense was committed
by a foolish child only; therefore he deserved to be pardoned by the Su-
preme Lord, although it was not possible to get free from the sinful reac-
tion. Maharaja Pariksit also did not mind the curse offered to him by a
foolish brahmapa. On the contrary, he took full advantage of the awkward
situation, and by the great will of the Lord, Maharaja Parksit achieved the
highest perfection of life through the grace of Srila Sukadeva Gosvami.
Actually it was the desire of the Lord, and Maharaja Pariksit, Rsi Samik
and his son Sragi were all instrumental in fulfilling the desire of the
Lord. So none of them were put into difficulty because everything was
done in relation with the Supreme Person.

TRANSLATION
Generally the transcendentalists, even though engaged by others in the
dualities of the material world, are not distressed. Nor do they take plea-
sure [in worldly things], for they are transcendentally engaged.
PURPORT
The transcendentalists are the empiric philosophers, mystics and the
devotees of the Lord. Empiric philosophers aim at the perfection of merg-
ing into the being of the Absolute, the mystics aim at perceiving the all-
pervading Supersoul, and the devotees of the Lord are engaged in the tran-
scendental loving service of the Personality of Godhead. Since Brahman,
Paramatma, or Bhagavan are different phases of the same Transcendence,
all these transcendentalists are beyond the three modes of material nature.
Material distresses and happinesses are products of the three modes, and
therefore the causes of such material distress and happiness have nothing
to do with the transcendentalists. The King was a devotee, and the rsi was
a mystic. Therefore both of them were unattached to the accidental in-
cidence created by the supreme will. The playful child was an instrument
in fulfilling the Lord’s will.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports of the First Canto, Eighteenth
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “Maharaja Pariksit Cursed by
a Brahmana Boy.”

good man like the King, and such repentance delivers a devotee from all
kinds of sins accidentally committed. The devotees are naturally faultless.
Accidental sins committed by a devotee are sincerely regretted, and by the
grace of the Lord all sins unwillingly committed by a devotee are burnt in
the fire of repentance.

now, for in this way I may be freed of the sinful action and not commit
such an offense again.
PURPORT
The Supreme Lord enjoins that brahmanas and cows must be given all
protection. The Lord is Himself very much inclined to do good to
brahmanas and cows (go-bnihmana-hitaya ca). Maharaja Pariksit knew all
this, and thus he concluded that his insulting a powerful brahmana was

Text 3] Appearance of Sukadeva Gosvami 987
certainly to be punished by the laws of the Lord, and he was expecting
something very difficult in the very near future. He therefore desired the
imminent calamity to fall on him and not on his family members. A man’s
personal misconduct affects all family members. Therefore Maharaja
Pariksit desired the calamity to fall on him alone. By suffering personally he
would be restrained from future sins, and at the same time the sin which
he had committed would be counteracted so that his descendants would
not suffer. That is the way a responsible devotee thinks. The family mem-
bers of a devotee also share the effects of a devotee’s service unto the
Lord. Maharaja Prahlada saved his demon father by his personal devotional
service. A devotee son in the family is the greatest boon or blessing of
the Lord.

attitudes.


--- Page 323 ---
988 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 19
PURPORT

Progressive human civilization is based on brahminical culture, God
consciousness and protection of cows. All economic development of the
state by trade, commerce, agriculture and industries must be fully utilized
in relation to the above principles, otherwise all so-called economic
development becomes a source of degradation. Cow protection means
feeding the brahminical culture which leads towards God consciousness,
and thus perfection of human civilization is achieved. The age of Kali
aims at killing the higher principles of life, and although Maharaja Pariksit
strongly resisted the domination of the personality of Kali within the world,
the influence of the age of Kali came at an opportune moment, and even a
strong king like Maharaja Pariksit was induced to disregard the brahminical
culture due to a slight provocation of hunger and thirst. Maharaja Pariksit
lamented the accidental incidence, and he desired that all his kingdom,
strength and accumulation of wealth would be burnt up for not being
engaged in brahminical culture, etc.

Providentially also, where wealth and strength are not engaged in the
advancement of brahminical culture, God consciousness and cow protec-
tion, the state and home are surely doomed. If we want peace and pros-
perity in the world, we should take lessons from this verse; every state and
every home must endeavor to advance the cause of brahminical culture for
self-purification, God consciousness for self-realization and cow protection
for getting sufficient milk and the best food to continue a perfect civiliza-
tion.

TRANSLATION
While the King was thus repenting, he received news of his imminent
death, which would be due to the bite of a snake-bird, occasioned by the
curse spoken by the sage’s son. The King accepted this as good news, for it
would be the cause of his indifference towards worldly things.
PURPORT
Real happiness is achieved by spiritual existence or by cessation of the
repetition of birth and death. The repetition of birth and death can be
stopped only by going back to Godhead. In the material world, even by
attaining the topmost planet (Brahmaloka), one cannot get rid of the
conditions of repeated birth and death, but we do not accept the path of
attaining perfection. The path of perfection frees one from all material
attachments, and thus one becomes fit to enter into the spiritual kingdom.
Therefore, those who are materially poverty-stricken are better candidates
than those who are materially prosperous. Maharaja Pariksit was a great
devotee of the Lord and a bona fide candidate for entering into the
kingdom of God, but even though he was so, his material assets as the
Emperor of the world were setbacks to perfect attainment of his rightful
status as one of the associates of the Lord in the spiritual sky. As a devotee
of the Lord, he could understand that the cursing of the brahmana boy,
although unwise, was a blessing upon him, being the cause of detachment
from worldly affairs, both political and social. Samika Muni also, after
regretting the incidence, conveyed the news to the King as a matter of
duty so that the King would be able to prepare himself to go back to
Godhead. Samika Muni sent news to the King that foolish Srigi, his son,
although a powerful brahmana boy, unfortunately had misused his spiritu-
al power by cursing the King unwarrantedly. The incidence of the King’s
garlanding the muni was not sufficient cause for being cursed to death,
but since there was no way to retract the curse, the King was informed to
prepare for death within a week. Both Samika Muni and the King were
self-realized souls. Samika Muni was a mystic, and Maharaja Pariksit was a
devotee. Therefore there was no difference between them in self-
realization. Neither of them was afraid of meeting death. Maharaja


--- Page 325 ---
990 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 19
Pariksit could have gone to the muni to beg his pardon, but the news of
imminent death was conveyed to the King with so much regret by the
muni that the King did not want to shame the muni further by his presence
there. He decided to prepare himself for his imminent death and find out
the way to go back to Godhead.

The life of a human being is a chance to prepare himself to go back to
Godhead, or to get rid of the material existence, the repetition of birth
and death. Thus in the system of varpdsrama-dharma every man and woman
is trained up for this purpose. In other words, the system of varnasrama-
dharma is known also as sandtana-dharma, or eternal occupation. The
system of varnasrama-dharma prepares a man for going back to Godhead,
and thus a householder is ordered to go to the forest as vanaprastha to
acquire complete knowledge and then to take sannydsa prior to his
inevitable death. Pariksit Maharaja was fortunate to get a seven-day notice
to meet his inevitable death. But for the common man there is no definite
notice, although death is inevitable for all. Foolish men forget this sure
fact of death and neglect the duty of preparing themselves for going back
to Godhead. They spoil their lives in animal propensities to eat, drink, be
merry and enjoy. Such an irresponsible life is adopted by the people in the
age of Kali because of a sinful desire to condemn brahminical culture, God
consciousness and cow protection, for which the state is responsible. The
state must employ revenue to advance these three items and thus educate
the populace to prepare for death. The state which does so is the real wel-
fare state. The state of India should better follow the examples of Maharaja
Pariksit, the ideal executive head, than to imitate other materialistic states
which have no idea of the kingdom of Godhead, the ultimate goal of human
life. Deterioration of the ideals of Indian civilization has brought about the
deterioration of civic life, not only in India but also abroad.

For a devotee like Maharaja Pariksit, none of the material planets, even
the topmost Brahmaloka, is as desirable as Goloka Vrndavana, the abode
of Lord इन Krsna, the primeval Lord and Original Personality of Godhead.
This earth is one of the innumerable material planets within the universe,
and there are innumerable universes also within the compass of the mahat-
tattva. The devotees are told by the Lord and His representatives, the
spiritual masters or dcaryas, that not one of the planets within all the
innumerable universes is suitable for the residential purposes of a devotee.
The devotee always desires to go back home, back to Godhead, just to
become one of the associates of the Lord in the capacity of servitor,
friend, parent or conjugal lover of the Lord, either in one of the innumer-
able Vaikuntha planets or in the Goloka Vrndavana, the planet of Lord Sri
Krsna. All these planets are eternally situated in the spiritual sky, the
Paravyoma, which is on the other side of the Causal Ocean within the
mahat-tattva. Maharaja Pariksit was already aware of all this information
due to his accumulated piety and birth in a high family of devotees, the
Vaisnavas, and thus he was not at all interested in the material planets.
Modern scientists are very eager to reach the moon by material arrange-
ments, but they cannot conceive of the highest planet of this universe.
But a devotee like Maharaja Pariksit does not care a fig for the moon or,
for that matter, any of the material planets. So when he was assured of his
death on a fixed date, he became more determined in the transcendental
loving service of the Lord Krsna by complete fasting on the bank of

the transcendental River Yamuna which flows down by the capital of
Hastinapura (in the Delhi state). Both the Ganges and the Yamuna are
amartya (transcendental) rivers, and Yamuna is still more sanctified for
the following reasons.

TRANSLATION
The river [Ganges, by which the King sat to fast] carries the most
auspicious water, which is mixed with the dust of the lotus feet of the
Lord and tulasi leaves. Therefore that water sanctifies the three worlds
inside and outside and even sanctifies Lord Siva and other demigods. Con-
sequently everyone who is destined to die must take shelter of this river.
PURPORT
Maharaja Pariksit, just after receiving the news of his death within seven
days, at once retired from family life and shifted himself to the sacred
bank of the Yamuna River. Generally it is said that the King took shelter
on the bank of the Ganges, but according to Srila Jiva Gosvami, the King
took shelter on the bank of the Yamuna. Srila Jiva Gosvami’s statement


--- Page 328 ---
Text 7] Appearance of Sukadeva Gosvami 993
appears to be more accurate because of the geographical situation.
Maharaja Pariksit resided in his capital Hastinapura, situated near present
Delhi, and the River Yamuna flows down past the city. Naturally the King
would take shelter of the River Yamuna because she was flowing past his
palace door. And as far as sanctity is concerned, the River Yamuna is more
directly connected with Lord Krsna than the Ganges. The Lord sanctified
the River Yamuna from the beginning of His transcendental pastimes in
the world. While His father Vasudeva was crossing the Yamuna with the
baby Lord Krsna for a safe place at Gokula on the other bank of the river
from Mathura, the Lord fell down in the river, and by the dust of His
lotus feet the river at once became sanctified. It is especially mentioned
herein that Maharaja Pariksit took shelter of that particular river which is
beautifully flowing, carrying the dust of the lotus feet of Lord Krsna,
mixed with tulasi leaves. Lord Krsna’s lotus feet are always besmeared with
the tulasi leaves, and thus as soon as His lotus feet are contacted with the
water of the Ganges and the Yamuna, the rivers become at once sanctified.
The Lord, however, contacted the River Yamuna more than the Ganges.
According to the Varaha Purina, as quoted by Srila Jiva Gosvami, there is
no difference between the water of the Ganges and the Yamuna, but when
the water of the Ganges is sanctified one hundred times, it is called the
Yamuna. Similarly, it is said in the scriptures that one thousand names of
Visnu are equal to one name of Rama, and three names of Lord Rama are
equal to one name of Krsna.

TRANSLATION
Thus the King, the worthy descendant of the Pandavas, decided once
and for all and sat on the Ganges’ banks to fast until death and give
himself up to the lotus feet of Lord Krsna, who alone is able to award
liberation. So, freeing himself from all kinds of associations and attach-
ments, he accepted the vows of a sage.
PURPORT
The water of the Ganges sanctifies all the three worlds, including the
gods and the demigods, because it emanates from the lotus feet of the
Personality of Godhead Visnu. Lord Krsna is the fountainhead of the
principle of Visnu-tattva, and therefore shelter of His lotus feet can deliver
one from all sins, including an offense which was committed by the King
unto a brahmana. Maharija Pariksit, therefore, decided to meditate upon
the lotus feet of Lord Sri Krsna, who is Mukunda, or the giver of libera-
tions of all description. The banks of the Ganges or the Yamuna give one
a chance to remember the Lord continuously. Maharaja Pariksit freed
himself from all sorts of material association and meditated upon the
lotus feet of Lord Krsna, and that is the way of liberation. To be free
from all material association means to cease completely from committing
any further sins. To meditate upon the lotus feet of the Lord means to
become free from the effects of all previous sins. The conditions of the
material world are so made that one has to commit sins willingly or
unwillingly, and the best example is Maharaja Pariksit himself, who was a
recognized sinless pious king. But he also became a victim of an offense,
even though he was ever unwilling to commit such a mistake. And he was
cursed also, but because he was a great devotee of the Lord, even such
reverses of life became favorable. The principle is that one should not
willingly commit any sin in his life and should constantly remember the
lotus feet of the Lord without deviation. In such a mood only the Lord
will help the devotee to make regular progress towards the path of libera-
tion and thus attain the lotus feet of the Lord. Even if there are accidental

sins committed by the devotee, the Lord saves the surrendered soul from
all sins, as it is confirmed in all scriptures.

At that time all the great minds and thinkers, accompanied by their
disciples, and sages who could verily sanctify a place of pilgrimage just by
their presence, arrived there on the plea of making a pilgrim’s journey.
PURPORT
When Maharaja Pariksit sat down on the bank of the Ganges, the news
spread in all directions of the universe, and the great-minded sages, who
could follow the importance of the occasion, all arrived there on the plea
of pilgrimage. Actually they came to meet Maharaja Pariksit and not to
take a bath of pilgrimage because all of them were competent enough to


--- Page 331 ---
996 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 19
sanctify the pilgrimages. Common men go to pilgrimage sites to get them-
selves purified of all sins. Thus the place of pilgrimage becomes overbur-
dened with the sins of others. But when such sages visit overburdened
places of pilgrimage, they sanctify the place by their presence. Therefore
the sages who came to meet Maharaja Pariksit were not very much
interested in getting themselves purified like other common men, but on
the plea of taking a bath in that place they came to meet Maharaja Pariksit
because they could foresee that Srimad-Bhagavatam would be spoken by
Sukadeva Gosvami. All of them wanted to take advantage of the great
occasion.

Kavasa, Kumbhayoni, Dvaipayana and the great personality Narada.

PURPORT

Cyavana: A great sage and one of the sons of Bhrgu Muni. He was born
prematurely when his pregnant mother was kidnapped. Cyavana is one of
the six sons of his father.

Bhrgu: When Brahmaji was performing a great sacrifice on behalf of
Varuna, Maharsi Bhrgu was born from the sacrificial fire. He was a great
sage, and his very dear wife was Puloma. He could travel in space like
Durvasa, Narada and others, and he used to visit all planets of the
universe. Before the Battle of Kuruksetra, he tried to stop the battle.
Sometimes he instructed Bharadvaja Muni about astronomical evolution,
and he is the author of the great Bhrgu-sarmbhita, the astrological calcula-
tion. He explained how air, fire, water and earth are generated from ether.
He explained how the air in the stomach works and regulates the intestines.
As a great philosopher, he logically established the eternity of the living
entity (Mahabharata, Santi, Ch. 87). He was also a great anthropologist,
and the theory of evolution was long ago explained by him. He was a
scientific propounder of the four divisions and orders of human society
known as the 0৫7৫4707710 institution. He converted the ksatriya king
Bitahavyak to become a brahmana.

Parasara: He is the grandson of Vasistha Muni and father of Vyasadeva.
He is the son of Maharsi Sakti, and his mother’s name was Adrisyanti. He’
was in the womb of his mother when she was only twelve years old. And
from within the womb of his mother he learned the Vedas. His father was
killed by a demon, Kalmaspada, and to avenge this he wanted to annihilate
the whole world. He was, however, restrained by his grandfather Vasistha.
He then performed a Raksas-killing yajiia, but Maharsi Pulasta restrained
him. He begot Vyasadeva, being attracted by Satyavati, who was to
become the wife of Maharaja Santanu. By the blessings of Parasara,
Satyavati became fragrant for miles. He was present also during the time
of Bhisma’s death. He was spiritual master of Maharaja Janaka and a great
devotee of Lord Siva. He is the author of many Vedic scriptures and
sociological directions.

Gadhi-suta or Visvamitra: A great sage of austerity and mystic power.
He is famous as Gadhi-suta because his father was Gadhi, a powerful
king of the province of Kanyakubja (part of Uttar Pradesh). Although he
was a ksatriya by birth, he became a brahmana in the very same body by


--- Page 333 ---
998 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 19
the power of his spiritual achievements. He picked a quarrel with Vasistha
Muni when he was a ksatriya king and performed a great sacrifice in
cooperation with Mataiiga Muni and thus was able to vanquish the sons of
Vasistha. He became a great yogi, and yet he failed to check his senses and
thus was obliged to become the father of Sakuntala, the beauty queen of
world history. Once, when he was a ksatriya king, he visited the hermitage
of Vasistha Muni, and he was given a royal reception. Visvamitra wanted
from Vasistha a cow named Nandini, and the Muni refused to deliver it.
He stole the cow, and thus there was a quarrel between the sage and the
King. Visvamitra was defeated by the spiritual strength of Vasistha, and
thus the King decided to become a brahmapa. Before becoming a brah-
mana he underwent severe austerity on the bank of the Kaudika. He was
also one who tried to stop the Kuruksetra war.

Angira: He is one of the six mental sons of Brahma and the father of
Brhaspati, the great learned priest of the demigods in the heavenly planets.
He is born of the semen of Brahmaji given to a cinder of fire. Utthato and
Samvarta are his sons. It is said that he is still performing austerity and
chanting the holy name of the Lord at a place known as Alokananda on
the banks of the Ganges.

Utathya: One of the three sons of Maharsi Angira. He was the spiritual
master of Maharaja Mandhata. He married Bhadra, the daughter of Soma
(Moon). Varuna kidnapped his wife Bhadra, and to retaliate the offense of
the god of water, he drank all the water of the world.

Medhatithi: An old sage of yore. An assembly member of the heavenly
King Indradeva. His son was Kanva Muni, who brought up Sakuntala in
the forest. He was promoted to the heavenly planet by strictly following
the principles of retired life (vanaprastha).

Devala: A great authority like Narada Muni and Vyasadeva. His good
name is on the list of authorities mentioned in the Bhagavad-gita when
Arjuna acknowledged Lord Krsna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
He met Maharaja Yudhisthira after the Battle of Kuruksetra, and he is the
elder brother of Dhaumya, the priest of the Pandava family. Like the
ksatriyas, he also allowed his daughter to select her own husband in a
svayarmvara meeting, and at that ceremony all the bachelor sons of the
rsis were invited. According to some, he is not Asita Devala. ,

Gautama: One of the seven great sages of the universe. Saradvan
Gautama is one of his sons. Persons in the Gautama-gotra (dynasty) today
are either his family descendants or in his disciplic succession. The
brahmanas who profess Gautama-gotra are generally family descendants,
and the ksatriyas and vai§yas who profess Gautama-gotra are all in the line


--- Page 334 ---
Text 11] Appearance of Sukadeva Gosvami 999
of his disciplic succession. He is the husband of the famous Ahalya who
turned into stone, and Indradeva the King of the heaven molested her.
Ahalya was delivered by Lord Ramacandra. He is the grandfather of
Krpacarya, one of the heroes of the Battle of Kuruksetra.

Maitreya: A great rsi of yore. He was spiritual master of Vidura and a
great religious authority. He advised Dhrtarastra to keep good relations
with the Pandavas. Duryodhana disagreed and thus was cursed by him. He
met Vyasadeva and had religious discourses with him.

TRANSLATION
There were also many other saintly demigods, kings and special royal
orders called arunadayas [ a special rank of rajarsis] from different dynasties
of sages. When they all assembled together to meet the Emperor [Pariksit],
he received them properly and bowed his head to the ground.
PURPORT

The system of bowing the head to the ground to show respect to
superiors is an excellent etiquette which obliges the honored guest deep
into the heart. Even the first-grade offender is excused simply by this


--- Page 335 ---
1000 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 19
process, and Maharaja Pariksit, although honored by all the rsis and kings,
welcomed all the big men in that humble etiquette in order to be excused
from any offenses. Generally at the last stage of one’s life this humble
method is adopted by every sensible man in order to be excused before
departure. In this way Maharaja Pariksit implored everyone’s good will for
going back home, back to Godhead.

After all the rsis and others had seated themselves comfortably, the
King, humbly standing before them with folded hands, told them of his
decision to fast until death.
PURPORT
Although the King had already decided to fast until death on the bank
of the Ganges, still he humbly expressed his decision to elicit the opinions
of the great authorities present there. Any decision, however important,
should be confirmed by some authority. That makes the matter perfect.
This means that the monarchs who ruled the earth in those days were not
irresponsible dictators. They scrupulously followed the authoritative deci-

sions of the saints and sages in terms of Vedic injunction. Maharaja
Pariksit, as a perfect king, followed the principles by consulting the
authorities, even up to the last days of his life.

TRANSLATION
The fortunate King said: We are the most grateful of all the kings
who are trained to get favors from the great souls. Generally you [sages]
consider royalty as refuse to be rejected and left in a distant place.
PURPORT
According to religious principle, stool, urine, wash water, etc., must be
left out at a long distance. Attached bath rooms, urinals, etc., may be very
convenient amenities of modern civilization, but they are ordered to be
situated at a distance from residential quarters. That very example is cited
herein in relation to the kingly order for those who are progressively
marching back to Godhead. Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu said that
to be in intimate touch with dollars and cents men, or the kingly


--- Page 337 ---
1002 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 19
order, is worse than suicide for one who desires to go back to Godhead. In
other words, the transcendentalists do, not generally associate with men
who are too enamored by the external beauty of Gods creation. By
advanced knowledge in spiritual realization, the transcendentalist knows
that this beautiful material world is nothing but a shadowy reflection of
the reality, the kingdom of God. They are not, therefore, very -much
captivated by royal opulence or anything like that. But in the case of
Maharaja Pariksit, the situation was different. Apparently the King was
condemned to death by an inexperienced brahmana boy, but factually he
was called by the Lord to return to Him. Other transcendentalists, the great
sages and mystics who assembled together because of Maharaja Pariksit’s
fasting unto death, were quite anxious to see him, for he was going back to
Godhead. Maharaja Pariksit also could understand that the great sages: who
assembled there were all kind to his forefathers, the Pandavas, because of
their devotional service of the Lord. He felt, therefore, grateful to the
sages for being present there at the last stage of his life, and he felt that it
was all due to the greatness of his late forefathers or grandfathers. He felt
proud, therefore, that he happened to be the descendant of such great
devotees. Such pride for the devotees of the Lord is certainly not equal to
the puffed up sense of vanity for material prosperity. The first is reality,
whereas the other is false and vain.

TRANSLATION
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, the controller of both the
transcendental and mundane worlds, has graciously overtaken me in the
form of a brahmana’s curse. Due to my being too much attached to family
life, the Lord, in order to save me, has appeared before me in such a way
that out of fear only I will detach myself from the world.
PURPORT
Maharaja Pariksit, although born in a family of great devotees, the
Pandavas, and although securely trained in transcendental attachment for
the association of the Lord, still found the allurement of mundane family
life so strong that he had to be detached by a plan of the Lord. Such
direct action is taken up by the Lord in the case of a special devotee.
Maharaja Pariksit could understand this by the presence of the topmost
transcendentalists in the universe. The Lord resides with His devotees, and
therefore the presence of the great saints indicated the presence of the
Lord. The King therefore welcomed the presence of the great rsis as a
mark of favor of the Supreme Lord.

O brahmanas, just accept me as a completely surrendered soul, and
let mother Ganges, the representative of the Lord, also accept me in that
way, for I have already taken the lotus feet of the Lord into my heart. Let
the snake-bird—or whatever magical thing the brahmana created—bite me
at once. I only desire that you all continue singing the deeds of Lord Visnu.
PURPORT
As soon as one is given up completely unto the lotus feet of the Supreme
Lord, he is not at all afraid of death. The atmosphere created by the
presence of great devotees of the Lord on the bank of the Ganges and
Maharaja Pariksit’s complete acceptance of the Lord’s lotus feet were
sufficient guarantee to the King for going back to Godhead. He thus
became absolutely free from all fear of death.

attachment to the unlimited Lord Krsna, association with His devotees
and friendly relations with all living beings.
PURPORT
That a devotee of the Lord is the only perfect living being is explained
herein by Maharaja Pariksit. A devotee of the Lord is no one’s enemy,
although there may be many enemies of a devotee. A devotee of the Lord
does not like to associate with non-devotees, although he has no enmity
with them. He desires association with the devotees of the Lord. This is
perfectly natural because birds of the same feather mix together. And the
most important function of a devotee is to have complete attachment for
Lord Sri Krsna, the father of all living beings. As a good son of the father
behaves friendly with all his other brothers, so also the devotee of the
Lord, being a good son of the supreme father, Lord Krsna, sees all other
living beings in relation with the supreme father. He tries to bring back the
upstart sons of the father to a saner stage and to get them to accept the
supreme fatherhood of God. Maharaja Parksit was certainly going back to
Godhead, but even if he were not to go back, he prayed for a pattern of
life which is the most perfect way in the material world. A pure devotee
does not desire the company of a personality as great as Brahma, but he
prefers the association of a petty living being, provided he is a devotee of
the Lord.

TRANSLATION
In perfect self-control Maharaja Pariksit sat down on a seat of straw,
with straw-roots facing the east, placed on the southern bank of the
Ganges, and he himself faced the north. Just previously he had given
charge of his kingdom over to his sons.
PURPORT
The River Ganges is celebrated as the wife of the sea. The seat of kusa
straw is considered to be sanctified if the straw is taken out of the earth
complete with root, and if the root is pointed towards the east it is
considered to be auspicious. Facing the north is still more favorable for
attaining spiritual success. Maharaja Pariksit handed over the charge of
administration to his son before leaving home. He was thus fully equipped
for all favorable conditions.

TRANSLATION
Thus the King, Maharaja Pariksit, sat to fast until death. All the demi-
gods of the higher planets praised the King’s actions and in pleasure
continually scattered flowers over the earth and beat celestial drums.
PURPORT
Even up to the time of Maharaja Pariksit there were interplanetary
communications, and the news of Maharaja Pariksit’s fasting unto death to
attain salvation reached the higher planets in the sky where the intelligent
demigods live. The demigods are more luxurious than human beings, but
all of them are obedient to the orders of the Supreme Lord. There is no
one in the heavenly planets who is an atheist nonbeliever. Thus any devotee
of the Lord on the surface of the earth is always praised by them, and in
the case of Mahardja Pariksit they were greatly delighted and thus gave
tokens of honor by scattering flowers over the earth and by beating
celestial drums. A demigod takes pleasure in seeing someone go back to
Godhead. He is always pleased with a devotee of the Lord, so much so
that by his adhidaivic powers he may help the devotees in all respects. And
by their actions, the Lord is pleased with them. There is an invisible chain
of complete cooperation between the Lord, the demigods and the devotee
of the Lord on earth.

TRANSLATION
All the great sages who were assembled there also praised the decision
of Maharaja Pariksit and they expressed their approval by saying, “Very
good.” Naturally the sages are inclined to do good to common men, for
they have all the qualitative powers of the Supreme Lord. Therefore they
were very much pleased to see Maharija Pariksit, a devotee of the Lord,

and they spoke as follows. ^

PURPORT
The natural beauty of a living being is enhanced by rising up to the
platform of devotional service. Maharaja Pariksit was absorbed in attach-
ment for Lord Krsna. Seeing this, the great sages assembled were very
pleased, and they expressed their approval by saying, “Very good.” Such
sages are naturally inclined to do good to the common man, and when
they see a personality like Maharaja Pariksit advance in devotional service,
their pleasure knows no bound, and they offer all blessings in their power.
Devotional service of the Lord is so auspicious that all demigods and sages,
up to the Lord Himself, become pleased with the devotee, and therefore
the devotee finds everything auspicious. All inauspicious matters are
removed from the path of a progressive devotee. Meeting all the great sages
at the time of death was certainly auspicious for Maharaja Parksit, and
thus he was blessed by the so-called curse of a brahmana’s boy.

TRANSLATION
[The sages said:] O chief of all the saintly kings of the Pandu dynasty
who are strictly in the line of Lord Sri Krsna! It is not at all astonishing
that you give up your throne, which is decorated with the helmets of
many kings, to achieve eternal association with the Personality of Godhead.
PURPORT

Foolish politicians who hold political administrative posts think that the
temporary posts they occupy are the highest material gain of life, and
therefore they stick to that post even up to the last moment of life without
knowing that achievement of liberation as one of the associates of the Lord
in His eternal abode is the highest gain of life. The human life is meant for
achieving this end. The Lord has assured us in the Bhagavad-gita many
times that going back to Godhead, His eternal abode, is the highest achieve-
ment. Prahlada Maharaja, while praying to Lord Ngsimhha, said, “O my
Lord, I am very much afraid of the materialistic way of life, and I am not
the least afraid of Your present ghastly ferocious feature as Nrsirnhadeva.
This materialistic way of life is something like a grinding stone, and we are
being crushed by it. We have fallen into this horrible whirlpool of the
tossing waves of life, and thus, my Lord, I pray at Your lotus feet to call
me back to Your eternal abode as one of Your servitors. This is the summit
liberation of this materialistic way of life. I have very bitter experience of
the materialistic way of life. In whichever species of life I have taken birth,
compelled by the force of my own activities, I have very painfully experi-
enced two things, namely separation from my beloved and meeting with


--- Page 345 ---
1010 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 19
what is not wanted. And to counteract them, the remedies which | under-
took were more dangerous than the disease itself. So I drift from one
point to another birth after birth, and I pray to You therefore to give me
a shelter at Your lotus feet.”

The Pandava kings, who are more than many saints of the world, know
the bitter results of the materialistic way of life. They are never captivated
by the glare of the imperial throne they occupy, and they seek always the
opportunity of being called by the Lord to associate with Him eternally.
Maharaja Pariksit was the worthy grandson of Maharaja Yudhisthira.
Maharaja Yudhisthira gave up the imperial throne to his grandson, and
similarly Maharaja Pariksit, the grandson of Maharaja Yudhisthira, gave up
the imperial throne to his son Janamejaya .That is the way of all the kings in
the dynasty because they are all strictly in the line of Lord Krsna. Thus the
devotees of the Lord are never enchanted by the glare of materialistic life,
and they live impartially, unattached to the objects of the false illusory
materialistic way of life.

PURPORT

Beyond the limitation of the material creation, which is compared to
the cloud in the sky, there is the Paravyoma, or the spiritual sky, full of
planets called Vaikunthas. Such Vaikuntha planets are also differently
known as the Purusottamaloka, Acyutaloka, Trivikramaloka, Hrsikesa-
loka, Kesavaloka, Aniruddhaloka, Madhavaloka, Pradyumnaloka,
Sankarsapaloka, Sridharaloka, Vasudevaloka, Ayodhyaloka, Dvaraka-
loka, and many other millions of spiritual lokas wherein the Personality
of Godhead predominates; and all the living entities there are liberated
souls with spiritual bodies as good as that of the Lord. There is no material
contamination; everything there is spiritual, and therefore there is nothing
objectively lamentable. They are full of transcendental bliss, and are
without birth, death, old age and disease. And amongst all the above-
mentioned Vaikunthalokas, there is one supreme loka called Goloka
Vrndavana, which is the abode of the Lord Sri Krsna and His specific
associates. Maharaja Pariksit was destined to achieve this particular loka,
and the great rgis assembled there could foresee this. All of them consulted
amongst themselves about the great departure of the great King, and they
wanted to see him up to the last moment because they would no more be
able to see such a great devotee of the Lord. When a great devotee of the
Lord passes away, there is nothing to be lamented because the devotee is
destined to enter into the kingdom of God. But the sorry plight is that
such great devotees leave our sight, and therefore there is every reason to
be sorry. As the Lord is rarely to be seen by our present eyes, so also are
the great devotees. The great rsis, therefore, correctly decided to remain
on the spot till the last moment.

worlds [Satyaloka]. Consequently you are naturally inclined to do good to
others, and but for this you have no interest, either in this life or the next.
PURPORT

Six kinds of opulences, namely wealth, strength, fame, beauty, know-
ledge and renunciation, are all originally the different attributes pertaining
to the Absolute Personality of Godhead. The living beings, who are part
and parcel entities of the Supreme Being, have all these attributes partially,
up to the full strength of seventy-eight percent. In the material world these
attributes (up to seventy-eight percent of the Lord’s attributes) are covered
by the material energy, as the sun is covered by a cloud. The covered
strength of the sun is very dim, compared to the original glare, and
similarly living beings with such attributes become almost extinct from
their original color. There are three planetary systems, namely the lower
worlds, the intermediate worlds and the upper worlds. The human beings
on earth are situated at the beginning of the intermediate worlds, but
living beings like Brahma and his contemporaries live in the upper worlds,
of which the topmost is Satyaloka. In Satyaloka the inhabitants are fully
cognizant of Vedic wisdom, and thus the mystic cloud of material energy
is cleared, and therefore they are known as the Vedas personified. Such
persons, being fully aware of knowledge both mundane and transcendental,
have no interest in either the mundane or transcendental worlds. They are
practically desireless devotees. In the mundane world they have nothing to
achieve, and in the transcendental world they are full in themselves. Then
why do they come to the mundane world? They descend on different
planets as messiahs by the order of the Lord to deliver the fallen souls. On
the earth they come down and do good to the people of the world in
different circumstances under different climatic influences. They have
nothing to do in this world save and except reclaim the fallen souls rotting
in material existence, deluded by material energy.

TRANSLATION
0 trustworthy brahmanas, I now ask you about my immediate duty.
Please, after proper deliberation, tell me of the unalloyed duty of everyone
in all circumstances, and specifically of those who are just about to die.
PURPORT
In this verse the King has placed two questions before the learned
sages. The first question is what is the duty of everyone in all circum-
stances, and the second question is what is the specific duty of one who is
to die very shortly. Out of the two, the question relating to the dying man
is most important because everyone is a dying man, either very shortly or
after one hundred years. The duration of life is immaterial, but the duty
of a dying man is very important. Maharaja Pariksit placed these two
questions before Sukadeva Gosvami also on his arrival, and practically the
whole of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, beginning from the Second Canto up to
the last Twelfth Canto, deals with these two questions. The conclusion
arrived at thereof is that devotional service of the Lord Sri Krsna, as it is
confirmed by the Lord Himself in the last phases of the Bhagavad-gita, is
the last word in relation to everyone’s permanent duty in life. Maharaja
Pariksit was already aware of this fact, but he wanted the great sages
assembled there to unanimously give their verdict on his conviction so
that he might be able to go on with his confirmed duty ‘without contro-
versy. He has especially mentioned the word suddha, or perfectly correct.
For transcendental realization or self-realization, many processes are rec-
ommended by various classes of philosophers. Some of them are first-class
methods, and some of them are second- or third-class methods. The first-


--- Page 350 ---

class method demands that one give up all other methods and surrender
unto the lotus feet of the Lord and thus be saved from all sins and their
reactions.

At that moment there appeared the powerful son of Vyasadeva who
traveled over the earth disinterested and satisfied with himself. He did not
manifest any symptoms of belonging to any social order or status of life.
He was surrounded with women and children, and he dressed as if others
had neglected him.
PURPORT
The word Bhagavan is sometimes used in relation with some of the great
devotees of the Lord, like Sukadeva Gosvami. Such liberated souls are
disinterested in the affairs of this material world because they are self-
satisfied by the great achievements of devotional service. As explained
before, Sukadeva Gosvami never accepted any formal spiritual master,
nor did he undergo any formal reformatory performances. His father,
Vyasadeva, was his natural spiritual master because he heard Srimad-
Bhagavatam from him. After this, he became completely self-satisfied.


--- Page 351 ---
1016 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 19
Thus he was not dependent on any formal process. The formal processes
are necessary for those who are expected to reach the stage of complete
liberation, but Sri Sukadeva Gosvami was already in that status by the
grace of his father. As a young boy he was expected to be properly dressed,
but he went about naked and was disinterested in social customs. He was
neglected by the general populace, and inquisitive boys and women sur-
rounded him as if he were a madman. He thus appears on the scene while
traveling on the earth on his own accord. It appears that to the inquiry of
Maharaja Pariksit, the great sages were not unanimous in their decision as
to what was to be done. For spiritual salvation there were many prescrip-
tions according to the different modes of different persons. But the
ultimate aim of life is to attain the highest perfectional stage of devotional
service of the Lord. As doctors differ, so also sages differ in their different
prescriptions. While such things were going on, the great powerful son of
Vyasadeva appeared on the scene.

A respectable personality is described beginning with the legs, and this
honored system is observed here with Sukadeva Gosvami. He was only
sixteen years of age. A person is honored for his achievements and not for
advanced age. A person can be older by experience and not by age. Sri
Sukadeva Gosvami, who is described herein as the son of Vyasadeva, was
by his knowledge more experienced than all the sages present there, al-
though he was only sixteen years old.

His bodily features indicate him to be different from common men. All
the signs described in connection with the bodily features of Sukadeva
Gosvami are uncommon symptoms, typical of great personalities, according

Krsna, who is the Supreme amongst the gods, demigods, and all living
beings.

Maharaja Pariksit, who is also known as Visnurata [one who is always
protected by Visnu], bowed his head to receive the chief guest, Sukadeva
Gosvami. At that time all the ignorant women and boys ceased following
Srila Sukadeva. Receiving respect from all, Sukadeva Gosvami took his
exalted seat.
PURPORT
On Sukadeva Gosvami’s arrival at the meeting, everyone, except Srila
Vyasadeva, Narada and a few others, stood up, and Maharaja Pariksit, who
was glad to receive a great devotee of the Lord, bowed down before him
with all the limbs of his body. Sukadeva Gosvami also exchanged the
greetings and reception by embrace, shaking of hands, nodding and bowing
down, especially before his father and Narada Muni. Thus he was offered
the presidential seat at the meeting. When he was so received by the king
and sages, the street boys and less intelligent women who followed him
were struck with wonder and fear. So they retired from their frivolous ac-
tivities, and everything was full of gravity and calm.

TRANSLATION
Sukadeva Gosvami was then surrounded by saintly sages and demigods
just as the moon is surrounded by stars, planets and other heavenly bodies.
His presence was gorgeous, and he was respected by all.
PURPORT
In the great assembly of saintly personalities, there was Vyasadeva the
brahmarsi, Narada the devarsi, Parasurama the great ruler of the ksatriya
kings, etc. Some of them were powerful incarnations of the Lord. Sukadeva
Gosvami was not known as brahmarsi, rdjarsi or devarsi, nor was he an
incarnation like Narada, Vyasa or Parasurama, etc. And yet he excelled
them in respects paid. This means that the devotee of the Lord is more
honored in the world than the Lord Himself. One should, therefore, never
minimize the importance of a devotee like Sukadeva Gosvami.

TRANSLATION
The sage Sri Sukadeva Gosvami sat perfectly pacified, intelligent and
ready to answer any question without hesitation. The great devotee,
Maharaja Pariksit, approached him, offered his respects by bowing before
him, and politely inquired with sweet words and folded hands.
PURPORT
The gesture now adopted by Maharaja Pariksit of questioning a master
is quite befitting in terms of scriptural injunctions. The scriptural injunc-
tion is that one should humbly approach a spiritual master to understand
the transcendental science. Maharaja Pariksit was now prepared for meeting
his death, and within the very short time of seven days he was to know the
process of entering the kingdom of God. In such important cases, one is
required to approach a spiritual master. There is no necessity of approach-
ing a spiritual master unless one is in need of solving the problems of life.
One who does not know how to put questions before the spiritual master
has no business to see him. And the qualification of the spiritual master is
perfectly manifested in the person of hate Gosvami. Both the spiritual
master and the disciple, namely Sri Sukadeva Gosvami and Maharaja
Pariksit, attained perfection through the medium of Srimad-Bhagavatam.
Sukadeva Gosvami learned Srimad-Bhdgavatam from his father Vyasadeva,
but he had no chance to recite it. Before Maharaja Pariksit he recited
Srimad-Bhagavatam and answered the questions of Maharaja Pariksit un-
hesitatingly, and thus both the master and the disciple got salvation.

TRANSLATION

The fortunate King Pariksit said: O brahmana, by your mercy only
you have sanctified us, making us like unto places of pilgrimage, all by
your presence here as my guest. By your mercy, we, who are but unworthy
royalty, become eligible to serve the devotee.

PURPORT

Saintly devotees like Sukadeva Gosvami generally do not approach
worldly enjoyers, especially those in royal orders. Maharaja Prataparudra
was a follower of Lord Caitanya, but when he wanted to see the Lord, the
Lord refused to see him because he was a king. For a devotee who desires
to go back to Godhead, two things are strictly prohibited: worldly enjoyers
and women. Therefore, devotees of the standard of Sukadeva Gosvami are
never interested in seeing kings. Maharaja Pariksit was, of course, a different
case. He was a great devotee, although a king, and therefore Sukadeva
Gosvami came to see him in his last stage of life. Maharaja Pariksit, out of
his devotional humility, felt himself an unworthy descendant of his great
ksatriya forefathers, although he was as great as his predecessors. The
unworthy sons of the royal orders are called ksatra-bandhavas, as the
unworthy sons of the brahmanas are called dvija-bandhus or brahma-

bandhus. Maharaja Pariksit was greatly encouraged by the presence of
Sukadeva Gosvami. He felt himself sanctified by the presence of the great
saint whose presence turns any place into a place of pilgrimage.

TRANSLATION
Simply by remembering you our houses become instantly sanctified.
And what to speak of seeing you, touching you, washing your holy feet
and offering you a seat in our home?
PURPORT

The importance of holy places of pilgrimage is due to the presence of
great sages and saints. It is said that sinful persons go to the holy places
and leave their sins there to accumulate. But the presence of the great
saints disinfects the accumulated sins, and thus the holy places continue
to remain sanctified by the grace of the devotees and saints present there.
If such saints appear in the homes of worldly people, certainly the
accumulated sins of such worldly enjoyers become neutralized. Therefore,
the holy saints actually have no self-interest with the householders. The
only aim of such saints is to sanctify the houses of the householders, and
the householders therefore should feel grateful when such saints and sages
appear at their doors. A householder who dishonors such holy orders is a
great offender. It is enjoined, therefore, that a householder who does not
bow down before a saint at once must undergo fasting for the day in order
to neutralize the great offense.

immediately; nasyanti—vanquished; vai—certainly; pumsam—of a person;
vispoh—like the presence of the Personality of Godhead; iva—like; sura-
itarah— other than the demigods.
TRANSLATION
Just as the atheist cannot remain in the presence of the Personality of
Godhead, so also the invulnerable sins of a man are immediately vanquished
in your presence, O saint! O great mystic!
PURPORT
There are two classes of human beings, namely the atheist and the
devotee of the Lord. The devotee of the Lord, because of manifesting
godly qualities, is called a demigod, whereas the atheist is called a demon.
The demon cannotstand the presence of Visnu the Personality of Godhead.
The demons are always busy in trying to vanquish the Personality of
Godhead, but factually as soon as the Personality of Godhead appears,
either by His transcendental name, form, attributes, pastimes, paraphernalia
or variegatedness, the demon is at once vanquished. It is said that a ghost
cannot remain as soon as the holy name of the Lord is chanted. The great
saints and devotees of the Lord are in the list of His paraphernalia, and
thus as soon as a saintly devotee is present, the ghostly sins are at once
vanquished. That is the verdict of all Vedic literatures. One is recommended,
therefore, to associate only with saintly devotees so that worldly demons
and ghosts cannot exert their sinister influence.

api—definitely; me—unto me; bhagavan—the Personality of Godhead;

priyah—dear; paitr—in relation with the father; svaseya—the sons of the
sister; priti—satisfaction; artham—in the matter of; tat—their; gotrasya— of

TRANSLATION
Lord Krsna, the Personality of Godhead, who is very dear to the sons
of King Pindu, has accepted me as one of those relatives just to please His
great cousins and brothers.
PURPORT

A pure and exclusive devotee of the Lord serves his family interest more
dexterously than others who are attached to illusory family affairs.
Generally people are attached to family matters, and the whole economic
impetus of human society is moving under the influence of family affec-
tion. Such deluded persons have no information that one can render better
service to the family by becoming a devotee of the Lord. The Lord gives
special protection to the family members and descendants of a devotee, even
though such members are themselves nondevotees! Maharaja Prahlada was
a great devotee of the Lord, but his father Hiranyakasipu was a great atheist
and declared enemy of the Lord. But despite all this, Hiranyakasipu was
awarded salvation due to his being the father of Maharaja Prahlada.
The Lord is so kind that he gives all protection to the family members
of His devotee, and thus the devotee has no need to bother about his
family members, even if such family members are left aside to discharge
devotional service. Maharaja Yudhisthira and his brothers were the sons of
Kunti, the paternal aunt of Lord Krsna, and Maharaja Pariksit admits the
patronage of Lord Krsna because of his being the only grandson of the
great Pandavas.

TRANSLATION
Otherwise [without being inspired by Lord Krsna] how is it that you
have voluntarily appeared here, though you are moving incognito to the
common man and are not visible to us who are on the verge of death.
PURPORT
The great sage Sukadeva Gosvami was certainly inspired by Lord Krsna
to appear voluntarily before Maharaja Pariksit, the great devotee of the
Lord, just to give him the teachings of Srimad-Bhagavatam. One can
achieve the nucleus of devotional service of the Lord by the mercy of the
spiritual master and the Personality of Godhead. The spiritual master is
the manifested representative of the Lord to help one achieve ultimate
success. One who is not authorized by the Lord cannot become a spiritual
master. Srila Sukadeva Gosvami is an authorized spiritual master, and
thus he was inspired by the Lord to appear before Maharaja Pariksit and
instruct him in the teachings of Srimad-Bhagavatam. One can achieve the
ultimate success of going back to Godhead if he is favored by the Lord’s
sending His true representative. As soon as a true representative of the
Lord is met by a devotee of the Lord, the devotee is assured a guarantee
for going back to Godhead just after leaving the present body. This,
however, depends on the sincerity of the devotee himself. The Lord is
seated in the heart of all living beings, and thus he knows very well the
movements of all individual persons. As soon as the Lord finds that a


--- Page 362 ---
Text 37] Appearance of Sukadeva Gosvami 1027
particular soul is very eager to go back to Godhead, the Lord at once sends
His bona fide representative. The sincere devotee is thus assured by the
Lord of going back to Godhead. The conclusion is that to get the assis-
tance and help of a bona fide spiritual master means to receive the direct
help of the Lord Himself.

TRANSLATION
You are the spiritual master of great saints and devotees. I am there-
fore begging you to show the way of perfection for all persons, and
especially for one who is about to die.
PURPORT

Unless one is perfectly anxious to inquire about the way of perfection,
there is no necessity of approaching a spiritual master. A spiritual master
is not a kind of decorz.ion for a householder. Generally a fashionable
materialist engages a so-called spiritual master without any profit. The
psuedo-spiritual master flatters the so-called disciple, and thereby both
the master and his ward go to hell without a doubt. Maharaja Pariksit is
the right type of disciple because he puts forward questions vital to the
interest of all men, particularly for the dying men. The question put
forward by Maharaja Pariksit is the basic principle of the complete thesis
of Srimad-Bhagavatam. Now let us see how intelligently the great master
replies.

TRANSLATION
0 powerful brahmana, it is said that you hardly stay in the houses of
men long enough to milk a cow.
PURPORT
Saints and sages in the renounced order of life go to the houses of the
householders at the time they milk the cows, early in the moming, and


--- Page 364 ---
Text 40] Appearance of Sukadeva Gosvami 1029
ask some quantity of milk for subsistence. A pound of milk fresh from the
milk bag of a cow is sufficient to feed an adult with all vitamin values, and
therefore saints and sages live only on milk. Even the poorest of the house-
holders keep at least ten cows, each delivering twelve to twenty quarts of
milk, and therefore no one hesitates to spare a few pounds of milk for
the mendicants. It is the duty of householders to maintain the saints and
sages, like the children. So a saint like Sukadeva Gosvami would hardly
stay at the house of a householder for more than five minutes in the
morning. In other words, such saints are very rarely seen in the houses of
householders, and Maharaja Pariksit therefore prayed to him to instruct
him as soon as possible. The householders also should be intelligent enough
to get some transcendental information from visiting sages. The house-
holder should not foolishly ask a saint to deliver what is available in the
market. That should be the reciprocal relation between the saints and the
householders.

] EXPLANATION OF THE COVER
hy 1. The original spiritual planet, which resembles the whorl
i of a huge lotus flower, is called Goloka Vrndavana. It is the
abode of Lord Krsna, the original Personality of Godhead.

2. This original planet Goloka throws off a spiritual ray of
effulgence called brahimajyoti which is the ultimate goal of
the impersonalists.

3. Within this unlimited brafimafyoti there are unlimited

(1 numbers of spiritual planets, as there are innumerable
= material planets within the sun rays of the material universes.
y These spiritual planets are dominated by plenary expansions
# | of Lord Krsna, and the inhabitants there are ever liberated
4 living beings. They are all four-handed. The Lord is known
there as Narayana, and the planets are known as Vaikunthas.

4. Sometimes a spiritual cloud overtakes a corner of the
spiritual sky of brahimajyoti, and the covered portion is
called the mahat-tattva. The Lord then, by His portion as
Maha-Visnu, lies down in the water within the mahat-

3 tattva. The water is called the Causal Ocean (k3rana-jala).

5. As He sleeps within the Causal Ocean, innumerable
universes are generated with His breathing. These floating
universes are scattered all over the Causal Ocean. They stay
during a breath of Maha-Visnu.

E | 6. In each and every universal globe the same Maha-Visnu
व enters again as GarbhodakasayT Visnu and lies there on the
Garbha Ocean on the serpentine Sesa incarnation. From His
navel-abdomen sprouts a lotus stem, and on the lotus,
Brahma, the lord of the universe, is born. Brahma creates
all living beings of different shapes in terms of desire within
the universe. He also creates the sun, moon and other demi-
= gods.

7. The sun is situated almost in the center of each and
every universe, and it distributes profuse light and heat all
over the universe. There are millions and billions of suns in
all the millions and billions of universes within the mahat-
tattva. The suns and moons are required within the universes
because they are dark by nature. The Vedas instruct us to go |
out of the dark universes and reach the glowing effulgence,
the brahimajyoti. 1
8. The brahmajyoti is due to the illuminating Vaikuntha
planets, which need no sun or moon or power of electricity.
Srimad-Bhagavatarn helps us reach the supreme planet, #
Goloka Vrndavana. The door is open for everyone. Human
life is meant for this particular aim, for it is the highest
perfection. ह|

His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swarni Prabhupada
first met his spiritual master, Srila Bhak tisiddhanta Sarasvati
Gosvamt Maharaja, in Calcutta in 1922. Srila Bhaktisiddhanta
liked this educated young man and injected in him the idea
of preaching the message of Srirmad-Bhagavatam all over the
world. At Allahabad in 1933 Srila Prabhupada became his
formally initiated disciple, and in 1937, just days before
Srila Bhaktisiddhanta’s departure from this mortal world, he
was specifically ordered to spread Krsna consciousness in the
English language. Thus in 1944 Srila Prabhupada started
Back .to Godhead magazine, which is now circulated in six
different languages throughout the world, and he also pub-
lished, in English, the first three volumes of his Srimad-
Bhagavatam.
In 1965, at the advanced age of 70, His Divine Grace
sailed to the United States to fulfill his master’s sacred
mission, bringing with him only seven dollars, some books
and a pair of hand cymbals. Shortly afterwards he began
classes on Bhagavad-gits in a small storefront in New York
City. Now, only six years later, Srila Prabhupada’s Inter-
national Society for Krishna Consciousness, with more than
seventy centers in major cities throughout the world, has
become an important institution of spiritual knowledge and
culture, and Srila Prabhupada’s authoritative translations,
commentaries and summary studies of Vedic literature have
become standard textbooks of transcendental science.
