CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
Victory of Hiranyaksa Over
All the Directions of the Universe

maitre yah—the sage Maitreya; uvdca—said; nisamya—upon hearing; atma-
bhuva—by Brahma; gitam—explanation; karapam—the cause; Sankayia—
from fear; ujjhitah—freed; tatah—then; sarve—all; nyavartanta—returned;
tridivaya—to the heavenly planets; diva-okasah—the demigods (who inhabit
the higher planets).
TRANSLATION
Sri Maitreya said: The demigods, the inhabitants of the higher planets,
were freed from all fear upon hearing the cause of the darkness explained
by Brahma, who was born from Visnu. Thus they all returned to their
respective planets.
PURPORT
The demigods, who are denizens of higher planets, are also very much
afraid of incidents such as the universe’s becoming dark, and so they
consulted Brahma. This indicates that the quality of fear exists for every
living entity in the material world. The four principal activities of material
677


--- Page 2 ---
678 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 17
existence are eating, sleeping, fearing and mating. The fear element exists
also in the demigods. On every planet,even in the higher planetary systems,
including the moon and the sun, as well as on this earth, the same principles
of animal life exist. Otherwise, why are the demigods also afraid of the
darkness? The difference between the demigods and ordinary human
beings is that the demigods approach authority, whereas the inhabitants of
this earth defy authority. If people would only approach the authority, then
every adverse condition in this universe could be rectified. Arjuna was
also disturbed on the Battlefield of Kurukgetra, but he approached the
authority, Krsna, and his problem was solved. The conclusive instruction
of this incident is that we may be disturbed by some material condition,
but if we approach the authority who can actually explain the matter, then
our problem is solved. The demigods approached Brahma for the meaning
of the disturbance, and after hearing from him they were satisfied and
returned home peacefully.

TRANSLATION
There were earthquakes along the mountains on the earth, and it
appeared that there was fire everywhere. Many inauspicious planets like
Saturn appeared, along with comets, meteors and thunderbolts.
PURPORT
When natural disturbances occur on a planet, one should understand `
that a demon must have taken birth there. In the present age the number
of demoniac people is increasing; therefore natural disturbances are also

increasing. There is no doubi about this as we can understand 1110111 the
statements of the Bhagavatam.

TRANSLATION
There blew winds which were most uninviting to the touch, hissing
again and again and uprooting gigantic trees. They had storms for their
armies and clouds of dust for their ensigns.
PURPORT
When there are natural disturbances like blowing cyclones, too much
heat or snowfall, and uprooting of trees by hurricanes, it is to be under-
stood that the demoniac population is increasing and so the natural
disturbance is also taking place. There are many countries on the globe,
even at the present moment, where all these disturbances are current. This
is true all over the world. There is no sufficient sunshine, and there are
always clouds in the sky, snowfall and severe cold. These assure that such
places are inhabited by demoniac people who are accustomed to all kinds
of forbidden sinful activity.

Asses also feel very respectable as a race, and when they run in flocks
hither and thither in so-called jollity, it is understood to be a bad sign for
human society.

TRANSLATION
Ominous planets such as Mars and Saturn shone brighter and surpassed
the auspicious ones such as Mercury, Jupiter and Venus as well as a number
of lunar mansions. Taking seemingly retrograde courses, the planets came
in conflict with one another.
PURPORT
The entire universe is moving under the three modes of material nature.
Those living entities who are in goodness are called the pious species— pious
lands, pious trees, etc. It is similar with the planets also; many planets are
considered pious, and others are considered impious. Saturn and Mars are
considered impious. When the pious planets shine very brightly, it is an
auspicious sign, but when the inauspicious planets shine very brightly, this
is not a very good sign.

686 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 17
TRANSLATION

Marking these and many other omens of evil times, everyone but the
four sage sons of Brahma, who were aware of the fall of Jaya and Vijaya
and of their births as Diti’s sons, was seized with fear. They did not know
the secrets of these portents and thought that the dissolution of the universe
was at hand.

PURPORT ध

According to Bhagavad-gita, Seventh Chapter, the laws of nature are so
stringent that it is impossible for the living entity to surpass their enforce-
ment. It is also explained that only those who are fully surrendered to
Krsna in Krsna consciousness can be saved. We can learn from the descrip-
tion of the Srimad-Bhagavatam that it is because of the birth of two great
demons that there were so many natural disturbances. It is to be indirectly
understood, as previously described, that when there are constant distur-
bances on the earth, that is an omen that some demoniac people have been
born or that the demoniac population has increased. In former days there
were only two demons, those born of Diti, yet there were so many
disturbances. At the present day, especially in this age of Kali, these
disturbances are always visible, which indicates that the demoniac popu-
lation has certainly increased.

To check the increase of demoniac population, the Vedic civilization
enacted so many rules and regulations of social life, the most important of
which is the garbhadana process for begetting good children. In Bhagavad-
gita Arjuna informed Krsna that if there is unwanted population (varna-
saitkara), the entire world will appear to be hell. People are very anxious
for peace in the world, but there are so many unwanted children born
without the benefit of the garbhadana ceremony, just like the demons born
from Diti. Diti was so lusty that she forced her husband to copulate at a
time which was inauspicious, and therefore the demons were born to
create disturbances. In having sex life to beget children, one should observe
the process for begetting nice children; if each and every householder in
every family observes the Vedic system, then there are nice children, not
demons, and automatically there is peace in the world. If we do not follow
regulations in life for social tranquility, we cannot expect peace. Rather,
we will have to undergo the stringent reactions of natural laws.

TRANSLATION
These two demons who appeared in ancient times soon began to exhibit
uncommon bodily features; they had steel-like frames which began to
grow just like two great mountains.
PURPORT
There are two classes of men in the world; one is called the demon, and
the other is called the demigod. The demigods concern themselves with the
spiritual upliftment of human society, whereas the demons are concerned
with physical "and material upliftment. The two demons born of Diti
began to make their bodies as strong as iron frames, and they were so tall
that they seemed to touch outer space. They were decorated with valuable
ornaments, and they thought that this was success in life. Originally it was
planned that Jaya and Vijaya, the two doorkeepers of Vaikuntha, were to
take birth in this material world, where, by the curse of the sages, they were
to play the part of always being angry with the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. As demoniac persons they became so angry that they were not
concerned with the Supreme Personality of Godhead but simply with
physical comforts and physical upliftment.

TRANSLATION
Their bodies became so tall that they seemed to kiss the sky with the
crests of their gold crowns. They blocked the view of all directions and
while walking shook the earth at every step. Their arms were adorned with
brilliant bracelets, and they stood as if covering the sun with their waists,
which were bound with excellent and beautiful girdles.
PURPORT
In the demoniac way of civilization, people are interested in getting a
body constructed in such a way that when they walk on the street the earth
will tremble and when they stand it will appear that they cover the sun and
the vision of the four directions. If a race appears strong in body, their
country is materially considered to be among the highly advanced nations
of the world.

Kasyapa, Prajapati, the creater of the living ला 1111९685, gave his twin sons
their names; the one who was born first he named Hiranyaksa, and the one
who was first conceived by Diti he named Hiranyakasipu.

PURPORT

There is an authoritative Vedic literature called Pinda-siddhi in which the
scientific understanding of pregnancy is very nicely described. It is stated
that when the male secretion enters the menstrual flux in the uterus in two
successive drops, the mother develops two embryos in her womb, and she
brings forth twins in a reverse order to that in which they were first
conceived; the child conceived first is born later, and the one conceived
later is brought forth first. The first child conceived in the womb lives
behind the second child, so when birth takes place the second child appears
first, and the first child appears second. In this case it is understood that
Hiranyaksa, the second child conceived, was delivered first, whereas
HiranyakaSipu, the child who was behind him, having been conceived
first, was born second.

690 S$rimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 17
TRANSLATION

The elder child, Hiranyakasipu, was not afraid of death from anyone
within the three worlds because he had received a benediction from Lord
Brahma. He was proud and puffed up due to this benediction and was able
to bring all three planetary systems under his control.

PURPORT

As will be revealed in later chapters, Hiranyakasipu underwent severe
austerity and penance to satisfy Brahma and thus receive a benediction
of immortality. Actually it is impossible even for Lord Brahma to give
anyone the benediction of becoming immortal, but indirectly Hiranya-
kasipu received the benediction that no one within this material world
would be able to kill him. In other words, because he originally came
from the abode of Vaikuntha, he was not to be killed by anyone within
this material world. The Lord desired to appear Himself to kill him. One
may be very proud of his material advancement in knowledge, but he
cannot be immune to the four principles of material existence, namely
birth, death, old age and disease. It was the Lord’s plan to teach people
that even Hiranyakadipu, who was so powerful and strongly built, could
not live more than his destined duration of life. One may become as strong
and puffed up as Hiranyakadipu and bring under his control all the three
worlds, but there is no possibility of continuing life eternally or keeping
the conquered booty forever. So many emperors have ascended to power,
and they are now lost in oblivion; that is the history of the world.

Text 22] The Victory of Hiranyaksa 691
TRANSLATION
His younger brother, Hiranyaksa, was always ready to satisfy his elder
brother by his activities; he took a club on his shoulder and traveled all
over the universe with a fighting spirit just to satisfy him.
PURPORT
The demoniac spirit is to train all family members to exploit the resources
of this universe for personal sense gratification, whereas the godly spirit is
to engage everything in the service of the Lord. Hiranyakadipu was himself
very powerful, and he made his younger brother Hiranyaksa powerful 10
assist him in fighting with everyone and lording it over material nature as
long as possible. If possible, he wanted to rule the universe eternally. These
are demonstrations of the spirit of the demoniac living entity.

His mental and bodily strength as well as the boon conferred upon him
had made him proud. He feared death at the hands of no one, and there
was no checking him. The gods, therefore, were seized with fear at his very
sight, and they hid themselves even as snakes hide themselves for fear of
Garuda.
PURPORT
The asuras are generally strongly built, as described here, and therefore
their mental condition is very sound, and their prowess is also extra-
ordinary. Hiranyaksa and Hiranyakasipu, having received the boon that
they would not be killed by any other living entity within this universe,
were almost immortal, and thus they were completely fearless.

On not finding Indra and the other demigods, who had previously been
intoxicated with power, the chief of the Daityas, seeing that they had all
vanished before his might, roared loudly.

TRANSLATION
On his entering the ocean, the aquatic animals who formed the host of
Varuna were stricken with fear and ran far away. Thus Hiranyaksa showed
his splendor without dealing a blow.
PURPORT
Materialistic demons sometimes appear to be very powerful and are seen
to establish their supremacy throughout the world. Here also it appears
that Hiranyaksa, by his demoniac strength, actually established his
supremacy throughout the universe, and the demigods were afraid of his
uncommon power. Not only were the demigods in space afraid of the
demons Hiranyakasipu and Hiranyaksa, but so also were the aquatic animals
within the sea.

Varuna is supposed to be the predominating deity of the waters, and

Then he reached the Vibhavari, the home of Varuna, the lord of the
aquatic creatures and the guardian of the lower regions of the universe
where the demons generally reside. He fell there at the latter's feet like a
lowborn man, and to make fun of him he said with a smile, ‘Give me
battle, O Supreme Lord!”
PURPORT
The demoniac person always challenges others and tries to occupy
others’ property by force. Here these symptoms are fully displayed by
Hiranyaksa, who begged war from a person who had no desire to fight.

Thus mocked by an enemy whose vanity knew no bounds, the
worshipful lord of the waters waxed angry, but by dint of his reason he
managed to curb the anger that had sprung up in him, and he replied:
O dear one, we have now desisted from warfare, having grown too old for
combat.
PURPORT
As we see, warmongering materialists always create fighting without
reason.

Therefore, O chief of the asuras, approach Him, whom even heroes like you
mention with praise.
PURPORT
Aggressive materialistic warriors are actually punished by the Supreme
Lord for their policy of unnecessarily disturbing world peace. Therefore
Varuna advised Hiranyaksa that the right course to satisfy his fighting
spirit would be to seek to fight with Vispu.

Varuna continued: On reaching Him you will be rid of your pride at
once and will lie down on the field of battle, surrounded by dogs, for
eternal sleep. It is in order to exterminate wicked fellows like you and to
show His grace to the virtuous that He assumes His various incarnations
like Varaha.
PURPORT
Asuras do not know that their bodies consist of the five elements of
material nature and that when they fall they become objects of pastimes
for dogs and vultures. Varuna advised Hiranydksa to meet Visnu in His
boar incarnation so that his hankering for aggressive war would be satis-
fied and his powerful body would be vanquished.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Third Canto, Seventeenth
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled, “Victory of Hiranyaksa
Over All the Directions of the Universe.”

PURPORT
Materialistic warmongers are not even afraid to fight with their mightiest
enemy, the Personality of Godhead. The demon was very encouraged to
learn from Varuna that there was one fighter who could actually combat
him, and he was very enthusiastic to search out the Supreme Personality
of Godhead just to give Him a fight, even though it was predicted by
Varuna that by fighting with Visnu he would become prey for dogs,
jackals and vultures. Since demoniac persons are less intelligent, they dare
to fight with Visnu, who is known as Ajita, or one who has never been
conquered.

He saw there the all-powerful Personality of Godhead in His boar

robbing him of his splendor with His reddish eyes. The demon laughed:
0, an amphibious beast!
PURPORT
In a previous chapter we have discussed the incarnation of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead as Varaha, the boar. While Varaha, with His tusks,


--- Page 25 ---
Text 3] The Battle Between Lord Boar and Hiranyaksa 701
engaged in uplifting the submerged earth from the depths of the waters,
this great demon Hiranyaksa met Him and challenged Him, calling Him a
beast. Demons cannot understand the incarnations of the Lord; they think
that His incarnations as a fish or boar or tortoise are big beasts only. They
misunderstand the body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, even in
His human form, and they deride His descent. In the Caitanya-sampradaya
there is sometimes a demoniac misconception about the descent of
Nityananda Prabhu. Nityananda Prabhu’s body is spiritual, but demoniac
persons consider the body of the Supreme Personality to be material, just
like ours. Avajananti mam mudhah: persons who have no intelligence
deride the transcendental form of the Lord as material.

TRANSLATION

The demon addressed the Lord: O best of the demigods, dressed in the
form of a boar, just hear me. This earth is entrusted to us, the inhabitants
of the lower regions, and You cannot take it from my presence and not be
hurt by me.

PURPORT

Sridhara Svami, commenting on this verse, states that although the

demon wanted to deride the Personality of Godhead in the form of a


--- Page 26 ---
702 $rimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 18
boar, actually he worshiped Him in several words. For example, he
addressed Him as vana-gocarah, which means one who is a resident of the
forest, but another meaning of vana-gocarah is one who lies on the water.
Visnu lies on the water, so the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be
properly addressed in this way. The demon also addressed Him as
mrgah, indicating, unintentionally, that the Supreme Personality is sought
after by great sages, saintly persons and transcendentalists. He also
addressed Him as ajiia. Sridhara Svam says that jiia means knowledge and
there is no knowledge which is unknown to the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Indirectly, therefore, the demon said that Visnu knows every-
thing. He addressed Him as suradhama. Sura means the demigods, and
adhama means Lord of all there is. He is Lord of all the demigods; there-
fore He is the best of all demigods, or God. When the demon used the
phrase “in my presence,” the implied meaning was: “In spite of my
presence, You are completely able to take away the earth.” Na svasti
yasyasi: “Unless You kindly take this earth from our custody, there can
be no good fortune for us.”

--- Page 27 ---
Text 5] The Battle Between Lord Boar and Hiranyaksa 703
PURPORT

The demon used the word abhavaya, which means for killing. Sridhara
Svami comments that this *“killing” means liberating, or, in other words
killing the process of continued birth and death. The Lord kills the process
of birth and death and keeps Himself invisible. The activities of the Lord’s
internal potency are inconceivable, but by a slight exhibition of this
potency, the Lord, by His grace, can deliver one from nescience. Sucah
means miseries; the miseries of material existence can be extinguished by
the Lord by His potential energy of internal yogamdyd. In the Upanisads
(Svet. 6.8) it is stated, pardsya saktir vividhaiva $riyate. The Lord is in-
visible to the eyes of the common man, but His energies act in various
ways. When demons are in adversity, they think that God is hiding Himself
and is working by His mystic potency. They think that if they can find
God they can kill Him just by seeing Him. Hiranyaksa thought that way,
and he challenged the Lord: “You have done tremendous harm to our
community, taking the part of the demigods, and You have killed our
kinsmen in so many ways, always keeping Yourself hidden. Now I see You
face to face, and I am not going to let You go. I shall kill You and save my
kinsmen from Your mystic misdeeds.”

Demons are not only always anxious to kill God with words and
philosophy, but they think that if one is materially powerful he can kill
God with materially fatal weapons. Demons like Kamsa, Ravana and
Hiranyakadipu thought themselves powerful enough to kill even God.
Demons cannot understand that God, by His multifarious potencies, can
work so wonderfully that He can be present everywhere and still remain
in His eternal abode, Goloka Vrndavana.

TRANSLATION

The demon continued: When You fall dead with Your skull smashed by
the mace hurled by my arms, the demigods and sages who offer You obla-
tions and sacrifice in devotional service will also automatically cease to
exist, like trees without roots.

PURPORT

Demons are very much disturbed when devotees worship the Lord in
the prescribed ways recommended in the scriptures. In the Vedic scriptures,
the neophyte devotees are advised to engage in nine kinds of devotional
service, such as to hear and chant the holy name of God, to remember
Him always, to chant on beads Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare
Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, to worship the
Lord in the form of His Deity incarnation in the temples, and to engage in
various activities of Krsna consciousness to increase the number of godly
persons for perfect peace in the world. Demons do not like such activity.
They are always envious of God and His devotees. Their propaganda not
to worship in the temple or church but simply to make material advance-
ment for satisfaction of the senses is always current. The demon Hiranyaksa,
upon seeing the Lord face to face, wanted to make a permanent solution
by killing the Personality of Godhead with his powerful mace. The example
of an uprooted tree mentioned here by the demon is very significant.
Devotees accept that God is the root of everything. Their example is that
just as the stomach is the source of energy of all the limbs of the body, so
God is the original source of all energy manifested in the material and
spiritual worlds; therefore, as supplying food to the stomach is the process
to satisfy all the limbs of the body, so Krsna consciousness or developing
love of Krsna is the sublime method for satisfying the source of all happi-
ness. The demon wants to uproot this source because if the root, God,
were to be checked, the activities of the Lord and the devotees would
automatically stop. The demon would be very much satisfied by such a
situation in society. Demons are always anxious lo have a godless society
for their sense gratification. According to Sridhara Svam, this verse means


--- Page 29 ---
Text 6] The Battle Between Lord Boar and Hiranyaksa 705
that when the demon was deprived of his mace by the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, not only the neophyte devotees but also the ancient sagacious
devotees of the Lord would be very much satisfied.

TRANSLATION
Although the Lord was pained by the shaftlike abusive words of the
demon, He bore the pain. But seeing that the earth on the ends of His tusks
was frightened, He rose out of the water just as an elephant emerges
with his female companion when assailed by an alligator.
PURPORT
The Mayavadi philosopher cannot understand that the Lord has feelings.
The Lord is satisfied if someone offers Him a nice prayer, and similarly, if
someone decries His existence or calls Him by ill names, God is dissatisfied.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is decried by the Mayavadi philo-
sophers, who are almost demons. They say that God has no head, no form,
no existence and no legs, hands or other bodily limbs. In other words, they
say that He is dead or lame. All these misconceptions of the Supreme
Lord are a source of dissatisfaction to Him; He is never pleased with such


--- Page 30 ---
706 $rimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 18
atheistic descriptions. In this case, although the Lord felt sorrow from the
piercing words of the demon, He delivered the earth for the satisfaction of
the demigods, who are ever His devotees. The conclusion is that God is as
sentient as we are. He is satisfied by our prayers and dissatisfied by our
harsh words against Him. In order to give protection to His devotee, He is
always ready to tolerate insulting words from the atheists.

TRANSLATION
The demon, who had golden hair on his head and fearful tusks, gave
chase to the Lord while He was rising from the water, even as an alligator
would chase an elephant. Roaring like thunder, he said: Are You not
ashamed of running away before a challenging adversary? There is nothing
reproachable for shameless creatures!
PURPORT
When the Lord was coming out of the water, taking the earth in His
arms to deliver it, the demon derided Him with insulting words, but the
Lord did not care because He was very conscious of His duty. For a dutiful
man there is nothing to fear. Similarly, those who are powerful have no

Text 8] The Battle Between Lord Boar and Hiranyaksa 707
fear of derision or unkind words from an enemy. The Lord had nothing to
fear from anyone, yet He was merciful to His enemy by neglecting him.
Although apparently He fled from the challenge, it was just to protect the
earth from calamity that He tolerated Hiranyaksa’s deriding words.

sah—the Lord; gam—the earth; udastat—on the surface; salilasya—of the
water; gocare—within His sight; vinyasya—having placed; tasyam—to the
earth; adadhat—he invested; sva— His own; sattvam—existence; abhistutah—
praised; vi$va-srja—by Brahma (the creator of the universe); prasiinaih—by
flowers; apiryamanah—becoming satisfied; vibudhaih—by the demigods;
pasyatah—while looking on; areh—the enemy.
TRANSLATION
The Lord placed the earth within His sight on the surface of the water
and transferred to her His own energy in the form of the capacity to
float on the water. While the enemy stood looking on, Brahma, the
creator of the universe, extolled the Lord, and the other demigods rained
flowers on Him.
PURPORT
Those who are demons cannot understand how the Supreme Personality
of Godhead floated the earth on water, but to devotees of the Lord this is
not a very wonderful act. Not only the earth but many, many millions of
planets are floating in the air, and this floating power is endowed to them
by the Lord; there is no other possible explanation. The materialists can
explain that the planets are floating by the law of gravitation, but the law
of gravitation works under the control or direction of the Supreme Lord.

708 $rimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 18
That is the version of Bhagavad-gita, which confirms, by the Lord’s state-
ment, that behind the material laws or nature’s laws and behind the
growth, maintenance, production and evolution of all the planetary
systems—behind every thing—is the Lord’s direction. The Lord’s activities
could be appreciated only by the demigods, headed by Brahma, and there-
fore when they saw the uncommon prowess of the Lord in keeping the
earth on the surface of the water, they showered flowers on Him in
appreciation of His transcendental activity.

TRANSLATION |

The demon, who had a wealth of ornaments, bangles and beautiful golden
armor on his body, chased the Lord from behind with a great mace. The
Lord tolerated his piercing ill words, but in order to reply to him, He ex-
pressed His terrible anger.

PURPORT

The Lord could have chastised the demon immediately while he was
deriding the Lord with ill words, but [€ tolerated him to please the demi-
gods and to show that they should not be afraid of demons while dis-
charging their duties. Therefore His toleration was displayed mainly to
drive away the fears of the demigods, who should know that the Lord is

Text 10] The Battle Between Lord Boar and Hiranyaksa 709
always present to protect them. The demon’s derision of the Lord was just
like the barking of dogs; the Lord did not care about it, since He was doing
His own work in delivering the earth from the midst of the water. Material-
istic demons always possess large amounts of gold in various shapes, and
they think that a large amount of gold, physical strength and popularity
can save them from the wrath of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

The Personality of Godhead said: Indeed We are creatures of the jungle,
and We are searching after hunting dogs like you. One who is freed from
the entanglement of death has no fear from the loose talk in which you
are indulging, for you are bound up by the laws of death.
PURPORT
Demons and atheistic persons can go on insulting the Supreme Person-
ality of Godhead, but they forget that they are subjected to the laws of
birth and death. They think that simply by decrying the existence of the
Supreme Lord or defying His stringent laws of nature, one can be freed


--- Page 34 ---
710 $rimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 18
from the clutches of birth and death. In Bhagavad-gita it is said that
simply by understanding the transcendental nature of God one can go
back home, back to Godhead. But demons and atheistic persons do not
try to understand the nature of the Supreme Lord; therefore they remain
in the entanglement of birth and death.

TRANSLATION
Certainly We have stolen the charge of the inhabitants of Rasatala and
have lost all shame. Although bitten by your powerful mace, I shall never-
theless stay here in the water for some time because, having created enmity
with a powerful enemy, I now have no place to go.
PURPORT
The demon should have known that God cannot be driven out of any
place because He is all-pervading. Demons think of their possessions as
their property, but actually everything belongs to the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, who can take anything at any time He likes.

and wipe out the cares of your kith and kin by slaying Us. One may be
proud, yet he does not deserve a seat in an assembly if he fails to fulfill his
promised word.
PURPORT
A demon may be a great soldier and commander of a large number of
infantry, but in the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead he is
powerless and is destined to die. The Lord, therefore, challenged the de-
mon not to go away but to fulfill his promised word to kill Him.

TRANSLATION
Sri Maitreya said: The demon, being thus challenged by the Personality
of Godhead, became angry and agitated, and he trembled in anger like a
challenged cobra. .
PURPORT
A cobra is very fierce before ordinary persons, but before an enchanter
who can play with him, he is a plaything. Similarly, a demon may be very
powerful in his own domain, but before the Lord he is insignificant. The
demon Ravana was a fierce figure before the demigods, but when he was
before Lord Ramacandra he trembled and prayed to his deity, Lord Siva,
but to no avail.

TRANSLATION
The Lord, however, by moving slightly aside, dodged the violent mace
blow aimed at His breast by the enemy, just as an accomplished yogi would
elude death.
PURPORT
The example is given herein that the perfect yogi can overcome a death-
blow although it 15 offered by the laws of nature. It is useless for a demon
to beat the transcendental body of the Lord with a powerful mace because
no one can surpass His prowess. Those who are advanced transcendentalists
are freed from the laws of nature, and even a deathblow cannot act on
them. Superficially it may be seen that a yogi is attacked by a deathblow,
but by the grace of the Lord he can overcome many such attacks for the
service of the Lord. As the Lord exists by 1115 own independent prowess,
৪০ by the grace of the Lord the devotees also exist for His service.

TRANSLATION
There was keen rivalry between the two combatants; both had sustained
injuries on their bodies from the blows of each other’s pointed maces, and
each grew more and more enraged at the smell of blood on his person. In
their eagerness to win, they performed maneuvers of various kinds, and
their contest looked like an encounter between two forceful bulls for the
sake of a cow.
PURPORT
Here the earth planet is called ila. This earth was formerly known as
llavrta-varga, and when Maharaja Pariksit ruled the earth it was called
Bharata-varsa. Actually Bharata-varsa is the name for the entire planet, but
gradually Bharata-varga has come to mean India. As India has recently
been divided into Pakistan and Hindustan, similarly the earth was formerly
called Tlavrta-varsa, but gradually as time passed it was divided by national
boundaries.

Text 21] The Battle Between Lord Boar and Hiranyaksa 717
the sake of the world between the demon and the Personality of Godhead
who appeared in the form of a boar.

PURPORT

The fight between the Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and
the demon is compared to a bullfight for the sake of a cow. The earth
planet is also called go or cow. As bulls fight between themselves to ascer-
tain who will have union with a cow, so there is always a constant fight be-
tween the demon and the Supreme Lord or His representative for supre-
macy over the earth. Here the Lord is significantly described as yajiavayava.
One should not consider the Lord to have the body of an ordinary boar.
He can assume any form, and He possesses all such forms eternally. It 15
from Him that all other forms have emanated. This boar form is not to be
considered the form of an ordinary hog; His body is actually full of yajiia,
or worshipful offerings. Yajiia (sacrifices) are offered to Visnu. Yajia
means the body of Visnu. His body is not material; therefore He should
not be taken to be an ordinary boar.

Bralima is described in this verse as svarat. Actually, full independence
is exclusive to the Lord Himself, but as part and parcel of the Supreme
Lord, every living entity has a minute quantity of independence. Each and
every one of the living entities within this universe has this minute indepen-
dence, but Brahma, being the chief of all living entities, has a greater
potential of independence than any other. He is the representative of
Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and has been assigned to pre-
side over universal affairs. All other demigods work for him; therefore he
is described here as svarat. lle is always accompanied by great sages and
transcendentalists, all of whom came to see the bullfight between the de-
mon and the Lord.

TRANSLATION
Lord Brahma said: My dear Lord, this demon has proved to be a
constant pinprick to the demigods, the brahmanas, the cows and innocent
persons who are spotless and always dependent upon worshiping Your lotus
feet. He has become a source of fear by unnecessarily harassing them.
Since he has attained a boon from me, he has become a demon, always
searching for a proper combatant, wandering all over the universe for this
infamous purpose.
PURPORT
There are two classes of living entities; one is called sura or the demi-
gods, and the other is called asura or the demons. Demons are generally
fond of worshiping the demigods, and there are evidences that by such
worship they get extensive power for their sense gratification. This later
proves to be a cause of trouble to the brahmanas, demigods and other in-
nocent living entities. Demons habitually find fault with the demigods,
brahmanas and innocent, to whom they are a constant source of fear. The
way of the demon is to take power from the demigods and then tease the
demigods themselves. There is an instance of a great devotee of Lord Siva
who obtained a boon from Lord Siva that the head of whomever he
touched with his hand would come off its trunk. As soon as the boon was
offered to him, the demon wanted to touch the very head of Lord Siva.
That is their way. The devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead do
not, however, ask any favor for sense gratification. Even if they are offered
liberation, they refuse it. They are happy simply engaging in the transcen-
dental loving service of the Lord.

TRANSLATION

Lord Brahma continued: My dear Lord, there is no need to play with
this serpentine demon, who is always very skilled in conjuring tricks and
is arrogant, self-sufficient and most wicked.

PURPORT

No one is unhappy when a serpent is killed. It is a practice amongst
village boys to catch a serpent by the tail and play with it for some time
and then kill it. Similarly, the Lord could have killed the demon at once,
but He played with him in the same way as a child plays with a snake be-
fore killing it. Brahma requested, however, that since the demon was more
wicked and undesirable than a serpent, there was no need to play with
him. It was his wish that he be killed at once, without delay.

TRANSLATION
Sri Maitreya said: Hearing the words of Brahma, the creator, which were
free from all sinful purposes and as sweet as nectar, the Lord heartily
laughed and accepted his prayer with a glance laden with love.
PURPORT
The word nirvyalika is very significant. The prayers of the demigods
or devotees of the Lord are free from all sinful purposes, but the prayers
of demons are always filled with sinful purposes. The demon Hiranyaksa
became powerful by deriving a boon from Brahma, and after attaining that
boon he created a disturbance because of his sinful intentions. The prayers
723


--- Page 48 ---
724 $rfimad-Bhagavatam | Canto 3, Ch. 19
of Brahma and other demigods are not to be compared to the prayers of
the demons. Their purpose is to please the Supreme Lord; therefore the
Lord smiled and accepted the prayer to kill the demon. Demons, who are
never interested in praising the Supreme Personality of Godhead because
they have no information of Him, go to the demigods, and in Bhagavad-
gita this is condemned. Persons who go to the demigods and pray for
advancement in sinful activities are considered to be bereft of all intel-
ligence. Demons have lost all intelligence because they do not know what
is actually their self-interest. Even if they have information of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, they decline to approach Him; it is not possible
for them to get their desired boons from the Supreme Lord because
their purposes are always sinful. It is said that the dacoits in Bengal used
to worship the goddess Kali for fulfillment of their sinful desires to plunder
others’ property, but they never went to a Visnu temple because they
might have been unsuccessful in praying to ४151. Therefore the prayers
of the demigods or the devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead
are always untinged by sinful purposes.

TRANSLATION
Hurled by the mighty demon with all his strength, the flying trident
shone brightly in the sky. The Personality of Godhead, however, tore it to
pieces with His discus Sudarsana, which had a sharp-edged rim, even as
Indra cut off a wing of Garuda.
PURPORT
The context of the reference given herein regarding Garuda and Indra is
this. Once upon a time, Garuda, the carrier of the Lord, snatched away a
nectar pot from the hands of the demigods in heaven in order to liberate
his mother, Vinata, from the clutches of his stepmother,Kadri, the mother
of the serpents. On learning of this, Indra, the King of heaven, hurled his
thunderbolt against Garuda. With a view to respect the infallibility of
indra’s weapon, Garuda, though otherwise invincible, being the Lords
own mount, dropped one of his wings, which was shattered to pieces by
the thunderbolt. The inhabitants of higher planets are so sensible that
even in the process of fighting they observe the preliminary rules and
regulations of gentleness. In this case, Garuda wanted to show respect
for Indra; since he knew that Indra’s weapon must destroy something, he
offered his wing.

The demon was enraged when his trident was cut to pieces by the
discus of the Personality of Godhead. He therefore advanced towards
the Lord and, roaring aloud, struck his hard fist against the Lord's
broad chest, which bore the mark of Srivatsa. Then he went out of sight.
PURPORT
Srivatsa is a curl of white hair on the chest of the Lord which is a special
sign of His being the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Vaikunthaloka
or in Goloka Vrndavana, the inhabitants are exactly of the same form as
the Personality of Godhead, but by this Srivatsa mark on the chest of the
Lord He is distinguished from all others.

Text 17] The Killing of the Demon Hiranyaksa 733
TRANSLATION

Hit in this manner by the demon, O Vidura, the Lord, who had appeared
as the first boar, did not feel the least quaking in any part of His body, any
more than an elephant would when struck with a wreath of flowers.

PURPORT

As previously explained, the demon was originally a servitor of the Lord
in Vaikuntha, but somehow or other he fell as a demon. His fight with the
Supreme Lord was meant for his liberation. The Lord enjoyed the striking
on His transcendental body, just like a fully grown-up father fighting with
his child. Sometimes a father takes pleasure in having a mock fight with
his small child, and similarly the Lord felt Hiranyaksa’s striking on His
body to be like flowers offered for worship. In other words, the Lord
desired to fight in order to enjoy His transcendental bliss; therefore He
enjoyed the attack.

TRANSLATION

The demon, however, employed many conjuring tricks against the
Personality of Godhead, who is the Lord of yogamaya. At the sight of
this the people were filled with alarm and thought that the dissolution of
the universe was near.

PURPORT

The fighting enjoyment of the Supreme Lord with His devotee, who

had been converted into a demon, appeared severe enough to bring about


--- Page 58 ---
734 $rimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 19
the dissolution of the universe. This is the greatness of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead; even the wavering of His little finger appears to
be a great and very dangerous movement in the eyes of the inhabitants of
the universe.

TRANSLATION
The Lord, the personal enjoyer of all sacrifices, now discharged His
beloved Sudarsana, which was capable of dispersing the magical forces
displayed by the demon.
PURPORT
Even famous yogis and demons can sometimes enact very magical feats
by their mystic power, but in the presence of the Sudarsana cakra, when
it is let loose by the Lord, all such magical jugglery is dispersed. The
instance of the quarrel between Durvasa Muni and Maharaja Ambarisa is
a practical example in this matter. Durvasa Muni wanted to display many
magical wonders, but when Sudarsana cakra appeared, Durvasa himself
was afraid and fled to various planets for his personal protection. The Lord
is described here as tripat, which means that He is the enjoyer of three
kinds of sacrifices. In Bhagavad-gita the Lord confirms that He is the
beneficiary and enjoyer of all sacrifices, penances and austerities. The
Lord is the enjoyer of three kinds of yajia. As further described in
Bhagavad-gita, there are sacrifices of goods, sacrifices of meditation and
sacrifices of philosophical speculation. Those on the paths of jiiana, yoga
and karma all have to come in the end to the Supreme Lord because

thing. That is the perfection of all sacrifice.

TRANSLATION
At that very moment a shudder suddenly ran through the heart of Diti,
the mother of Hiranyiksa. She recalled the words of her husband, Kasyapa,
and blood flowed from her breasts.
PURPORT
At Hiranyiaksa’s last moment, his mother, Diti, remembered what her
husband had said. Although her sons would be demons, they would have
the advantage of being killed by the Personality of Godhead Himself. She
remembered this incident by the grace of the Lord, and her breasts flowed
blood instead of milk. In many instances we find that when a mother is
moved by affection for her sons, milk flows from her breasts. In the case
of the demon’s mother, the blood could not transform into milk, but it
flowed down her breasts as it was. Blood transforms into milk. To drink
milk is auspicious, but to drink blood is inauspicious, although they are
one and the same thing. This formula is applicable in the case of cow's

vinastasu—when dispelled; sva-mayasu—his magic forces; bhiiyah—again;
ca—and; avrajya—after coming into the presence; kesavam—the Supreme
Personality of Godhead; rusa—full of rage; upaguhamanah—embracing;
amum—the Lord; dadrse—saw; avasthitam—standing; bahih—outside.

TRANSLATION

When the demon saw his magic forces dispelled, he once again came
into the presence of the Personality of Godhead, Kesava, and, full of rage,
tried to embrace Him within his arms to crush Him. But to his great
amazement he found the Lord standing outside the circle of his arms.

PURPORT

In this verse the Lord is addressed as Kesava because He killed the
demon 1৫681 in the beginning of creation. Kesava is also a name of Krsna.
Krsna is the origin of all incarnations, and it is confirmed in Brahma-
samhita that Govinda, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of
all causes, exists simultaneously in His different incarnations and expan-
sions. The demon’s attempt to measure the Supreme Personality of God-
head is significant. The demon wanted to embrace Him with his arms,
thinking that with his limited arms he could capture the Absolute by
material power. He did not know that God is the greatest of the great and
the smallest of the small. No one can capture the Supreme Lord nor bring
Him under his control. But the demoniac person always attempts lo
measure the length and breadth of the Supreme Lord. By His incon-
ceivable potency the lord can become the universal form, as explained in
Bhagavad-gita, and at the same time He can remain within the box of His
devotees as their worshipable Deity. There are many devotees who keep
a statue of the Lord in a small box and carry it with them everywhere;
every morning they worship the Lord in the box. The Supreme Lord,
Kesava, or the Personality of Godhead, Krsna, is not bound by any
measurement of our calculation. He can remain with His devotee in any
suitable form, yet He is unapproachable by any amount of demoniac
activities.

Though struck indifferently by the Lord, the conquerer of all, the
demon’s body began to wheel. His eyeballs bulged out of their sockets.
His arms and legs broken and the hair on his head scattered, he fell down
dead, like a gigantic tree uprooted by the wind.
PURPORT
It does not take even a moment for the Lord to kill any powerful
demon, including Hiranyiksa. He could have killed him long before, but
He allowed him to display the full extent of his magical feats. One may
know that by magical feats, by scientific advancement of knowledge or by
material power one cannot become the equal of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. His one signal is sufficient to destroy all our attempts. His
inconceivable power, as displayed here, is so strong that the demon,
despite all his demoniac maneuvers, was killed by the Lord when the Lord
desired, simply by one slap.

Text 28 The Killing of the Demon Hiranyaksa 741
TRANSLATION
Aja [Brahma] and others arrived on the spot to see the fearfully tusked
demon lying on the ground. Biting his lip, the glow of his face was yet
unfaded, and Brahma admiringly said: ®, who could meet such blessed
death?
PURPORT
Although the demon was dead, his bodily luster was unfaded. This is
very peculiar because when a man or animal is dead, the body immediately
becomes pale, the luster gradually fades, and decomposition takes place.
But here, although Hiranyaksa lay dead, his bodily luster was unfaded
because the Lord, the Supreme Spirit, was touching his body. One’s
bodily luster remains fresh only as long as the spirit soul is present.
Although the demon’s soul had departed his body, the Supreme Spirit
touched the body, and therefore his bodily luster did not fade. The
individual soul is different from the Supreme Personality of God-
head. One who sces the Supreme Personality of Godhead when he
quits his body is certainly very fortunate, and therefore personali-
ties like Brahma and the other demigods eulogized the death of the
demon.

TRANSLATION

Brahma continued: He was struck by a forefoot of the Lord, whom
yogis, seeking freedom from their unreal material bodies, meditate upon
in seclusion in mystic trance. While gazing on His countenance, this crest
jewel of Diti’s sons has cast off his mortal coil.
PURPORT
The process of yoga is very clearly described in this verse of Srimad-
Bhagavatam. 11 is said here that the ultimate end of the yogis and mystics
who perform meditation is to get rid of this material body. Therefore they
meditate in secluded places to attain yogic trance. Yoga has to be per-
formed in a secluded place, not in public or in a demonstration on stage, as
nowadays practiced by many so-called yogis. Real yoga aims at ridding one
of the material body. Yoga practice is not intended to keep the body fit
and young. Such advertisements of so-called yoga are not approved by any
standard method. Particularly mentioned in this verse is the word yam, or
“unto whom,” indicating that meditation should be targeted on the Person-
ality of Godhead. Even if one concentrates hismind on the boar form of the
Lord, that is also yoga. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita, one who concen-
trates his mind constantly in meditation upon the Personality of Godhead
in one of His many varieties of forms is the first-class yogi, and he can
very easily attain trance simply by meditating upon the form of the Lord.
If one is able to continue such meditation on the Lord’s form at the time
of his death, he is liberated from this mortal body and is transferred to the
kingdom of God. This opportunity was given to the demon by the Lord,
and therefore Brahma and other demigods were astonished. In other
words, the perfection of yoga practice can be attained by a demon also if
he is simply kicked by the Lord.

The demigods addressed the Lord: All obeisances unto You! You are
the enjoyer of all sacrifices, and You have assumed the form of a boar, in
pure goodness, for the purpose of maintaining the world. Fortunately for
us, this demon, who was a torment to the worlds, has been slain by You,
and we too, 0 Lord, are now at ease, in devotion to Your lotus feet.


--- Page 68 ---
744 $rimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 19
PURPORT

The material world consists of three modes—goodness, passion and
ignorance—but the spiritual world is pure goodness. It is said here that the
form of the Lord is pure goodness, which means that it is not material.
In the material world there is no pure goodness. In the Bhagavatam the
stage of pure goodness is called sattvam visuddham. Visuddham means
pure. In pure goodness there is no contamination by thé two inferior
qualities, namely passion and ignorance. The form of the boar, therefore,
in which the Lord appeared, is nothing of the material world. There are
many other forms of the Lord, but none of them belong to the material
qualities. Such forms are nondifferent from the Visnu form, and Visnu is
the enjoyer of all sacrifices.

The sacrifices which are recommended in the Vedas are meant to please
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In ignorance only, people try to
satisfy many other agents, but the real purpose of life is to satisfy the
Supreme Lord, Vignu. All sacrifices are meant to please the Supreme
Lord. The living entities who know this perfectly well are called demigods,
godly or almost God. Since the living entity is part and parcel of the
Supreme Lord, it is his duty to serve the Lord and please Him. The demi-
gods are all attached to the Personality of Godhead, and for their pleasure
the demon, who was a source of trouble to the world, was killed. Purified
life is meant to please the Lord, and all sacrifices performed in purified
life are called Krsna consciousness. This Krsna consciousness is developed
by devotional service, as clearly mentioned here.

TRANSLATION

Sri Maitreya continued: After thus killing the most formidable demon
Hiranyaksa, the Supreme Lord Hari, the origin of the boar species, returned
to His own abode, where there is always an uninterrupted festival. The
Lord was praised by all the demigods, headed by Brahma.

PURPORT

The Lord is spoken of herewith as the origin of the boar species. As
stated in the Vedanta-sitra (1.1.2), the Absolute Truth is the origin of
everything. Therefore it is to be understood that all 8,400,000 species of
bodily forms originate from the Lord, who is always adi, or the beginning.
In Bhagavad-gita Arjuna addresses the Lord as ddyam, or the original.
Similarly, in the Brahma-sarhita the Lord is addressed as adi-purusam, the
original person. Indeed, in Bhagavad-gita the Lord Himself declares, mattah
sarvam pravartate: “From Me everything proceeds.” (Bg. 10.8)

In this situation the Lord assumed the shape of a boar to kill the demon
Hiranyaksa and pick up the earth from the Garbha Ocean. Thus He became
adi-siikara, the original boar. In the material world a boar or pig is con-
sidered most abominable, but the adi-sikara, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, was not treated as an ordinary boar. Even Lord Brahma and the
other demigods praised the Lord’s form as a boar.

This verse confirms the statement in Bhagavad-gita that the Lord appears
as He is from His transcendental abode for the sake of killing the miscreants
and saving the devotees. By killing the demon Hiranyaksa He fulfilled His
promise to kill the demons and always protect the demigods headed by
Brahma. The statement that the Lord returned to His own abode indicates
that He has His own particular transcendental residence. Since He is full of
all energies, He is all-pervasive in spite of His residing in Goloka Vendavana,
just as the sun, although situated in a particular place within the universe,
is present by its sunshine throughout the universe.

Although the Lord has His particular abode in which to reside, He is
all-pervasive. The impersonalists accept one aspect of the Lord’s features,


--- Page 70 ---
746 $rimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 19
the all-pervasive aspect, but they cannot understand His localized situation
in His transcendental abode, where He always engages in fully tran-
scendental pastimes. Especially mentioned in this verse is the word
akhapditotsavam. Ulsava means pleasure. Whenever some function takes
place to express happiness, it is called utsava. Utsava, the expression of
complete happiness, is always present in the Vaikunthalokas, the abode of
the Lord, who is worshipable even by demigods like Brahma, to say noth-
ing of other less important entities such as human beings.

The Lord descends from His abode to this world, and therefore He is
called avatara, which means “one who descends.” Sometimes avaldra is
understood to refer to an incarnation who assumes a material form of
flesh and bone, but actually avatara refers to one who descends from
higher regions. The Lord’s abode is situated far above this material sky,
and He descends from that higher position; thus He is called avatara.

killing in a great fight a demon of unprecedented prowess as if he were


--- Page 71 ---
Text 33] The Killing of the Demon Hiranyaksa 747
just a plaything. This has been narrated by me as I heard it from my
predecessor spiritual master.

PURPORT

Here the sage Maitreya admits that he explained the incident of the
killing of Hiranyaksa by the Supreme Personality of Godhead as a straight
narration; he did not manufacture anything or add interpretation, but
explained whatever he had heard from his spiritual master. Thus he ac-
cepted as bona fide the system of parampara, or receiving the transcenden-
tal message in disciplic succession. Unless received by this bona fide
process of hearing from a spiritual master, the statement of an acarya or
preceptor cannot be valid.

It is also stated here that although the demon Hiranyaksa was unlimited
in prowess, he was just like a doll for the Lord. A child breaks so many
dolls without real endeavor. Similarly, although a demon may be very
powerful and extraordinary in the eyes of an ordinary man in the
material world, to the Lord, killing such a demon is no difficulty. He can
kill millions of demons as simply as a child plays with dolls and breaks
them.

--- Page 72 ---
748 $rimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 19
narration of the pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead from
the authoritative source of the sage Kausarava [Maitreya], and he was very
pleased.

PURPORT

If anyone wants to derive transcendental pleasure by hearing the pas-
times of the Lord, he must hear from the authoritative source, as explained
here. Maitreya heard the narration from his bona fide spiritual master, and
Vidura also heard from Maitreya. One becomes an authority simply by
presenting whatever he has heard from his spiritual master, and one who
does not accept a bona fide spiritual master cannot be an authority. This
is clearly explained here. If one wants to have transcendental pleasure, he
must find a person with authority. It is also stated in the Bhagavatam that
simply by hearing from an authoritative source, with the ear and the
heart, one can relish the pastimes of the Lord, otherwise it is not possible.
Sanatana Gosvami, therefore, has especially warned that one should not
hear anything about the personality of the Lord from the lips of a non-
devotee. Nondevotees are considered to be like serpents; as milk is poisoned
by a serpent’s touch, so, although the narration of the pastimes of the Lord
is as pure as milk, when administered by serpentlike nondevotees it
becomes poisonous. Not only does it have no effect in transcendental
pleasure, but it is dangerous also. Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu has warned
that no description of the pastimes of the Lord should be heard from the
Mayavada or impersonalist school. He has clearly said, mayavadi-bhasya:
If anyone hears the Mayavadis’ interpretation of the pastimes of the Lord,
or their interpretation of Bhagavad-gita, Srimad-Bhagavatam or any other
Vedic literature, then he is doomed. Once one is associated with imperson-
alists, he can never understand the personal feature of the l.ord and His
transcendental pastimes.

Saita Gosvami was speaking to the sages headed by Saunaka, and there-
fore he addressed them in this verse as dvija, twice-born. The sages
assembled in Naimigaranya hearing Srimad-Bhagavatam from StitaGosvami
were all brahmanas, but to acquire the qualifications of a brahmana is not
everything. Merely to be twice-born is not perfection. Perfection is attained
when one hears the pastimes and activities of the Lord from a bona fide
source.

What to speak of hearing the pastimes of the Lord, whose chest is

PURPORT
Bhagavatam literally means the pastimes of the Lord and the Lord’s
devotees. For example, there are pastimes of Lord Krsna and narrations of
devotees like Prahlada, Dhruva and Maharaja Ambarisa. Both pastimes
pertain to the Supreme Personality of Godhead because the devotees’
pastimes are in relation with Him. The Mahabharata, for example, the
history of the Pandavas and their activities, is sacred because the
Pandavas had a direct relationship with the Supreme Personality of
Godhead.

The example of the elephant in danger who was saved by the Supreme
Lord is especially cited here because even if one is an animal he can

conscious and offer devotional service to the Lord. Those who are actual-
ly thieves and rogues do not recognize or acknowledge the benedictions

how much benefit they are deriving by the arrangement of the Lord.
They enjoy the sunshine and moonshine, and they get water free of
charge, yet they do not feel grateful, but simply go on enjoying these
gifts of the Lord. Therefore, they must be called thieves and rogues.

about the pastimes of the Lord associates with the Lord directly, and one
who associates directly with the Lord is certainly freed from all sinful
activities, even to the extent of the killing of a brahmana, which is con-

752 $rimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 19
sidered the most sinful activity in the material world. One should be very
eager to hear about the activities of the Lord from the bona fide source, the
pure devotee. If one simply gives aural reception to the narration and
accepts the glories of the Lord, then he is qualified. The impersonalist
philosophers cannot understand the activities of the Lord. They think that
all His activities are maya; therefore they are called Mayavadis. Since
everything to them is maya, these narrations are not for them. Some
impersonalists are reluctant to hear Srimad-Bhagavatam, although many of
them are now taking an interest in it just for monetary gain. Actually,
however, they have no faith. On the contrary, they describe it in their
own way. We should not hear, therefore, from the Mayavadis. We have to
hear from Sita Gosvami or Maitreya, who actually present the narrations
as they are, and only then can we relish the pastimes of the Lord, otherwise
the effects on the neophyte audience will be poisonous.

who listens to it at the last moment of his life is transferred to the supreme
abode of the Lord, O dear Saunaka.
PURPORT

Devotees are generally attracted by the narratives of the pastimes of the
Lord, and even though they do not prosecute austerities or meditation,
this very process of hearing attentively about the pastimes of the Lord
will endow them with innumerable benefits, such as wealth, fame, longevity
and other desirable aims of life. If one continues to hear Srimad-
Bhagavatam, which is full of narratives of the pastimes of the Lord, at the
end of this life one is sure to be transferred to the eternal transcendental
abode of the Lord. Thus hearers are benefited both ultimately and for as
long as they are in the material world. That is the supreme sublime result
of engaging in devotional service. The beginning of devotional service is to
spare some time and listen to Srimad-Bhagavatam from the right source.
Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu also recommended five items of devotional
service, namely to serve the devotees of the Lord, to chant Hare Krsna, to
hear Srimad-Bhagavatam, to worship the Deity of the Lord and to live in a
place of pilgrimage. Just performing these five activities can deliver one
from the miserable condition of material life.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Nineteenth Chapter, Third
Canto, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “The Killing of the Demon
Hiranyaksa.”

TRANSLATION
Sri Saunaka inquired: 0 Sata Gosvami, after the earth was again
situated in its orbit, what did Svayambhuva Manu do to show the path of
liberation to persons who were to take birth later on?
PURPORT
The appearance of the Lord as the first boar incarnation occurred dur-
ing the time of Svayambhuva Manu, whereas the present age isin the period
of Vaivasvata Manu. Each Manu’s period lasts seventy-two times the cycle
of four ages, and one cycle of ages equals 4,320,000 solar years. Thus
4,320,000 times 72 solar years is the reign of one Manu. In each Manu’s
period there are many changes in many ways, and there are fourteen Manus

within one day of Brahma. It is understood here that Manu creates
scriptural regulations for the salvation of the conditioned souls who come
to the material world for material enjoyment. The Lord is so kind that any
soul who wants to enjoy in this material world is given full facility for
enjoyment, and at the same time he is shown the path of salvation.
Saunaka Rsi, therefore, inquired from Sata Gosvami: “What did
Svayambhuva Manu do after the reinstatement of the earth in its
orbital situation?”

TRANSLATION
He inquired about Vidura, who was a great devotee and friend of Lord
Krsna’s and who gave up the company of his elder brother because the
latter, along with his sons, played tricks against the desires of the Lord.
PURPORT
The incident referred to here is that Vidura left the protection of his
elder brother Dhrtarasira, went traveling everywhere to sacred places and
met Maitreya at Hardwar. Saunaka Rsi here inquires about the topics of
the conversation between Maitreya Rsi and Vidura. Vidura’s qualification
was that he was not only a friend of the Lord’s but also a great devotee.
When Krsna tried to stop the war and mitigate the misunderstanding
between the cousin-brothers, they refused to accept His counsel; therefore
Ksatta, or Vidura, was unsatisfied with them, and he left the palace. As a
devotee, Vidura showed by example that anywhere that Krsna is not

Text 4] Conversation Between Maitreya and Vidura 757
honored is a place unfit for human habitation. A devotee may be tolerant
regarding his own interests, but he should not be tolerant when there is
misbehavior towards the Lord or the Lords devotee. Here the word
aghavan is very significant, for it indicates that the Kauravas, Dhrtarasira’s
sons, lost the war because of being sinful in disobeying the instructions of
Krsna.

Vidura was born from the body of Vedavyasa, and he was not less than
him. Thus he accepted the lotus feet of Krsna wholeheartedly and was
attached to His devotees.
PURPORT
The history of Vidura is that he was born of a 80070 mother, but his
seminal father was Vyasadeva; thus he was not less than Vyasadeva in any
respect. Since he was born of a great father, who was supposed to be an
incarnation of Narayana and who composed all the Vedic literatures,
Vidura was also a greal personality. He accepted Krsna as his worshipable
Lord and followed His instructions wholeheartedly.

kim—what; anvaprcchat—inquired; maitreyam—from the sage Maitreya;
virajah— Vidura, who was without material contamination; tirtha-sevaya—
by visiting sacred places; upagamya—having met; kusavarte—at Kusavarta
(Haridvara or Hardwar); @sinam—who was abiding; tattva-vittamam—the
foremost knower of the science of spiritual life.

TRANSLATION

Vidura was purified of all passion by wandering in sacred places, and at
last he reached Hardwar, where he met the great sage, who knew the
science of spiritual life, and he inquired from him. Saunaka Rsi therefore
asked: What more did Vidura inquire from Maitreya?

PURPORT

Here the words virajas tirtha-sevaya refer to Vidura, who was completely
cleansed of all contamination by traveling in places of pilgrimage. In India
there are hundreds of sacred places of pilgrimage, of which Praydga,
Hardwar, Vrndavana and Rameshwaram are considered principal. After
leaving his home, which was full of politics and diplomacy, Vidura wanted
to purify himself by traveling to all the sacred places, which are so
situated that anyone who goes there automatically becomes purified. This
is especially true in Vrndavana; any person may go there, and even if he is
sinful he will at once contact an atmosphere of spiritual life and will

"automatically chant the names of Krsna and Radha. That we have actually
seen and experienced. It is recommended in the sastras that after retiring
from active life and accepting the vanaprastha (retired) order, one should
travel everywhere to places of pilgrimage in order to purify himself.
Vidura completely discharged this duty, and at last he reached Kusavarta,
or Hardwar, where the sage Maitreya was sitting.

Another significant point is that one must go to sacred places not only
to take bath there, but to search out great sages like Maitreya and take
instructions from them. If one does not do so, his traveling to places of
pilgrimage is simply a waste of time. Narotlama dasa Thakura, a great
acarya of the Vaignava sect, has, for the present, forbidden us to go to such
places of pilgrimage because in this age, the times having so changed, a


--- Page 82 ---
Text 5] Conversation Between Maitreya and Vidura 759
sincere person may have a different impression on seeing the behavior of
the present residents of the pilgrimage sites. He has recommended that
instead of taking the trouble to travel to such places, one should
concentrate his mind on Govinda, and that will help him. Of course, to
concentrate one’s mind on Govinda in any place is a path meant for those
who are the most spiritually advanced; it is not for ordinary persons.
Ordinary persons may still derive benefit from traveling to holy places like
Prayaga, Mathura, Vyndavana and Hardwar.

Tt is recommended in this verse that one find a person who knows the
science of God, or a tattva-vit. Tattva-vit means one who knows the Abso-
lute Truth. There are many pseudo-transcendentalists, cven at places of
pilgrimage. Such men are always present, and one has to be intelligent
enough to find the actual person to be consulted; then his attempt to
progress by traveling to different holy places will be successful. One has to
be freed from all contamination, and at the same time he has to find a
person who knows the science of Krsna. Krsna helps a sincere person; as
stated in the Caitanya-caritamrta, guru-krsna-prasade: by the mercy of the
spiritual master and Krsna, one attains the path of salvation, devotional
service. If one sincerely searches for spiritual salvation, then Krsna, being
situated in everyone’s heart, gives him the intelligence to find a suitable
spiritual master. By the grace of a spiritual master like Maitreya, one gets
the proper instruction and advances in his spiritual life.

TRANSLATION
Saunaka inquired about the conversation between Vidura and Maitreya:
There must have been many narrations of the spotless pastimes of the
Lord. The hearing of such narrations is exactly like bathing in the water of
the Ganges, for it can free one from all sinful reactions.
PURPORT
The water of the Ganges is purified because it pours forth from the lotus
feet of the Lord. Similarly, Bhagavad-gita is as good as the water of the
Ganges because it is spoken from the mouth of the Supreme Lord. So it is
with any topic on Lhe pastimes of the Lord or the characteristics of His
transcendental activities. The Lord is absolute; there is no difference
between His words, His perspiration or His pastimes. The water of the
Ganges, the narrations of His pastimes and the words spoken by Him are
all on the absolute platform, and thus taking shelter of any one of them is
equally good. Srila Rupa Gosvami has enunciated that anything in relation-
ship with Krsna is on the transcendental platform. If we can dovetail all
our activities in relationship with Krsna, then we do not stand on the
material platform, but always on the spiritual platform.

Text 8] Conversation Between Maitreya and Vidura 761
PURPORT
The narration of the pastimes of the Lord, which are always enacted on
the transcendental platform, should be received with all respect by devotees.
Those who are actually on the transcendental platform are never satiated
by hearing the continuous narration of the pastimes of the Lord. For
example, if any self-realized soul reads from Bhagavad-gita, he will never
feel satiated. The narrations of Bhagavad-gita or & mad Bhagavatam may
be read thousands and thousands of times, and still, without fail, new
aspects of the subject matter will be relished by the devotee.

Siita Gosvami continued: Vidura, the descendant of Bharata, was
delighted to hear the story of the Lord, who, having assumed by His own
divine potency the form of a boar, had enacted the sport of lifting the
earth from the bottom of the ocean and indifferently killing the demon
Hiranyiksa. He then spoke to the sage as follows.
PURPORT
It is stated here that the Lord assumed the form of a boar by His own
potency. His form is not actually the form of a conditioned soul. A
conditioned soul is forced to accept a particular type of body by the
higher authority of material laws, but here it is clearly said that the Lord
was not forced to accept the form of a boar by the external power. In
Bhagavad-gita the same fact is confirmed; when the Lord descends to this
earth, He assumes a form by His own internal potency. The form of the
Lord, therefore, can never consist of material energy. The Mayavada version
that when Brahman assumes a form the form is accepted from maya is not
acceptable because although maya is superior to the conditioned soul, she
is not superior to the Supreme Personality of Godhead; she is under the
control of the Supreme Godhead, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita. Maya is
under His superintendence; maya cannot overcome the Lord. The Mayavada
idea that the living entity is the Supreme Absolute Truth but has become
covered by maya is invalid because maya cannot be so great that it can
cover the Supreme. The covering capacity can be employed on the part
and parcel of Brahman, not on the Supreme Brahman.

TRANSLATION
Vidura said: Since you know of matters inconceivable to us, tell me, O
holy sage, what did Brahma do to create living beings after evolving the
prajapatis, the progenitors of living beings?
PURPORT
Significant here is the word avyakta-marga-vit, one who knows that
which is beyond our perception. To know matters beyond one’s perception,
one has to learn from a superior authority in the line of disciplic succession.
Just to know who is our father is beyond our perception. For that, the
mother is the authority. Similarly, we have to understand everything
beyond our perception from the authority who actually knows. The first
avyakta-marga-vit, or authority, is Brahma, and the next authority in
disciplic succession is Narada. Maitreya Rsi belonged to that disciplic suc-
cession, so he also is avyakla-marga-vit. Anyone in the bona fide line of
disciplic succession is avyakta-marga-vit, a personality who knows that
which is beyond ordinary perception.

TRANSLATION

Maitreya said: When the equilibrium of the combination of the three
modes of nature was agitated by the unseen activity of the living entity,
by Maha-Visnu, and by the force of time, the total material elements were
produced.

PURPORT

The cause of the material creation is described here very lucidly. The
first cause is daiva, or the destiny of the conditioned soul. The material
creation exists for the conditioned soul who wanted to become a false lord
for sense enjoyment. One cannot trace out the history of when the condi-
tioned soul first desired to lord it over material nature, but in Vedic
literature we always find that the material creation is meant for the sense
enjoyment of the conditioned soul. There is a nice verse which says that the
sum and substance of the conditioned soul’s sense enjoyment is that as
soon as he forgets his primary duty, to render service to the Lord, he
creates an atmosphere of sense enjoyment which is called maya; that is the
cause of material creation.

Another word used here is durvitarkyena. No one can argue about when
and how the conditioned soul became desirous of sense enjoyment, but the
cause is there. Material nature is an atmosphere meant only for the sense
enjoyment of the conditioned soul, and it is created by the Personality of
Godhead. It is mentioned here that in the beginning of creation the material
nature, or prakrti, is agitated by the Personality of Godhead, 12111. There
are three Visnus mentioned. One is Maha-Vignu, another 15 Garbhodakasayt
Visnu, and the third is Ksirodakasayi Visnu. The First Canto of Srimad-
Bhagavatam discusses all these three Visnus, and here also it is confirmed


--- Page 89 ---
766 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 20
that Visnu is the cause of creation. From Bhagavad-gita also we learn that
prakrti begins to work and is still working under Krsna’s or Visnu’s glance
of superintendence, but the Supreme Personality of Godhead is unchange-
able. One should not misunderstand that because the creation emanates
from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He has therefore transformed
into this material cosmic manifestation. He exists in His personal form
always, but the cosmic manifestation takes place by His inconceivable
potency. The workings of that energy are difficult to comprehend, but it is
understood from Vedic literature that the conditioned soul creates his own
destiny and is offered a particular body by the laws of nature under the
superintendence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who always
accompanies him as Paramatma.

As impelled by the destiny of the jiva, the false ego, which is of three

PURPORT
The primordial matter or prakrti, material nature, consisting of three
modes, generates four groups of five. The first group is called elementary
and consists of earth, water, fire, air and ether. The second group of five
is called tanmatra, referring to the subtle elements (sense objects): sound,

touch, form, taste, and smell. The third group is the five sense organs for
acquiring knowledge: eyes, ears, nose, tongue and skin. The fourth group
is the five working senses: speech, hands, feet, anus and genitals. Some say
that there are five groups of five. One group is the sense objects, one is the
five elements, one is the five sense organs for acquiring knowledge, another
is the senses for working, and the fifth group is the five deities who control
these divisions.

From the navel of the Personality of Godhead, Garbhodakasayi Visnu,
sprouted a lotus flower effulgent like a thousand blazing suns. This
lotus flower is the reservoir of all conditioned souls, and the first living
entity who came out of the lotus flower was the omnipotent Brahma.
PURPORT
It appears from this verse that the conditioned souls who rested within
the body of the Personality of Godhead after the dissolution of the last
creation came out in the sum total form of the lotus. This is called
hirapyagarbha. The first living entity to come out was Lord Brahma, who


--- Page 92 ---
Text 17] Conversation Between Maitreya and Vidura 769
is independently able to create the rest of the manifested universe. The
lotus is described here to be as effulgent as the glare of a thousand suns.
This indicates that the living entities, as parts and parcels of the Supreme
Lord, are also of the same quality, since the Lord also diffuses His bodily
glare, known as brahmajyoti. The description of Vaikunthaloka, as stated
in Bhagavad-gita and other Vedic literatures, is confirmed herewith. In
Vaikuntha, the spiritual sky, there is no need of sunshine, moonshine,
electricity or fire. Every planet there is self-effulgent like the sun.

When that Supreme Personality of Godhead who is lying on the

PURPORT
At a certain time, the Personality of Godhead, Karanodakasay1 Visnu,
lies in the Karana Ocean and produces many thousands of universes from
His breathing; then He enters again into each and every universe as
Garbhodakasayi Visnu and fills up half of each universe with His own
perspiration. The other half of the universe remains vacant, and that vacant
region is called outer space. Then the lotus flower sprouts from His
abdomen and produces the first living creature, Brahma. Then again, as
Ksirodakasayi Visnu, the Lord enters into the heart of every living entity,


--- Page 93 ---
770 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 20
including Brahma. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita, Fifteenth Chapter.
The Lord says, “I am seated in everyone’s heart, and by Me are remem-
brance and forgetfulness made possible.” As the witness of the activities of
the individual entities, the Lord gives each one remembrance and intelli-
gence to act according to his desire at the time he was annihilated in his
last birth in the last millennium. This intelligence is invoked according to
one’s own capacity, or by the law of karma.

Brahma was the first living entity, and he was empowered by the
Supreme Lord to act in charge of the mode of passion; therefore, he was
given the required intelligence, which is so powerful and extensive that he
is almost independent of the control of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Just as a highly posted manager is almost as independent as the
owner of a firm, so Brahma is described here as independent because, as
the Lord’s representative to control the universe, he is almost as powerful
and independent as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord, as
the Supersoul within Brahma, gave him the intelligence to create. The
creative power, therefore, of every living entity is not his own; it is by the
grace of the Lord that one can create. There are many scientists and
great workers in this material world who have wonderful creative force,
but they act and create only according to the direction of the Supreme
Lord. A scientist may create many wonderful inventions by the direction
of the Lord, but it is not possible for him to overcome the stringent laws
of material nature by his intelligence, nor is it possible to acquire such
intelligence from the Lord because the Lord’s supremacy would then be
hampered. It is stated in this verse that Brahma created the universe as it
was before. This means that he created everything by the same name and
form as in the previous cosmic manifestation.

TRANSLATION

First of all, Brahma created from his shadow the coverings of ignorance
of the conditioned souls. They are five in number and are called tamisra,
andha-tamisra, tamas, moha and mahamoha.

PURPORT

The conditioned souls, or living entities who come to the material world
to enjoy sense gratification, are covered in the beginning by five different
conditions. The first condition is a covering of tamisra, or anger.
Constitutionally, each and every living entity has minute independence; it
is misuse of that minute independence for the conditioned soul to think
that he can also enjoy like the Supreme Lord or to think, “Why shall I not
be a free enjoyer like the Supreme Lord?” This forgetfulness of his
constitutional position is due to anger or envy. The living entity, being
eternally a part and parcel servitor of the Supreme Lord, can never, by
constitution, be an equal enjoyer with the Lord. When he forgets this,
however, and tries to be one with Him, this condition is called tamisra.
Even in the field of spiritual realization, this tamisra mentality of the living
entity is hard to overcome. In trying to get out of the entanglement of
material life, there are many who want to be one with the Supreme. Even
in their transcendental activities, this lower grade mentality of tamisra
continues.

Andha-tamisra involves considering death to be the ultimate end. The
atheists generally think that the body is the self and that everything is
therefore ended with the end of the body. Thus they want to enjoy ma-
terial life as far. as possible during the existence of the body. Their theory
is: “As long as you live, you should live prosperously. Never mind whether
you commit all kinds of so-called sins. You must eat sumptuously. Beg,
borrow and steal, and if you think that by stealing and borrowing you are
being entangled in sinful activities for which you will have to pay, then
just forget that misconception because after death everything is finished.
No one is responsible for anything he does during his life.” This atheistic
conception of life is killing human civilization, for it is without knowledge
of the continuation of eternal life.

This andha-tamisra ignorance is due to tamas. The condition of not know-
ing anything about the spirit soul is called tamas. This material world is also
generally called tamas because 99% of its living entities are ignorant of


--- Page 95 ---
772 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 20
their identity as soul. Almost everyone is thinking that he is this body; he
has no information of the spirit soul. Guided by this misconception, one
always thinks, “This is my body, and anything in relationship with this
body is mine.” For such misguided living entities, sex life is the background
of material existence. Actually, the conditioned souls, in ignorance in this
material world, are simply guided by sex life, and as soon as they get the
opportunity for sex life, they become attached to so-called home, mother-
land, children, wealth and opulence. As these attachments increase, so
moha, or the illusion of the bodily concept of life, also increases. Thus
the idea that “1 am this body, and everything belonging to this body is
mine” also increases, and as the whole world is put into moha, sectarian
societies, families and nationalities are created, and they fight with one
another. Mahamoha means to be mad after material enjoyment. Especially
in this age of Kali, everyone is overwhelmed by the madness to accumulate
paraphernalia for material enjoyment. These definitions are very nicely
given in Visnu Purana, wherein it is said:
tamo 'viveko mohah syad antah-karana-vibhramah

The representatives of the Y aksas and Raksgasas still exist in some coun-

in killing their own grandfathers and holding a “love feast” by roasting
the bodies.

Brahma, the head of the demigods, full of anxiety, asked them, “Do
not eat me, but protect me. You are born from me and have become my
sons. Therefore you are Yaksas and Rakgasas.”
PURPORT
The demons who were born from the body of Brahma were called
Yaksas and Raksasas because some of them cried that Brahma should be
eaten and the others cried that he should not be protected. The ones who
said that he should be eaten were called Y aksas, and the ones who said
that he should not be protected became Raksasas, man-eaters. The two,
Yaksas and Raksasas, are the original creation by Brahma and are represented
even until today in the uncivilized men who are scattered all over the
universe. They are born of the mode of ignorance, and therefore, because
of their behavior, they are called Raksasas, or man-eaters.

PURPORT
Demons were born from the creation of night, and the demigods were
born from the creation of day. In other words, demons like the Yakgas
and Raksasas are born of the quality of ignorance, and demigods are born
of the quality of goodness.

Lord Brahma then gave birth to the demons from the backside of his
body, and they were very fond of sex. Because they were too lustful,
they approached him for copulation.
PURPORT
Sex life is the background of material existence. Here also it is repeated
that demons are very fond of sex life. The more one is free from the desires
for sex, the more he is promoted to the level of the demigods; the
more one is inclined to enjoy sex, the more he is degraded to the level of
demoniac life.

Sexually inclined demons have no respect even for their father, and the

Text 25] Conversation Between Maitreya and Vidura 777
PURPORT

Here the words bhaktanam anurapatma-darsanam mean that the
Personality of Godhead manifests His multi-forms according to the desires
of the devotees. For example, Hanumanji (Vajrangaji) wanted to see the
form of the Lord as the Personality of Godhead Ramacandra, whereas
other Vaispavas want to see the form of Radha-Krsna, and still other
devotees want to see the Lord in the form of Laksmi-Narayana. The
Mayavadi philosophers think that although all these forms are assumed by
the Lord just as the devotees desire to see Him, actually He is impersonal.
From Brahma-samhita, however, we can understand that this is not so, for
the Lord has multi-forms. It is said in the Brahma-samhita, advaitam
acyutam. The Lord does not appear before the devotee because of the
devotee’s imagination. Brahma-samhita further explains that the Lord has
innumerable forms: ramadi-miirtisu kald-niyamena tisthan. He exists in
millions and millions of forms. There are 8,400,000 species of living
entities, but the incarnations of the Supreme Lord are innumerable. In the
Bhagavatam it is stated that as the waves in the sea cannot be counted but
appear and disappear continually, so the incarnations and forms of the
Lord are innumerable. A devotee is attached to a particular form, and it is
that form which he worships. We have just described the first appearance
of the boar within this universe. There are innumerable universes, and
somewhere or other the boar form is now existing. All the forms of the
Lord are eternal. It is the devotees inclination to worship a particular
form, and he engages in devotional service to that form. In a verse in the
Ramayana, Hanuman, the great devotee of Rama, said, “I know that
there is no difference between the Sita-Rama and Laksmi-Narayana forms
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but nevertheless the form of
Rama and Sita has absorbed my affection and love. Therefore I want to
see the Lord in the forms of Rama and Sita.” Similarly, the Gaudiya
Vaisnava loves the forms of Radha and Krsna, and Krsna and Rukmini at
Dvaraka. The words bhaktdndm anuriipatma-darsanam mean that the Lord
is always pleased to favor the devotee in the particular form in which the
devotee wants to worship and render service unto Him. In this verse
it is stated that Brahma approached Hari, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. This form of the Lord is Ksirodakasayi Vispu. Whenever there
is some trouble and Brahma has to approach the Lord, he can approach
Ksirodakasayi Vispu, and it is the grace of the Lord that whenever Brahma
approaches about disturbances in the universe, the Lord gives him relief in
SO many ways.

come to attack me.
PURPORT
It appears here that the homosexual appetite of males for each other is
created in this episode of the creation of the demons by Brahma. In other
words, the homosexual appetite of a man for another man is demoniac
and is not for any sane male in the ordinary course of life.

PURPORT
The words klesadas tesam anasanna-padam tava indicate that the Lord
has two concerns. The first is to give protection to persons who take
shelter of His lotus feet, and the second is to give trouble to those who are
always demoniac and who are inimical towards the Lord. Maya's function
is to give afflictions to the nondevotees. Here Brahma said, “You are the
protector of the surrendered souls; therefore I surrender unto Your lotus
feet. Please give me protection from these demons.”

--- Page 103 ---
780 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 20
Lord Himself. If someone is in distress and wants to get relief from his
friend, sometimes it so happens that his friend does not appreciate the
volume of distress he is suffering. But for the Supreme Lord it is not
difficult. The Supreme Lord, as Paramatma, is sitting within the heart of
every living entity, and He directly perceives the exact causes of distress.
In Bhagavad-gita the Lord says, sarvasya ০৫/১৫7 hrdi sannivistah: "ना am
sitting in everyone’s heart, and because of Me one’s remembrance and
forgetfulness occur.” Thus whenever one fully surrenders unto the Su-
preme Lord, he finds that He is sitting within his heart. He can give us
direction how to get out of dangers or how to approach Him in devotional
service. The Lord, however, asked Brahma to give up his present body
because it had created the demoniac principle. According to Sridhara
Svami, Brahma’s constant dropping of his body does not refer to his
actually giving up his body. Rather, he suggests that Brahma gave up a
particular mentality. Mind is the subtle body of the living entity. We may
sometimes be absorbed in some thought which is sinful, but if we give up
the sinful thought, it may be said that we give up the body. Brahma’s
mind was not in correct order when he created the demons. It must have
been full of passion because the entire creation was passionate; therefore such
passionate sons were born. It follows that any father and mother should
also be careful while begetting children. The mental condition of a child
depends upon the mental status of his parents at the time he is conceived.
According to the Vedic system, therefore, the garbhadana-samskara, or the
ceremony for giving birth to a child, is observed. Before begetting a child,
one has to sanctify his perplexed mind. When the parents engage their
minds in the lotus feet of the Lord and in such a state the child is born,
naturally good devotee children come; when the society is full of such
good population, there is no trouble from demoniac mentalities.

TRANSLATION
The body given up by Brahma took the form of the evening twilight,
when the day and night meet, a time which kindles passion. The asuras,
who are passionate by nature, dominated as they are by the element of
rajas, took it for a damsel, whose lotus feet resounded with the tinkling of
anklets, whose eyes were wide with intoxication and whose hips were
covered by fine cloth, over which shone a girdle.
PURPORT
As early morning is the period for spiritual cultivation, so the beginning
of evening is the period for passion. Demoniac men are generally very fond
of sex enjoyment; therefore they very much appreciate the approach of
evening. The demons took the approach of the evening twilight to be a
beautiful woman, and they began to adore her in various ways. They
imagined the twilight to be a very beautiful woman with tinkling bangles
on her feet, a girdle on her hips, and beautiful breasts, and for their sexual
satisfaction they imagined the appearance of this beautiful girl before
them.

cast a sportful glance at the asuras.

TRANSLATION

Adorned with dark tresses, she hid herself, as it were, out of shyness.
Upon seeing that girl, the asuras were all infatuated with an appetite for
sex.

PURPORT

The difference between demons and demigods is that abeautiful woman
very easily attracts the minds of demons, but she cannot attract the mind
of a godly person. A godly person is full of knowledge, and a demoniac
person is full of ignorance. Just as a child is attracted by a beautiful doll,
similarly a demon, who is less intelligent and full of ignorance, is attracted
by material beauty and an appetite for sex. The godly person knows that
this nicely dressed and ornamented attraction of high breasts, high hips,
beautiful nose and fair complexion is maya. All the beauty a woman can
display is only a combination of flesh and blood. Sri Sankaracarya has
advised all persons not to be attracted by the interaction of flesh and
blood; they should be attracted by the real beauty in spiritual life. The
real beauty is Krsna and Radha. One who is attracted by the beauty of
Radha and Krsna cannot be attracted by the false beauty of this material
world. That is the difference between a demon and a godly person or
devotee.

PURPORT
The mentality of the demons in being enamored by the false beauty of
this material world is expressed herein. The demoniac can pay any price for
the skin beauty of this material world. They work very hard all day and
night, but the purpose of their hard work is to enjoy sex life. Sometimes
they misrepresent themselves as karma-yogis, not knowing the meaning of
the word yoga. Yoga means to link up with the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, or to act in Krsna consciousness. A person who works very hard,
no matter in what occupation, and who offers the result of the work to the
service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, is called a karma-
yogi.

TRANSLATION

Whosoever you may be, O beautiful girl, we are fortunate in being able to
see you. While playing with a ball, you have agitated the minds of all
onlookers.

PURPORT

Demons arrange many kinds of performances to see the glaring beauty
of a beautiful woman. Here it is stated that they saw the girl playing with
a ball. Sometimes the demoniac arrange for so-called sports, like tennis,
with the opposite sex. The purpose of such sporting is to see the bodily
construction of the beautiful girl and enjoy a subtle sex mentality. This
demoniac sex mentality of material enjoyment is sometimes encouraged
by so-called yogis who encourage the public to enjoy sex life in different
varieties and at the same time advertise that if one meditates on a certain
manufactured mantra one can become God within six months. The public
wants to be cheated, and Krsna therefore creates such cheaters to misrepre-
sent and delude. These so-called yogis are actually enjoyers of the world
garbed as yogis. Bhagavad-gita, however, recommends that if one wants to
enjoy life, then it cannot be with these gross senses. A patient is advised
by the experienced physician to refrain from ordinary enjoyment while in
the diseased condition. A diseased person cannot enjoy anything; he has to
restrain his enjoyment in order to get rid of the disease. Similarly, our
material condition is a diseased condition. If one wants to enjoy real sense
enjoyment, then one must get free of the entanglement of material exis-
tence. In spiritual life we can enjoy sense enjoyment which has no end.
The difference between material and spiritual enjoyment is that material
enjoyment is limited. Even if a man engages in material sex enjoyment, he
cannot enjoy it for long. But when the sex enjoyment is given up, then one
can enter spiritual life, which is unending. In the Bhagavatam it is stated
that brahma-saukhya, spiritual happiness, is ananta, unending. Foolish
creatures are enamored by the beauty of matter and think that the
enjoyment it offers is real, but actually that is not real enjoyment.

O beautiful woman, when you strike the bouncing ball against the
ground with your hand again and again, your lotus feet do not stay in one
place. Oppressed by the weight of your full-grown breasts, your waist
becomes fatigued, and your clear vision grows dull, as it were. Pray braid
your comely hair.
PURPORT 1
The demons observed beautiful gestures in the woman’s every step. Here
they praise her full-grown breasts, her scattered hair and her movements in
stepping forward and backward while playing with the ball. In every step
they enjoy her womanly beauty, and while they enjoy her beauty their
minds become agitated by sex desire. As moths at night surround a fire and
are killed, so the demons become victims of the movements of the ball-like
breasts of a beautiful woman. The scattered hair of a beautiful woman also
afflicts the heart of a lusty demon.

the false glaring beauty of this material form, and thus they embraced her.

With a laugh full of deep significance, the worshipful Brahma then

hosts of Gandharvas and Apsaras.
PURPORT
The musicians in the upper planetary systems are called Gandharvas,
and the dancing girls are called Apsaras. After being attacked by the
demons and evolving a form of a beautiful woman in the twilight, Brahma
next created Gandharvas and Apsaras. Music and dancing employed in
sense gratification are to be accepted as demoniac, but the same music and
dancing, when employed in glorifying the Supreme Lord as kirtana, is
transcendental and brings about a life completely fit for spiritual enjoy-
ment.

TRANSLATION

The ghosts and hobgoblins took possession of the body which was
thrown off in the form of yawning by Brahma, the creator of the living
entities. This is also known as the sleep which causes drooling. The hob-
goblins and ghosts attack men who are impure, and their attack is spoken
of as insanity.

PURPORT

The disease of insanity or being haunted by ghosts takes place in an
unclean state of existence. Here it is clearly stated that when a man is fast
asleep and saliva flows from his mouth and he remains unclean, ghosts then
take advantage of his unclean state and haunt his body. In other words,
those who drool while sleeping are considered unclean and are subject to
be haunted by ghosts or to go insane.

TRANSLATION
The Pitas themselves took possession of the invisible body, the source of
their existence. It is through the medium of this invisible body that those
well versed in the rituals offer oblations to the Sadhyas and Pitas [in the
form of their departed ancestors] on the occasion of sraddha.
PURPORT
Sraddha is a ritualistic performance observed by the followers of the
Vedas. There is a yearly occasion of fifteen days when ritualistic religion-
ists follow the principle of offering oblations to departed souls. Thus those
fathers and ancestors who, by freaks of nature, might not have a gross body
for material enjoyment, can again gain such bodies due to the offering of
sraddha oblations by their descendants. The performance of sraddha, or
offering oblations with prasada, is still current in India, especially at


--- Page 115 ---
792 $rimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 20
Gaya, where oblations are offered at the lotus feet of Visnu in a celebrated
temple. Because the Lord is thus pleased with the devotional service of
the descendants, by His grace he liberates the condemned souls of fore-
fathers who do not have gross bodies, and He favors them to again receive
a gross body for development of spiritual advancement. #

Unfortunately, by the influence of maya, the conditioned soul employs
the body he gets for sense gratification, forgetting that such an occupation
may lead him to return again to an invisible body. The devotee of the Lord,
or one who is in Krsna consciousness, however, does not need to perform
such ritualistic ceremonies as sraddha because he is always pleasing the
Supreme Lord; therefore his fathers and ancestors who might have been
in difficulty are automatically relieved. The vivid example is Prahlada
Maharaja. Prahlada Maharaja requested Lord Nrsimhadeva to deliver his
sinful father, who had so many times offended the lotus feet of the Lord.
The Lord replied that in a family where a Vaisnava like Prahlada is born,
not only his father but his father’s father and their fathers—up to the
fourteenth father back—are all automatically delivered. The conclusion,
therefore, is that Krsna consciousness is the sum total of all good work
for the family, for society and for all living entities. In the Caitanya-
caritamrta the author says that a person fully conversant with Krsna con-
sciousness does not perform any rituals because he knows that simply by
serving Krsna in full Krsna consciousness, all rituals are automatically
performed.

Text 52] Conversation Between Maitreya and Vidura 797
PURPORT
The importance of sacrifice is also mentioned in Bhagavad-gita, Third
Chapter, -tenth verse. The Lord confirms there that in the beginning of
creation Brahma created the Manus, along with the ritualistic sacrificial
method, and blessed them: “Continue these sacrificial rites, and you will be
gradually elevated to your proper position of self-realization and will also
enjoy material happiness.” All the living entities created by Brahma
are conditioned souls and are inclined to lord it over material nature.
The purpose of sacrificial rituals is to revive, gradually, the spiritual
realization of the living entities. That is the beginning of life within
this universe. These sacrificial rituals, however, are intended to please
the Supreme Lord. Unless one pleases the Supreme Lord or unless
one is Krsna conscious, one cannot be happy either in material enjoyment
or in spiritual realization.

condition for cultivation of spiritual knowledge. But for actual attainment
of spiritual knowledge, other qualifications are needed. What is essential is
vidya, or worship of the Supreme Lord. Sometimes the word yoga is used
to refer to the gymnastic performances of different bodily postures which
help mental concentration. Generally, the different bodily postures in the
yoga system are accepted by less intelligent men to be the end of yoga, but
actually they are meant to concentrate the mind upon the Supersoul. After
creating persons for economic development, Brahma created sages who
would set the example for spiritual realization.

To each one of these sons the unborn creator of the universe gave a part
of his own body, which was characterized by deep meditation, mental

PURPORT
The word viraktimat in this verse means possessed of the qualifi-
cation of renunciation. Spiritual realization cannot be attained by
materialistic persons. For those who are addicted to sense enjoyment,
spiritual realization is not possible. In Bhagavad-gita it is stated that those
who are too attached to seeking material possessions and material enjoy-
ment cannot reach yoga-samadhi, absorption in Krsna consciousness.
Propaganda that one can enjoy this life materially and at the same time

spiritually advance is simply bogus. The principles of renunciation are
four: (1) to avoid illicit sex life, (2) to avoid meat-eating, (3) to avoid
intoxication and (4) to avoid gambling. These four principles are called
tapasya, or austerity. To absorb the mind in the Supreme in Krsna
consciousness is the process of spiritual realization.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Third Canto, Twentieth
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled ‘Conversation Between
Maitreya and Vidura.”

TRANSLATION
Vidura said: The line of Svayambhuva Manu was most esteemed. O wor-
shipful sage, I beg you—give me an account of this race, whose progeny
multiplied through sexual intercourse.
PURPORT
Regulated sex life to generate good population is worth accepting.
Actually, Vidura was not interested in hearing the history of persons who
merely engaged in sex life, but he was interested in the progeny of
Svayambhuva Manu because in that dynasty, good devotee-kings appeared
who protected their subjects very carefully with spiritual knowledge. By
hearing the history of their activities, therefore, one becomes more
enlightened. An important word used in this connection is parama-
sammatah, which indicates that the progeny created by Svayambhuva Manu

for creating exemplary population is acceptable to all sages and authorities
of Vedic scripture.

The two great sons of Svayambhuva Manu—Priyavrata and Uttanapada—
ruled the world, consisting of seven islands, just according to religious
principles.
PURPORT
Srimad-Bhagavatam is also a history of the great rulers of different parts
of the universe. In this verse the names of Priyavrata and Uttanapada, sons
of Svayambhuva, are mentioned. They ruled this earth, which is divided
into seven islands. These seven islands are still current, as Asia, Europe,
Africa, America, Australia and the North and South Poles. There is no
chronological history of all the Indian kings in Srimad-Bhagavatam, but the
deeds of the most important kings, such as Priyavrata and Uttanapada, and
many others like Lord Ramacandra and Maharaja Yudhisthira, are recorded
because the activities of such pious kings are worth hearing; people may
benefit by studying their histories.

PURPORT
Here we are speaking of Svayambhuva Manu, but in Bhagavad-gita we
hear about Vaivasvata Manu. The present age belongs to the Vaivasvata
Manu. Svayambhuva Manu was previously ruling, and his history begins
from the Varaha Age, or the millennium when the Lord appeared as the
boar. There are fourteen Manus in one day of the life of Brahma, and in
the life of each Manu there are particular incidents. The Vaivasvata Manu
of Bhagavad-gita is different from Svayambhuva Manu.

TRANSLATION

How many offspring did that great yogi beget through the princess, who
was endowed with eightfold perfection in the yoga principles? O, pray
tell me this, for I am eager to hear it.

PURPORT

Here Vidura inquired about Kardama Muni and his wife Devahati and
about their children. It is described here that Devahuti was very much
advanced in the performance of eightfold yoga. The eight divisions of
yoga performance are described as (1) control of the senses, (2) strict fol-
lowing of the rules and regulations, (3) practice of the different sitting pos-
tures, (4) control of the breath, (5) withdrawing the senses from sense ob-
jects, (6) concentration of the mind, (7) meditation and (8) self-realization.
After self-realization there are eight further perfectional stages, which
are called yoga-siddhis. The husband and wife, Kardama and Devahuti, were
advanced in yoga practice; the husband was a maha-yogi, great mystic, and
the wife was a yoga-laksana, or one advanced in yoga. They united and
produced children. Formerly, after making their lives perfect, great sages
and saintly persons used to beget children, otherwise they strictly observed
the rules and regulations of celibacy. Brahmacarya (following the rules
and regulations of celibacy) is required for perfection of self-
realization and mystic power. There is no recommendation in the Vedic
scriptures that one can go on enjoying material sense gratification at one’s
whims, as one likes, and at the same time become a great meditator by
paying a rascal some money.

PURPORT
All the great personalities who increased the population in the beginning
of the creation are called prajapatis. Brahma is also known as prajapati,
as were some of his later sons. Svayambhuva Manu is also known as
prajapati, as is Daksa, another son of Brahma. Svayambhuva had two
daughters, Akiiti and Prasiiti. The prajapati Ruci married Akiti, and
Daksa married Prasuti. These couples and their children produced immense
numbers of children to populate the entire universe. Vidura’s inquiry was,
“How did they beget the population in the beginning?”

806 $rimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 21
PURPORT

It is understood herein that Kardama Muni meditated in yoga for
10,000 years before attaining perfection. Similarly, we have information
that Valmiki Muni also practiced yoga meditation for 60,000 years before
attaining perfection. Therefore, yoga practice can be successfully per-
formed by persons who have a very long duration of life, such as
100,000 years; in that way it is possible to have perfection in yoga.
Otherwise, there is no possibility of attaining the real perfection. Following
the regulations, controlling the senses and practicing the different sitting
postures are merely the preliminary practices. We do not know how people
can be captivated by the bogus yoga system in which it is stated that
simply by meditating fifteen minutes daily one can attain the perfection of
becoming one with God. This age (Kali-yuga) is the age of bluffing and
quarrel. Actually there is no possibility of attaining yoga perfection by such
paltry proposals. The Vedic literature, for emphasis, clearly states three
times that in this age of Kali—kalau nasty eva nasty eva nasty eva—there is no
other alternative, no other alternative, no other alternative than harer
nama, chanting the holy name of the Lord.

During that period of penance, the sage Kardama, by worship through

is the quick bestower of all blessings upon those who flee to Him for pro-
tection.


--- Page 129 ---
Text 7] Conversation Between Manu and Kardama 807
PURPORT

The significance of meditation is described here. Kardama Muni
practiced mystic yoga meditation for 10,000 years just to please the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari. Therefore, whether one practices
yoga or speculates and does research to find God, his efforts must be mixed
with the process of devotion. Without devotion, nothing can be perfect.
The target of perfection and realization is the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. In the Sixth Chapter of Bhagavad-gita it is clearly said that one
who constantly engages in Krsna consciousness is the topmost yogi. The
Personality of Godhead, Hari, also fulfills the desires of His surrendered
devotee. One has to surrender unto the lotus feet of the Personality of
Godhead, Hari, or Krsna, in order to achieve real success. Devotional
service or engagement in Krsna consciousness is the direct method, and all
other methods, although recommended, are indirect. In this age of Kali the
direct method is especially more feasible than the indirect because people
are short-living, their intelligence is poor, and they are poverty-stricken and
embarrassed by so many miserable disturbances. Lord Caitanya, therefore,
has given the greatest boon: in this age one simply has to chant the holy
name of God to attain perfection in spiritual life.

The words samprapede harim mean that in various ways Kardama Muni
satisfied the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, by his devotional
service. Devotional service is also expressed by the word kriya-yogena.
Kardama Muni not only meditated, but he also engaged in devotional
service; to attain perfection in yoga practice or meditation, one must act
in devotional service by hearing, chanting, remembering, etc. Remembering
is meditation also. But who is to be remembered? One should remember
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Not only must one remember the Su-
preme Person; one must hear about the activities of the Lord and
chant His glories. This information is in the authoritative scriptures.
After engaging himself for 10,000 years in performing different types
of devotional service, Kardama Muni attained the perfection of meditation,
but that is not possible in this age of Kali, wherein it is very difficult to
live for as much as 100 years. At the present moment, who will be
successful in the rigid performance of the many yoga rules and regulations?
Moreover, perfection is attained only by those who are surrendered souls.
Where there is no mention of the Personality of Godhead, where is there
surrender? And where there is no meditation upon the Personality of
Godhead, where is the yoga practice? Unfortunately, people in this age,
especially persons who are of a demoniac nature, want to be cheated. Thus
the Supreme Personality of Godhead sends great cheaters who mislead


--- Page 130 ---
808 $rimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 21
them in the name of yoga and render their lives useless and doomed. In
Bhagavad-gita, therefore, it is clearly stated, in the Sixteenth Chapter,
seventeenth verse, that rascals of self-made authority, being puffed up by
illegally collected money, perform yoga without following the authoritative
books. They are very proud of the money they have plundered from
innocent persons who wanted to be cheated.

TRANSLATION
Then, in the Satya-yuga, the lotus-eyed Supreme Personality of Godhead,
being pleased, showed Himself to that Kardama Muni and displayed His
transcendental form, which can be understood only through the Vedas.
PURPORT
Here two points are very significant. The first is that Kardama Muni
attained success by yoga practice in the beginning of Satya-yuga, when
people used to live for 100,000 years. Kardama Muni attained success, and
the Lord, being pleased with him, showed him His form, which is not
imaginary. Sometimes the impersonalists recommend that one can arbi-
trarily concentrate one’s mind on some form he imagines or which pleases
him. But here it is very clearly said that the form which the Lord showed
to Kardama Muni by His divine grace is described in the Vedic literature.
Sabdari brahma: The forms of the Lord are clearly indicated in the Vedic
literature. Kardama Muni did not discover any imaginary form of God, as

alleged by rascals, but he actually saw the eternal, blissful and transcenden-

of curly hair.

PURPORT

The descriptions in verses 9-11 of the Lord in His transcendental eternal
form are understood to be descriptions from the authoritative Vedic
version. These descriptions are certainly not the imagination of Kardama
Muni. The decorations of the Lord are beyond material conception, as
admitted even by impersonalists like Suiikaracarya: Narayana, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, has nothing to do with material creation. The
varieties of the transcendental Lord—-Ilis body, His form, His dress, His
instruction, His words—are not manufactured by the material energy, but
are all confirmed in the Vedic literature. By performance of yoga Kardama
Muni actually saw the Supreme Lord as He is. There was no point in seeing
an imagined form of God after practicing yoga for 10,000 years. The per-
fection of yoga, therefore, does not terminate in voidness or impersonal-
ism; on the contrary, the perfection of yoga is attained when one actually


--- Page 133 ---
Text 12] Conversation Between Manu and Kardama 811
sees the Personality of Godhead in His eternal form. The process of Krsna
consciousness is to deliver the form of Krsna directly. The form of Krsna is
described in the authoritative Vedic literature Brahma-sarihita: His abode
is made of cintamapi stone, and the Lord plays there as ৪ cowherd boy
and is served by many thousands of gopis. These descriptions are authori-
tative, and a Krsna conscious person takes them directly, acts on them,
preaches them and practices devotional service as enjoined in the authori-
tative scriptures.

TRANSLATION

When Kardama Muni actually realized the Supreme Personality of God-
head in person, he was greatly satisfied because his transcendental desire
was fulfilled. He fell on the ground with his head bowed to offer
obeisances unto the lotus feet of the Lord. His heart naturally full of love
of God, with folded hands he satisfied the Lord with prayers.

PURPORT

The realization of the personal form of the Lord is the highest perfec-
tional stage of yoga. In the Sixth Chapter of Bhagavad-gita, where yoga
practice is described, this realization of the personal form of the Lord is
called the perfection of yoga. After practicing the sitting postures and
other regulative principles of the system, one finally reaches the stage of
samadhi—absorption in the Supreme. In the samadhi stage one can see the
Supreme Personality of Godhead in His partial form as Paramatma, or as


--- Page 134 ---
812 $rimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 21
He is. Samadhi is described in authoritative yoga scriptures, such as the
Patanjali-siitras, to be a transcendental pleasure. The yoga system described
in the books of Pataiijali is authoritative, and the modern so-called yogis
who have manufactured their own ways, not consulting the authorities, are
simply ludicrous. The Patanjali yoga system is called astaiga-yoga. Some-
times impersonalists pollute the Pataijali yoga system because they are
monists. Pataiijali describes that the soul is transcendentally pleased when
he meets the Supersoul and sees Him. If the existence of the Supersoul and
the individual is admitted, then the impersonalist theory of monism is
nullified. Therefore some impersonalists and void philosophers twist the
Patanjali system in their own way and pollute the whole yoga process.

According to Pataiijali, when one becomes free from all material desires
he attains his real transcendental situation, and realization of that stage is
called spiritual power. In material activities a person engages in the modes
of material nature. The aspirations of such people are (1) to be religious,
(2) to be economically enriched, (3) to be able to gratify the senses, and at
last, (4) to become one with the Supreme. According to the monists, when
a yogi becomes one with the Supreme and loses his individual existence,
that is the highest stage, called kaivalya. But actually the stage of realiza-
tion of the Personality of Godhead is kaivalya. The oneness of understand-
ing that the Supreme Lord is fully spiritual and that in full spiritual realiza-
tion one can understand what He is—the Supreme Personality of Godhead—
is called kaivalya, or, in the language of Patanjali, realization of spiritual
power. His proposal is that when one is freed from material desires and
fixed in spiritual realization of the self and the Superself, that is called
cit-sakti. In full spiritual realization there is a perception of spiritual
happiness, and that happiness is described in Bhagavad-gita as the supreme
happiness, which is beyond the material senses. Trance is described to be
of two kinds, samprajiiata and asamprajiiata, or mental speculation and
self-realization. In samadhi or asamprajiiata, one can realize, by his
spiritual senses, the spiritual form of the Lord. That is the ultimate goal of
spiritual realization.

According to Pataiijali, when one is fixed in constant realization of the
supreme form of the Lord, that is the perfectional stage, as attained by
Kardama Muni. Unless one attains this stage of perfection—beyond the
perfection of the preliminaries of the yoga system—there is no ultimate
realization. There are eight perfections in the astanga-yoga system. One
who has attained them can become lighter than the lightest and greater
than the greatest, and he can achieve whatever he likes. But even achieving
such material success in yoga is not the perfection or the ultimate goal.


--- Page 135 ---
Text 13] Conversation Between Manu and Kardama 813
The ultimate goal is described here: Kardama Muni saw the Supreme
Personality of Godhead in His eternal form. Devotional service begins with
the relationship of the individual soul and the Supreme Soul, or Krsna
and Krsna’s devotees, and when one attains it there is no question of fall-
ing down. If, through the yoga system, onc wants to attain the stage of
seeing the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face, but is attracted
instead to attainment of some material power, then he is detoured from
proceeding further. Material enjoyment, as encouraged by bogus yogis,
has nothing to do with the transcendental realization of spiritual happiness.
Real devotees of bhakti-yoga accept only the material necessities of life
absolutely needed to maintain the body and soul together; they refrain
completely from all exaggerated material sense gratification. They are
prepared to undergo all kinds of tribulation, provided they can make
progress in the realization of the Personality of Godhead.

The great sage Kardama Muni said: O supreme worshipful Lord, my

814 $rimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 21
the sight of You, who are the reservoir of all existences. Through many
successive births of deep meditation, advanced yogis aspire to see Your
transcendental form.
PURPORT
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is described here as the reservoir
of all goodness and all pleasure. Unless one is situated in the mode of
goodness, there is no real pleasure. When, therefore, one’s body, mind and
activities are situated in the service of the Lord, that is the highest
perfectional stage of goodness. Kardama Muni says, “Your Lordship is the
reservoir of all that can be understood by the nomenclature of goodness,
and by experiencing You face to face, eye to eye, the perfection of sight
has now been attained.” These statements are the pure devotional situation;
for a devotee, the perfection of the senses is to engage in the service of the
Lord. The sense of sight, when engaged in seeing the beauty of the Lord,
is perfected; the power to hear, when engaged in hearing the glories of the
Lord, 15 perfected; the power to taste, when one enjoys by eating prasada,
is perfected. When all the senses engage in relationship with the Personality
of Godhead, that perfection is technically called bhakti-yoga, which entails
detaching the senses from material indulgence and attaching them to the
service of the Lord. When one is freed from all designated conditional life
and fully engages in the service of the Lord, that is called bhakti-yoga.
Kardama Muni admits that seeing the Lord personally in bhakti-yoga is the
perfection of sight. The exalted perfection of seeing the Lord is not
exaggerated by Kardama Muni. He gives evidence that those who are
actually elevated in yoga aspire in life after life to see this form of the
Personality of Godhead. He was not a fictitious yogi. Those who are
actually on the advanced path aspire only to see the eternal form of the
Lord.

TRANSLATION

Your lotus feet are the true vessel to take one across the ocean of mun-
dane nescience. Only persons deprived of their intelligence by the spell of
the deluding energy will worship those feet with a view to attain the
trivial and momentary pleasures of the senses, which even persons rotting
in hell can attain. However, O my Lord, You are so kind that You bestow
mercy even upon them.

PURPORT

As stated in Bhagavad-gita, Seventh Chapter, there are two kinds of
devotees—those who desire material pleasures, and those who desire noth-
ing but service to the Lord. Material pleasures can be attained even by
hogs and dogs, whose condition of life is hellish. The hog also eats, sleeps
and enjoys sex life to the full extent, and it is also very satisfied with
such hellish enjoyment of material existence. Modern yogis advise that
because one has senses, one must enjoy to the fullest extent like cats and
dogs, yet one can go on and practice yoga. This is condemned here by
Kardama Muni; he says that such material pleasures are available for cats
and dogs in a hellish condition. The Lord is so kind that if so-called yogis
are satisfied by hellish pleasures, He can give them facilities to attain all
the material pleasures they desire, but they cannot attain the perfectional
stage attained by Kardama Muni.

Hellish and demoniac persons do not actually know what is the ultimate
attainment in perfection, and therefore they think that sense gratification
is the highest goal of life. They advise that one can satisfy the senses and at
the same time, by reciting some mantra and by some practice, can cheaply
aspire for perfection. Such persons are described here as hata-medhasah,
which means those whose brains are spoiled. They aspire for material
enjoyment by perfection of yoga or meditation. In Bhagavad-gita it is
stated by the Lord that the intelligence of those who worship the demigods
has been spoiled. Similarly, here too it is stated by Kardama Muni that one
who aspires after material enjoyment by practice of yoga has spoiled his
brain substance and is fool number one. Actually, the intelligent practi-


--- Page 138 ---
816 $rimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 21
tioner of yoga should aspire for nothing else but to cross over the ocean of
nescience by worshiping the Personality of Godhead and to see the lotus
feet of the Lord. The Lord is so kind, however, that even today persons
whose brain substance is spoiled are given the benediction to become cats,
dogs or hogs and enjoy material happiness from sex life and sense gratifica-
tion. The Lord confirms this benediction in Bhagavad-gita: “Whatever a
person aspires to receive from Me, 1 offer him as he desires.”

Therefore, desiring to marry a girl of like disposition who may prove to

desire I too have sought the shelter of Your lotus feet, which are the source
of everything, for You are like a desire tree.
PURPORT
In spite of his condemning persons who approach the Lord for material
advantages, Kardama Muni expressed his material inability and desire
before the Lord by saying, “Although I know that nothing material should
be asked from You, I nevertheless desire to marry a girl of like disposition.”


--- Page 139 ---
Text 16] Conversation Between Manu and Kardama 817
The phrase “like disposition” is very significant. Formerly, boys and girls
of similar dispositions were married; the similar natures of the boy and
girl were united in order to make them happy. Not more than twenty-five
years ago, and perhaps it is still current, parents in India used to consult
the horoscope of the boy and girl to see whether there would be factual
union in their psychological conditions. These considerations are very
important. Nowadays marriage takes place without such consultation,
and therefore, soon after the marriage, there is divorce and separation.
Formerly husband and wife used to live together peacefully throughout
their whole lives, but nowadays it is a very difficult task.

Kardama Muni wanted to have a wife of like disposition because a wife
is necessary to assist in spiritual and material advancement. It is said that a
wife yields the fulfillment of all desires in religion, economic development
and sense gratification. If one has a nice wife, he is to be considered a most
fortunate man. In astrology, a man is considered fortunate who has great
wealth, very good sons or a very good wife. Of these three, one who has a
very good wife is considered the most fortunate. Before marrying, one
should select a wife of like disposition and not be enamored by so-called
beauty or other attractive features for sense gratification. In the
Bhagavatam, Twelfth Canto, it is said that in the Kali-yuga marriage will
be based in the consideration of sex life; as soon as there is deficiency in
sex life, the question of divorce will arise.

Kardama Muni could have asked his benediction from Uma, for it is
recommended in the scriptures that if anyone wants a good wife, he should
worship Uma. But he preferred to worship the Supreme Personality of
Godhead because it is recommended in the Bhagavatam that everyone,
whether he is full of desires, has no desire, or desires liberation, should
worship the Supreme Lord. Of these three classes of men, one tries to be
happy by fulfillment of material desires, another wants to be happy by
becoming one with the Supreme, and another, the perfect man, is a
devotee. He does not want anything in return from the Personality of
Godhead; he only wants to render transcendental loving service. In any
case, everyone should worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for
He will fulfill everyone’s desire. The advantage of worshiping the Supreme
Person is that even if one has desires for material enjoyment, if he wor-
ships Krsna he will gradually become a pure devotee and have no more
material hankering.

TRANSLATION

O my Lord, You are the master and leader of all living entities. Under
Your direction, all conditioned souls, as if bound by rope, are constantly
engaged in satisfying their desires. Following them, O embodiment of
religion, I also bear oblations for You, who are eternal time.

PURPORT

In the Katha Upanisad it is stated that the Supreme Lord is the leader
of all living entities. He is their sustainer and the awarder of all their
necessities and desires. No living entity is independent; all are dependent
on the mercy of the Supreme Lord. Therefore the Vedic instruction is that
one should enjoy life under the direction of the supreme leader, the
Personality of Godhead. Vedic literatures like Isopanisad direct that since
everything belongs to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one should
not encroach upon another’s property, but should enjoy his individual
allotment. The best program for every living entity is to take direction
from the Supreme Lord and enjoy material or spiritual life.

A question may be raised: Since Kardama Muni was advanced in spiritual
life, why then did he not ask the Lord for liberation? Why did he want to
enjoy material life in spite of his personally seeing and experiencing the
Supreme Lord? The answer is that not everyone is competent to be
liberated from material bondage. It is everyone’s duty, therefore, to enjoy
according to his present position, but under the direction of the Lord or
the Vedas. The Vedas are considered to be the direct words of the Lord.


--- Page 141 ---
Text 17] Conversation Between Manu and Kardama 819
The Lord gives us the opportunity to enjoy material life as we want, and
at the same time He gives directions for the modes and processes of abiding
by the Vedas so that gradually one may be elevated to liberation from
material bondage. The conditioned souls who have come to the material
world to fulfill their desires to lord it over material nature are bound by
the laws of nature. The best course is to abide by the Vedic rules; that will
help one to be gradually elevated to liberation.

Kardama Muni addresses the Lord as sukla, which means the leader of
religion. One who is pious should follow the rules of religion, for such
rules are prescribed by the Lord Himself. No one can manufacture or
concoct a religion; religion refers to the injunctions or laws of the Lord.
In Bhagavad-gita the Lord says that religion means to surrender unto Him.
Therefore one should follow the Vedic regulations and surrender unto the
Supreme Lord because that is the ultimate goal of perfection in human life.
One should live a life of piety, follow the religious rules and regulations,
marry and live peacefully for elevation to the higher status of spiritual
realization.

Your lotus feet by drinking the intoxicating nectar of Your qualities and
activities in discussions with one another, can be freed from the primary
necessities of the material body.

PURPORT

After describing the necessity of married life, Kardama Muni asserts that
marriage and other social affairs are stereotyped regulations for persons
who are addicted to material sense enjoyment. The principles of animal
life—eating, sleeping, mating and defending—are actually necessities of the
body, but those who engage in transcendental Krsna consciousness, giving
up all the stereotyped activities of this material world, are freed from
social conventions. Conditioned souls are under the spell of material
energy or eternal time—past, present and future—but as soon as one engages
in Krsna consciousness he transcends the limits of past and present and
becomes situated in the eternal activities of the soul. One has to act in
terms of the Vedic injunctions in order to enjoy material life, but those
who have taken to the devotional service of the Lord are not afraid of the
regulations of this material world. Such devotees do not care for the
conventions of material activities; they boldly take to that shelter which is
like an umbrella against the sun of repeated birth and death.

Constant transmigration of the soul from one body to another is the
cause of suffering in material existence. This conditional life in material
existence is called sarnsdra. One may perform good work and take his
birth in a very nice material condition, but the process under which birth
and death takes place is like a terrible fire. Sri Visvanatha Cakravarti
Thakura, in his prayer to the spiritual master, has described this. Samsara,
or the repetition of birth and death, is compared to a forest fire. A forest
fire takes place automatically, without anyone’s endeavor, by the friction
of dried wood, and no fire department or sympathetic person can extin-
guish it. The raging forest fire can be extinguished only when there is a
constant downpour of water from a cloud. The cloud is compared to the
mercy of the spiritual master. By the grace of the spiritual master the
cloud of the mercy of the Personality of Godhead is brought in, and then
only, when the rains of Krsna consciousness fall, can the fire of material
existence be extinguished. This is also explained here. In order to find
freedom from the stereotyped conditional life of material existence, one
has to take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord, not in the manner in
which the impersonalists indulge, but in devotional service, chanting and
hearing of the activities of the Lord. Only then can one be freed from the
actions and reactions of material existence. It is recommended here that


--- Page 143 ---
Text 18] Conversation Between Manu and Kardama 821
one should give up the conditional life of this material world and the
association of so-called civilized human beings who are simply following,
in a polished way, the same stereotyped principles of eating, sleeping,
defending and mating. Chanting and hearing of the glories of the Lord is
described here as tvad-guna-vada-sidhu. Only by drinking the nectar of
chanting and hearing the pastimes of the Lord can one forget the intoxica-
tion of material existence.

span of the entire creation, this wheel of tremendousvelocity cannot touch
the life span of the devotees of the Lord.
PURPORT
The time factor cannot affect the span of life of the devotees. In
Bhagavad-gita it is stated that a little execution of devotional service saves
one from the greatest danger. The greatest danger is transmigration of the
soul from one body to another, and only devotional service to the Lord


--- Page 144 ---
822 $rimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 21
can stop this process. It is stated in the Vedic literatures, hari vina
na srtim taranti: Without the mercy of the Lord, one cannot stop the
cycle of birth and death. In Bhagavad-gita it is stated that only by under-
standing the transcendental nature of the Lord and His activities, His
appearance and disappearance, can one stop the cycle of death and go back
to Him. The time factor is divided into many fractions of moments, hours,
months, years, periods, seasons, etc. All the divisions in this verse are
determined according to the astronomical calculations of Vedic literature.
There are six seasons, called rtus, and there is the period of four months
called catur-masya. Three periods of four months complete one year.
According to Vedic astronomical calculations, there are thirteen months.
The thirteenth month is called adhi-masa or mala-masa and is added every
third year. The time factor, however, cannot touch the life span of the
devotees. In another verse it is stated that when the sun rises and
sets it takes away the life of all living entities, but it cannot take away
the life of those who engage in devotional service. Time is compared here
to a big wheel which has 360 joints, six rims in the shape of seasons and
numberless leaves in the shape of moments. It rotates on the eternal
existence, Brahman.

TRANSLATION
My dear Lord, You alone create the universes. O Personality of Godhead,
desiring to create these universes, You create them, maintain them, and
again wind them up by Your own energies, which are under the control of
Your second energy, called yogamaya, just as a spider creates a cobweb by
its own energy and again winds it up.
PURPORT
In this verse two important words nullify the impersonalist theory that
everything is God. Here Kardama says, 0 Personality of Godhead, You are
alone, but You have various energies.” The example of the spider is very
significant also. The spider is an individual living entity, and by its energy
it creates a cobweb and plays on it, and whenever it likes it winds up the
cobweb, thus ending the play. When the cobweb is manufactured by the
saliva of the spider, the spider does not become impersonal. Similarly the
creation and manifestation of the material or spiritual energy does not
render the creator impersonal. Here the very prayer suggests that God is
sentient and can hear the prayers and fulfill the desires of the devotee.
Therefore, He is sac-cid-ananda-vigraha, the form of bliss, knowledge and
eternity.

My dear Lord, although it is not Your desire, You nevertheless manifest
this creation of gross and subtle elements just for our sensual satisfaction.
Let Your causeless mercy be upon us, for You have appeared before us in
Your eternal form, adorned with a splendid wreath of tulasi leaves.

PURPORT

It is clearly stated here that the material world is not created by the
personal will of the Supreme Lord; it is created by His external energy
because the living entities want to enjoy it. This material world is not
created for those who do not want to enjoy sense gratification, who
constantly remain in transcendental loving service and who are eternally
Krsna conscious. For them, the spiritual world is eternally existing, and
they enjoy there. Elsewhere in the Srimad-Bhagavatam it is stated that
for those who have taken shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, this material world is useless; because this material
world is full of danger at every step, it is therefore not meant for the
devotees but for living entities who want to lord it over the material energy
at their own risk. Krsna is so kind that He allows the sense-enjoying
living entities a separate world created by Him to enjoy as they like, yet at
the same time He appears in His personal form. The Lord unwillingly
creates this material world, but He descends in His personal form or sends
one of His reliable sons or a servant or a reliable author like Vyasadeva to
give instruction. He Himself also instructs in His speeches of Bhagavad-gita.
This propaganda work goes on side by side with the creation to convince
the misguided living entities who are rotting in this material world to come
back to Him and surrender unto Him. Therefore the last instruction of
Bhagavad-gita is this: “Give up all your manufactured engagements in the
material world, and just surrender unto Me. I shall protect you from all
sinful reactions.”

I continuously offer my respectful obeisances unto Your lotus feet, of
which it is worthy to take shelter, because You shower all benedictions on
the insignificant. To give all living entities detachment from fruitive ac-
tivity by realizing You, You have expanded these material worlds by Your
own energy.

PURPORT

Everyone, therefore, whether he desires material enjoyment, liberation
or the transcendental loving service of the Lord, should engage himself,
offering obeisances unto the Supreme Lord, because the Lord can award
everyone his desired benediction. In Bhagavad-gita the Lord affirms,
ye yatha mam prapadyante: Anyone who desires to be a successful enjoyer
in this material world is awarded that benediction by the Lord, anyone who
wants to be liberated from the entanglement of this material world is given
liberation by the Lord, and anyone who desires to constantly engage in His
service in full Krsna consciousness is awarded that benediction by the Lord.
For material enjoyment He has prescribed so many ritualistic sacrificial
performances in the Vedas, and thus people may take advantage of those
instructions and enjoy material life in higher planets or in a noble
aristocratic family. These processes are mentioned in the Vedas, and one
can take advantage of them. It is similar with those who want to be
liberated from this material world.

Unless one is disgusted with the enjoyment of this material world, he
cannot aspire for liberation. Liberation is for one who is disgusted with
material enjoyment. Vedanta-sitra says, therefore, athato brahma-
jijiasa: Those who have given up the attempt to be happy in this material
world can inquire about the Absolute Truth. For those who want to know
the Absolute Truth, the Vedanta-sutra is available, as is Srimad-Bhagavatam,


--- Page 148 ---
826 $rimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 21
the actual explanation of Vedanta-sutra. Since Bhagavad-gita is also
Vedanta-sutra, by understanding Srimad-Bhagavatam, Vedanta-sutra or
Bhagavad-gita one can obtain real knowledge. When one obtains real knowl-
edge, he becomes theoretically one with the Supreme, and when he actually
begins the service of Brahman, or Krsna consciousness, he is not only
liberated but situated in his spiritual life. Similarly, for those who want to
lord it over material nature, there are so many departments of material
enjoyment; material knowledge and material science are available, and the
Lord provides for persons who want to enjoy them. The conclusion is that
one should worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead for any benedic-
tion. The word kama-varsam is very significant, for it indicates that He
satisfies the desires of anyone who approaches Him. But one who sincerely
loves Krsna and yet wants material enjoyment is in perplexity. Krsna, being
very kind towards him, gives him an opportunity to engage in the transcen-
dental loving service of the Lord, and so he gradually forgets the
hallucination.

sweet as nectar. His eyebrows moved gracefully as He looked at the sage
with a smile full of affection.
PURPORT
The word vacasamrtena is significant. Whenever the Lord speaks, He
speaks from the transcendental world. He does not speak from the mate-
rial world. Since He is transcendental, His speech is also transcendental,
as is His activity; everything in relation to Him is transcendental. The
word amrta refers to one who does not meet with death. The words and
activities of the Lord are deathless; therefore they are not manufactured
of this material world. The sound of this material world and that of the
spiritual world are completely different. The sound of the spiritual world
is nectarean and eternal, whereas the sound of the material world is
hackneyed and subject to end. The sound of the holy name—Hare Krsna,
Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare—everlastingly increases the enthusiasm
of the chanter. If one repeats monotonous material words, he will feel
exhausted, but if he chants Hare Krsna twenty-four hours a day, he will
never feel exhausted; rather, he will feel encouraged to continue chanting
more and more. When the Lord replied to the sage Kardama, the word
vacasamrtena is specifically mentioned, since He spoke from the transcen-
dental world. He replied in transcendental words, and when He spoke His
eyebrows moved with great affection. When a devotee praises the glories
of the Lord, the Lord is very satisfied, and He bestows His transcendental
benediction upon the devotee without reservation because He is always
causelessly merciful towards His devotee.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead in His Paramatma feature is
situated in everyone’s heart. He knows, therefore, the past, present and
future of every individual person as well as his desires, activities and
everything about him. It is stated in Bhagavad-gita that He is seated in the
heart as a witness. The Personality of Godhead knew the heart’s desire of
Kardama Muni, and He had already arranged for the fulfillment of his
desires. He never disappoints a sincere devotee, regardless of what he wants,
but He never allows anything which will be detrimental to the individual's
devotional service.

TRANSLATION
The Lord continued: My dear पटा, O leader of the living entities, for any-
one who serves Me in devotion by worshiping Me, especially persons like
you who have given up everything unto Me, there is never any question of
frustration.
PURPORT
Even if he has some desires, anyone engaged in the service of the Lord is
never frustrated. Those engaged in His service are called sakama and
akama. Those who approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead with
desires for material enjoyment are called sakama, and those devotees who
have no material desires for sense gratification but serve the Supreme Lord
out of spontaneous love for Him are called akama. Sakama devotees are
divided into four classes—those in distress, those in need of money, the
inquisitive and the wise. Someone worships the Supreme Lord because of
bodily or mental distress, someone else worships the Supreme Lord because
he is in need of money, someone else worships the Lord out of inquisitive-
ness to know Him as He is, and someone wants to know the Lord as a
philosopher can know Him, by the research work of his wisdom. There is
no frustration for any of these four classes of men; each is endowed with
the desired result of his worship.

PURPORT
Sometimes it is stated that Brahmavarta is a part of Kuruksetra or that
Kuruksetra itself is situated in Brahmavarta because the demigods are
recommended to perform spiritual ritualistic performances in Kuruksetra.
But in others’ opinion, Brahmavarta is a place in Brahmaloka where
Svayambhuva ruled. There are many places on the surface of this earth
which are also known in the higher planetary systems; we have places on
this planet like Vrndavana, Dvaraka and Mathura, but they are also eter-
nally situated in Krsnaloka. There are many similar names on the surface
of the earth, and it may be that in the Boar Age Svayambhuva Manu ruled
this planet, as stated here. The word mangalah is significant. Maingala
means one who is elevated in every respect in the opulences of religious
performances, ruling power, cleanliness and all other good qualities.
Vikhyata means celebrated. Svayambhuva Manu was celebrated for all
good qualities and opulences.

searching for a good husband. My dear sir, her parents will come to see you,
who are exactly suitable for her, just to deliver their daughter as your wife.
PURPORT
The selection of a good husband for a good girl was always entrusted
to the parents. Here it is clearly stated that Manu and his wife were coming
to see Kardama Muni to offer their daughter because the daughter was well
qualified and the parents were searching out a similarly qualified man. This
is the duty of parents. Girls are never thrown into the public street to
search out their husband because when girls are grown up and are searching
after a boy, they forget to consider whether the boy they select is actually
suitable for them. Out of the urge of sex desire, a girl may accept anyone,
but if the husband is chosen by the parents, they can consider who is to be
selected and who is not. According to the Vedic system, therefore, the
girl is given over to a suitable boy by the parents, but she is never allowed
to select her own husband independently.

TRANSLATION

That princess, O holy sage, will be just the type you have been thinking
of in your heart for all these long years. She will soon be yours and will
serve you to your heart’s content.

PURPORT

The Lord awards all benedictions according to the heart’s desire of a
devotee, so the Lord informed Kardama Muni, “The girl who is coming to
be married with you is a princess, the daughter of Emperor Svayambhuva,
and so just suitable for your purpose.” Only by God’s grace can one get a
nice wife just as he desires. Similarly, it is only by God’s grace that a girl
gets a husband suitable to her heart. Thus it is said that if we pray to the
Supreme Lord in every transaction of our material existence, everything
will be done very nicely and just suitable to our heart’s desire. In other
words, in all circumstances we must take shelter of the Supreme Person-
ality of Godhead and depend completely on His decision. Man proposes,
God disposes. The fulfillment of desires, therefore, should be entrusted to
the Supreme Personality of Godhead; that is the nicest solution. Kardama
Muni desired only a wife, but because he was a devotee of the Lord, the
Lord selected a wife for him who was the Emperor's daughter, a princess.
Thus Kardama Muni got a wife beyond his expectation. If we depend on
the choice of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we will receive bene-
dictions in greater opulence than we desire.

It is also significantly noted here that Kardama Muni was a brahmana,
whereas Emperor Svayambhuva was a ksatriya. Therefore, intercaste mar-
riage was current even in those days. The system was that a brahmana
could marry the daughter of a ksatriya, but a ksatriya could not marry the
daughter of a brahmana. We have evidences from the history of the Vedic
age that Sukracarya offered his daughter to Maharaja Yayati, but the king
had to refuse to marry the daughter of a brahmana; only with the special
permission of the brahmana could they marry. Intercaste marriage, there-
fore, was not prohibited in the olden days, many millions of years ago, but
there was a regular system of social behavior.

--- Page 156 ---
834 $rimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 21
PURPORT
Here the words tirthikrtasesa-kriyarthah are significant. Tirthi means a
sanctified place where charity is given. People used to go to places of
pilgrimage and give munificently in charity. This system is still current.
Therefore the Lord said, “In order to sanctify your activities and the
results of your actions, you will offer everything unto Me.” This is also
confirmed in Bhagavad-gita: “Whatever you do, whatever you eat, what-
ever you sacrifice, the result should be given to Me only.” In another
place in Bhagavad-gita the Lord said, “I am the enjoyer of all sacrifices,
all penances and everything done for the welfare of mankind or society.”
All activities, therefore, whether for the welfare of family, society, country
or humanity at large, must be performed in Krsna consciousness. That is
the instruction given by the Lord to Kardama Muni. Maharaja Yudhisthira
welcomed Narada Muni: “Wherever you are present, that place becomes
sanctified because the Lord Himself is always seated in your heart.”
Similarly, if we act in Krsna consciousness under the direction of the Lord
and His representative, then everything is sanctified. This is the indication
given to Kardama Muni, who acted on it and therefore received the most
excellent wife and child, as will be disclosed in later verses.

--- Page 157 ---
Text 31] Conversation Between Manu and Kardama 835
PURPORT

The simple process of self-realization for every living entity is described
here. The first principle to be understood is that this world is a product of
the supreme will. There is an identity of this world with the Supreme Lord.
This identity is accepted in a misconceived way by the impersonalists;
they say that the Supreme Absolute Truth, transforming Himself into the
universe, loses His separate existence. Thus they accept the world and
everything in it to be the Lord. That is pantheism, wherein everything is
considered to be the Lord. This is the view of the impersonalist. But
those who are personal devotees of the Lord take everything to be the
property of the Supreme Lord. Everything, whatever we see, is the mani-
festation of the Supreme Lord; therefore, everything should be engaged in
the service of the Lord. This is oneness. The difference between the
impersonalist and the personalist is that the impersonalist does not accept
the separate existence of the Lord, but the personalist accepts the Lord;
he understands that although He distributes Himself in so many ways, He
has His separate personal existence. This is described in Bhagavad-gita: "व
am spread all over the universe in My impersonal form. Everything is
resting on Me, but I am not present.” There is a nice example regarding the
sun and the sunshine. The sun, by its sunshine, is spread all over the
universe, and all the planets rest on the sunshine. But all the planets are
different from the sun planet; one cannot say that because the planets are
resting on the sunshine, these planets are also the sun. Similarly, the
impersonal or pantheistic view that everything is God is not a very intelli-
gent proposal. The real position, as explained by the Lord Himself, is that
although nothing can exist without Him, it is not a fact that everything is
Him. He is different from everything. So here also the Lord says: “You
will see everything in the world to be nondifferent from Me.” This means
that everything should be considered a product of the Lord’s energy, and
therefore everything should be employed in the service of the Lord. One’s
energy should be utilized for one’s self-interest. That is the perfection of
the energy.

This energy can be utilized for real self-interest if one is compassionate.
A person in Krsna consciousness, a devotee of the Lord, is always com-
passionate. He is not satisfied that only he himself is a devotee, but he tries
to distribute the knowledge of devotional service to everyone. There are
many devotees of the Lord who faced many risks in distributing the
devotional service of the lord to people in general. That should be done.

It is also said that a person who goes to the temple of the Lord and
worships with great devotion, but who does not show sympathy to people


--- Page 158 ---
836 $rimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 21
in general or show respect to other devotees, is considered to be a third-
class devotee. The second-class devotee is he who is merciful and compas-
sionate to the fallen soul. The second-class devotee is always cognizant of
his position as an eternal servant of the Lord; he therefore makes friend-
ships with devotees of the Lord, acts compassionately towards the general
public in teaching them devotional service, and refuses to cooperate or
associate with nondevotees. As long as one is not compassionate to people
in general in his devotional service to the Lord, he is a third-class devotee.
The first-class devotee gives assurance to every living being that there is no
fear of this material existence: “‘Let us live in Krsna consciousness and
conquer the nescience of material existence.”

It is indicated here that Kardama Muni was directed by the Lord to be
very compassionate and liberal in his householder life and to give assurance
to the people in his renounced life. A sannyasi, one in the renounced order
of life, is meant to give enlightenment to the people. He should travel,
going from home to home to enlighten. The householder, by the spell of
maya, becomes absorbed in family affairs and forgets his relationship with
Krsna. If he dies in forgetfulness, like the cats and dogs, then his life is
spoiled. It is the duty of a sannyast, therefore, to go and awaken the for-
getful souls with enlightenment of their eternal relationship with the Lord
and to engage them in devotional service. The devotee should show mercy
to the fallen souls and also give them the assurance of fearlessness. As soon
as one becomes a devotee of the Lord, he is convinced that he is protected
by the Lord. Fear itself is afraid of the Lord; therefore, what has he to do
with fearfulness?

To award fearlessness to the common man is the greatest act of charity.
A sannyast, or one who is in the renounced order of life, should wander
from door to door, from village to village, from town to town and from
country to country, all over the world as far as he is able to travel, and
enlighten the householders about Krsna consciousness. A person who is a
householder but is initiated by a sannyast has the duty to spread Krsna
consciousness at home; as far as possible, he should call his friends and
neighbors to his house and hold classes in Krsna consciousness. Holding
a class means chanting the holy name of Krsna and speaking from
Bhagavad-gita or Srimad-Bhagavatam. There are immense literatures for
spreading Krsna consciousness, and it is the duty of each and every house-
holder to learn about Krsna from his sannyast spiritual master. There is a
division of labor in the Lord’s service. The householder’s duty is to earn
money because a sannyast is not supposed to earn money; he is completely
dependent on the householder. The householder should earn money by


--- Page 159 ---
Text 32] Conversation Between Manu and Kardama 837
business or by profession and spend at least fifty percent of his income to
spread Krsna consciousness; twenty-five percent he can spend for his
family, and twenty-five percent he should save to meet emergencies. This
example was shown by Riipa Gosvami, so devotees should follow it.

Actually, to be one with the Supreme Lord means to be one with the
interest of the Lord. Becoming one with the Supreme Lord does not imply
becoming as great as the Supreme Lord. 11 is impossible. The part is never
equal to the whole. The living entity is always a minute part. Therefore his
oneness with the Lord is that he is interested in the one interest of the
Lord. The Lord wants every living entity to always think about Him, to be
His devotee and always worship Him. This is clearly stated in Bhagavad-
gita: man-mand bhava mad-bhaktah. Krsna wants everyone to always think
of Him. Everyone should always offer obeisances to Krsna. This is the will
of the Supreme Lord, and devotees should try to fulfill His desire. Since
the Lord is unlimited, His desire is also unlimited. There is no stoppage,
and therefore the service of the devotee is also unlimited. In the transcen-
dental world there is unlimited competition between the Lord and the
servitor. The Lord wants to fulfill His desires unlimitedly, and the devotee
also serves Him to fulfill His unlimited desires. There is an unlimited
oneness of interest between the Lord and His devotee.

the system of philosophy that deals with the ultimate principles or
categories.

PURPORT

Herein the word svarsa-kalaya indicates that the Lord would appear as
the son of Devahuti and Kardama Muni as Kapiladeva, the first propounder
of the sankhya philosophy which is mentioned here as tattva-sarihita.
The Lord foretold to Kardama Muni that He would appear in [175 incarna-
tion of Kapiladeva and would propagate the philosophy of sarkhya.
Sankhya philosophy is very well known in the world as propagated by
another Kapiladeva, but that sdrikhya philosophy is different from the
sarkhya which was propounded by the Lord Himself. There are two kinds
of sankhya philosophy: one is godlesssarikhya philosophy, another godly
sarikhya philosophy. The saitkhya propagated by Kapiladeva, son of
Devahauti, is godly philosophy.

There are different manifestations of the Lord. He is one, but He has be-
come many. He divides Himself into two different expansions, one called
kala and the other vibhinnarisa. Ordinary living entities are called
vibhinndmsa expansions, and the unlimited expansions of vispu-tattva,
such as Vamana, Govinda, Narayana, Pradyumna, Vasudeva and Ananta,
are called svamsa-kala. Svarisa refers to a direct expansion, and kala
denotes an expansion from the expansion of the original Lord. Baladeva is
an expansion of Krsna, and from Baladeva the next expansion is Sankarsana;
thus Sarikarsana is kala, but Baladeva is svamsa. There is no difference
however, among Them. This is very nicely explained in the Brahma-sarhhita
(Bs. 5.46): diparcir eva hi dasantaram abhyupetya. With one candle one may
light a second candle, with the second a third and then a fourth, and in this
way one can light up thousands of candles, and no candle is inferior to
another in distributing light. Every candle has the full potential candle
power, but there is still the distinction that one candle is the first, another
the second, another the third and another the fourth. Similarly, there is
no difference between the immediate expansion of the Lord and His
secondary expansion. The Lord’s names are considered in exactly the same
way; since the Lord is absolute, His name, His form, His pastimes, His
paraphernalia and His quality all have the same potency. In the absolute
world, the name Krsna is the transcendental sound representation of the
Lord. There is no potential difference between His quality, name, form,
etc. If we chant the name of the Lord, Hare Krsna, that has as much
potency as the Lord Himself. There is no potential difference between the
form of the Lord whom we worship and the form of the Lord in the


--- Page 161 ---
Text 33] Conversation Between Manu and Kardama 839
temple. One should not think that he is worshiping a doll or statue of the
Lord, even if others consider it to be a statue. Because there is no potential
difference, one gets the same result by worshiping the statue of the Lord
or the Lord Himself. This is the science of Krsna consciousness.

PURPORT
One word in this verse is very significant. The Lord is stated here
to be pratyag-aksaja. He is imperceptible by material senses, but
still He can be seen. This appears to be contradictory. We have
material senses, but how can we see the Supreme Lord? He is called
adhoksaja, which means that He cannot be seen by the material senses.
Aksaja means knowledge perceived by material senses. Because the Lord is
not an object that can be understood by speculation with our material
senses, He is also called ajita; He will conquer, but no one can conquer Him.
What does it mean, then, that still He can be seen? It is explained that no


--- Page 162 ---
840 $rimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 21
one can hear the transcendental name of Krsna, no one can understand
His transcendental form, and no one can assimilate His transcendental pas-
times. It is not possible. Then how is it possible that He can be seen and
understood? When one is trained in devotional service and renders service
unto Him, gradually one’s senses are purified of material contamination.
When one’s senses are thus purified, then one can see, one can understand,
one can hear and so on. The purification of the material senses and percep-
tion of the transcendental form, name and quality of Krsna are combined
together in one word, pratyag-aksaja, which is used here.

TRANSLATION
While the sage stood looking on, the Lord left by the pathway leading
to Vaikuntha, a path extolled by all great liberated souls. The sage stood
listening as the hymns forming the basis of the Sama Veda were vibrated
by the flapping wings of the Lord’s carrier, Garuda.
PURPORT
In the Vedic literature it is stated that the two wings of the transcenden-
tal bird Garuda, who carries the Lord everywhere, are two divisions of the
Sama Veda known as brhat and rathantara. Garuda works as the carrier of


--- Page 163 ---
Text 35] Conversation Between Manu and Kardama 841
the Lord; therefore he is considered the transcendental prince of all carriers.
With his two wings Garuda began to vibrate the Sama Veda, which is
chanted by great sages to pacify the Lord. The Lord is worshiped by
Brahma, by Lord Siva, by Garuda and other demigods with selected poems,
and great sages worship Him with the hymns of Vedic literatures, such as
the Upanisads and Sama Veda. These Sama Veda utterances are automati-
cally heard by the devotee when another great devotee of the Lord,
Garuda, flaps his wings.

It is clearly stated here that the sage Kardama Muni began to look to the
path by which the Lord was being carried to Vaikuntha. It is thus con-
firmed that the Lord descends from His abode, Vaikuntha, in the spiritual
sky, and is carried by Garuda. The path which leads to Vaikuntha is not
worshiped by the ordinary class of transcendentalists. Only those who are
already liberated from material bondage can become devotees of the Lord.
Those who are not liberated from material bondage cannot understand
transcendental devotional service. In Bhagavad-gita it is clearly stated,
yatatam api siddhanam. There are many persons who are trying to attain
perfection by striving for liberation from material bondage, and those
who are actually liberated are called brahma-bhitita or siddha. Only the
siddhas, or persons liberated from material bondage, can become devotees.
This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita: anyone who is engaged in Krsna
consciousness or devotional service is already liberated from the influence
of the modes of material nature. Here it is also confirmed that the path of
devotional service is worshiped by liberated persons, not the conditioned
souls. The conditioned soul cannot understand the devotional service of
the Lord. Kardama Muni was a liberated soul who saw the Supreme Lord
in person, face to face. There was no doubt that he was liberated, and
thus he could see Garuda carrying the Lord on the way to Vaikuntha and
hear the flapping of his wings vibrating the sound of Hare Krsna, the
essence of the Sama Veda.

TRANSLATION
The holy Lake Bindu-sarovara, flooded by the waters of the River
Sarasvati, was resorted to by hosts of eminent sages. Its holy water was
not only auspicious but as sweet as nectar. It was called Bindu-sarovara
because drops of tears had fallen there from the eyes of the Lord, who
was overwhelmed by extreme compassion for the sage who had sought His
protection.
PURPORT
Kardama underwent austerities to gain the causeless mercy of the Lord,
and when the Lord arrived there 116 was so compassionate that in pleasure
He shed tears, which became Bindu-sarovara. Bindu-sarovara, therefore, is
worshiped by great sages and learned scholars because, according to the
philosophy of the Absolute Truth, the Lord and the tears from His eyes
are not different. Just as drops of perspiration which fell from the toe of
the Lord became the sacred Ganges, so teardrops from the transcendental
eyes of the Lord became Bindu-sarovara. Both are transcendental entities
and are worshiped by great sages and scholars. The water of Bindu-sarovara
is described here as sivamrta-jala. Siva means curing. Anyone who drinks
the water of Bindu-sarovara is cured of all material diseases; similarly,
anyone who takes his bath in the Ganges also is relieved of all material
diseases. These claims are accepted by great scholars and authorities and
are still being acted upon even in this fallen age of Kali.

TRANSLATION
The shore of the lake was surrounded by clusters of pious trees and
creepers, rich in fruits and flowers of all seasons, that afforded shelter to
pious animals and birds, which uttered various cries. It was adorned by the
beauty of groves of forest trees.
PURPORT
It is stated here that Bindu-sarovara was surrounded by pious trees and
birds. As there are different classes of men in human society, some pious
and virtuous and some impious and sinful, so also among trees and birds
there are the pious and the impious. Trees which do not bear nice fruit or
flowers are considered impious, and birds which are very nasty, such as
crows, are considered impious. In the land surrounding Bindu-sarovara
there was not a single impious bird or tree. Every tree bore fruits and flow-
ers, and every bird sang the glories of the Lord—Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna,
Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.

For most of the trees, flowers, fruits and birds mentioned here as
surrounding Bindu-sarovara Lake, English synonyms cannot be found. All
the trees mentioned are very pious in that they produce a nice aromatic
flower, such as the campaka, kadamba and bakula. The sweet sounds of
water fowl and cranes made the surrounding area as pleasant as possible
and created a very suitable spiritual atmosphere.

Its shores abounded with deer, boars, porcupines, gavayas, elephants,
baboons, lions, monkeys, mongooses and musk deer.
PURPORT
Musk deer are not found in every forest, but only in places like
Bindu-sarovara. They are always intoxicated by the aroma of musk secreted
from their navels. Gavayas, the species of cow mentioned herein, bear a
bunch of hair at the end of their tails. This bunch of hair is used in temple
worship to fan the Deities. Gavayas are sometimes called camaris, and they
are considered very sacred. In India there are still gypsies or forest mercan-
tile people who flourish by trading kastiri, or musk, and the bunches of
hair from the camaris. These are always in great demand for the higher
classes of Hindu population, and such business still goes on in large cities
and villages in India.

TRANSLATION

Entering that most sacred spot with his daughter and going near the
sage, the first monarch, Svayambhuva Manu, saw the sage sitting in his
hermitage, having just propitiated the sacred fire by pouring oblations into
it. His body shone most brilliantly; though he had engaged in austere
penance for a long time, he was not emaciated, for the Lord had cast His
affectionate sidelong glance upon him and he had also heard the nectar
flowing from the moonlike words of the Lord. The sage was tall, his eyes
were large, like the petals of a lotus, and he had matted locks on his head.
He was clad in rags. Svayambhuva Manu approached and saw him to be
somewhat soiled, like an unpolished gem.

PURPORT

11616 are some descriptions of a brahmacart yogi. In the morning, the
first duty of a brahmacdri seeking spiritual elevation 15 huta-hutdsana, to
offer sacrificial oblations to the Supreme Lord. Those engaged in
brahmacarya cannot sleep until seven or nine o’clock in the morning.
They must rise early in the morning, at least one and a half hours before
the sun rises, and offer oblations, or in this age, they must chant the
holy name of the Lord, Hare Krsna. As referred to by Lord Caitanya,
kalau nasty eva nasty eva nasty eva gatir anyatha: There is no other alterna-
tive, no other alternative, no other alternative, in this age, to chanting the
holy name of the Lord. The brahmacart must rise early in the morning and,
after placing himself, should chant the holy name of the Lord. From the
very features of the sage, it appeared that he had undergone great
austerities; that is the sign of one observing brahmacarya, the vow of
celibacy. If one lives otherwise, it will be manifest in the lust visible in his
face and body. The word vidyotamanam indicates that the brahmacart
feature showed in his body. That is the certificate that one has undergone
great austerity in yoga. A drunkard or smoker or sex-monger can never be
eligible to practice yoga. Generally yogis look very skinny because of their
not being comfortably situated, but Kardama Muni was not emaciated
because he had scen the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face.
Here the word snigdhapangavalokanat means that he was fortunate enough
to see the Supreme Lord face to face. lle looked healthy because he had
directly received the nectarean sound vibrations from the lotus lips of the


--- Page 172 ---
850 Srimad-Bhagavatam | Canto 3, Ch. 21
Personality of Godhead. Similarly, one who hears the transcendental sound
vibration of the holy name of the Lord, Hare Krsna, also improves in
health. We have actually seen that many brahmacaris and grhasthas
connected with the International Society for Krishna Consciousness have
improved in health, and a luster has come to their faces. It is essential that
a brahmacart engaged in spiritual advancement look very healthy and
lustrous. The comparison of the sage to an unpolished gem is very appro-
priate. Even if a gem just taken from a mine looks unpolished, the luster
of the gem cannot be stopped. Similarly, although Kardama was not
properly dressed and his body was not properly cleansed, his overall
appearance was gemlike.

TRANSLATION
The tour you have undertaken, O lord, is surely intended to protect the
virtuous and kill the demons, since you embody the protecting energy of
Sri Hari.
PURPORT
It appears from many Vedic literatures, especially histories like
Srimad-Bhagavatam and the Puranas, that the pious kings of old used to
tour their kingdoms in order to give protection to the pious citizens and
to chastise or kill the impious. Sometimes they used to kill animals in the


--- Page 174 ---
852 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 21
forests to practice the killing art because without such practice they would
not be able to kill the undesirable elements. Ksatriyas are allowed to
commit violence in that way because violence for a good purpose is a part
of their duty. Here two terms are clearly mentioned: vadhaya, for the
purpose of killing, and asatam, those who are undesirable. The protecting
energy of the king is supposed to be the energy of the Supreme Lord. In
Bhagavad-gita (Bg. 4.8) the Lord says, paritranaya sadhiinam vinasaya ca
duskrtam. The Lord descends to give protection to the pious and to kill
the demons. The potency, therefore, to give protection to the pious and
kill the demons or undesirables is directly an energy from the Supreme
Lord, and the king or the chief executive of the state is supposed to possess
such energy. In this age it is very difficult to find such a head of state who
is expert in killing the undesirables. Modern heads of state sit very nicely
in their palaces and try without reason to kill innocent persons.

Texts 52-54] Conversation Between Manu and Kardama 853
PURPORT
Since sage Kardama was a brahmapa and Svayambhuva was a ksatriya,
the sage was not supposed to offer obeisances to the King because socially
his position was greater than the King’s. But he offered his obeisances to
Svayambhuva Manu because as Manu, King and Emperor, he was the repre-
sentative of the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord is always worshipable,
regardless of whether one is a brahmapa, a ksatriya or a 80070. As the
representative of the Supreme Lord, the King deserved respectful obei-
sances from everyone.

If you did not mount your victorious jeweled chariot, whose mere

twanging of your bow, and if you did not roam about the world like the
brilliant sun, leading a huge army whose trampling feet cause the globe of
the earth to tremble, then all the moral laws governing the varnas and
asramas created by the Lord Himself would be broken by the rogues and
rascals.

PURPORT

It is the duty of a responsible king to protect the social and spiritual
orders in human society. The spiritual orders are divided into four
asramas—brahmacarya, grhastha, vanaprastha and sannyasa—and the social
orders, according to work and qualification, are made up of the brahmanas,
the ksatriyas, the vaifyas and the sudras. These social orders, according
to different grades of work and qualification, are described in Bhagavad-
gita. Unfortunately, for want of proper protection by responsible kings,
the system of social and spiritual orders has now become a hereditary
caste system. But this is not the actual system. Human society means that
society which is making progress toward spiritual realization. The most
advanced human society was known as arya; arya refers to those who are
advancing. So the question is, “Which society is advancing?” Advancement
does not mean creating material *‘necessities’ unnecessarily and thus wast-
ing human energy in aggravation over so-called material comforts. Real
advancement is advancement towards spiritual realization, and the com-
munity which acted towards this end was known as the Aryan civilization.
The intelligent men, the brahmanas, as exemplified by Kardama Muni, were
engaged in advancing the spiritual cause, and ksatriyas like Emperor
Svayambhuva used to rule the country and insure that all facilities for
spiritual realization were nicely provided. It is the duty of the king to
travel all over the country and see that everything is in order. Indian

civilization on the basis of the four varnas and asramas deteriorated because
of her dependency on foreigners, or those who did not follow the civili-
zation of varnasrama. Thus the varnasrama system has now been degraded
into the caste system.

The institution of fourvarnas and four asramas is confirmed herewith to
be bhagavad-racita, which means designed by the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. In Bhagavad-gita this is also confirmed: catur-varnpyarn maya
srstam. The Lord says that the institution of four varnas and four asramas
“is created by Me.” Anything created by the Lord cannot be closed or
covered. The divisions of varnas and asramas will continue to exist, either
in their original form or in degraded form, but because they are created by
the Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they cannot be extin-
guished. They are like the sun, a creation of God, and therefore will remain.
Either covered by clouds or in a clear sky, the sun will continue to exist.
Similarly, when the varnasrama system becomes degraded, it appears as a
hereditary caste system, but in every society there is an intelligent class of
men, a martial class, a mercantile class and a laborer class. When they are
regulated for cooperation among communities according to the Vedic
principles, then there is peace and spiritual advancement. But when there
is hatred and malpractice and mutual mistrust in the caste system, the
whole system becomes degraded, and, as stated herein, it creates a deplor-
able state. At the present moment, the entire world is in this deplorable
condition because of giving rights to so many interests. This is due to the
degradation of the four castes of varnas and asramas.

TRANSLATION
If you gave up all thought of the world’s situation, unrighteousness
would flourish, for men who hanker only after money would be unop-
posed. Such miscreants would attack, and the world would perish.
PURPORT
Because the scientific division of four varpas and four asramas is now
being extinguished, the entire world is being governed by unwanted men
who have no training in religion, politics or social order, and it is in a very
deplorable condition. In the institution of four varnpas and four asramas
there are regular training principles for the different classes of men. Just as,
in the modern age, there is a necessity for engineers, medical practitioners
and electricians and they are properly trained.in different scientific insti-
tutions, similarly, in former times, the higher social orders, namely the
intelligent class (the brahmanas), the ruling class (the ksatriyas), and the
mercantile class (the vaisyas), were properly trained. Bhagavad-gita describes
the duties of the brahmanas, ksatriyas, vaisyas and ऽद्वा. When there is no
such training, one simply claims that because he is born in a brahmana or
ksatriya family, he is therefore a brahmana or a ksatriya, even though he
performs the duties of a sudra. Such undue claims to being a higher caste
man make the system of scientific social orders into a caste system, com-
pletely degrading the original system. Thus society is now in chaos, and
there is neither peace nor prosperity. It is clearly stated herein that unless
there is the vigilance of a strong king, impious, unqualified men will claim
a certain status in society, and that will make the social order perish.

TRANSLATION

In spite of all this, I ask you, O valiant King, the purpose for which you
have come here. Whatever it may be, we shall carry it out without
reservation.

PURPORT

When a guest comes to a friend’s house, it is understood that there is
some special purpose. Kardama Muni could understand that such a great
king as Svayambhuva, although traveling to inspect the condition of his
kingdom, must nevertheless have had some special purpose to come to his
hermitage. Thus he prepared himself to fulfill the King’s desire. Formerly
it was customary that the sages used to go to the kings and the kings used to
visit the sages in their hermitages; each was glad to fulfill the other’s
purpose. This reciprocal relationship is called bhakti-karya. There is a nice
verse describing the relationship of mutual beneficial interest between the
brahmana and the ksatriya (ksatram dvijatvam). Ksatram means the royal
order, and dvijatvam means the brahminical order. The two were meant for
mutual interest. The royal order would give protection to the brahmanas
for the cultivation of spiritual advancement in society, and the brahmanas
would give their valuable instruction to the royal order on how the state
and the citizens can gradually be elevated in spiritual perfection.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Third Canto, Twenty-first
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “Conversation Between Manu
and Kardama.”

TRANSLATION

Manu replied: To expand himself in Vedic knowledge, Lord Brahma,
the personified Veda, from his face created you, the brahmanas, who are
full of austerity, knowledge and mystic power and are averse to sense
gratification.

PURPORT

The purpose of the Vedas is to propagate the transcendental knowledge
of the Absolute Truth. The brahmanas were created from the mouth of
the Supreme Person, and therefore they are meant to spread the knowledge
of the Vedas in order to spread the glories of the Lord. In Bhagavad-gita
also Lord Krsna says that all the Vedas are meant for understanding the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is especially mentioned here (yoga-
yuktan alampatan) that brahmanas are full of mystic power and are
completely averse to sense gratification. Actually there are two kinds of
occupations. One occupation, in the material world, is sense gratification,
and the other occupation is spiritual activity—to satisfy the Lord by His
glorification. Those who engage in sense gratification are called demons,
and those who spread the glorification of the Lord or satisfy the transcen-
dental senses of the Lord are called demigods. It is specifically mentioned
here that the brahmapas are created from the face of the cosmic
personality or virata-purusa; similarly the ksatriyas are said to be created
from His arms, the vaisyas are created from His waist, and the sudras are
created from His legs. Brahmanas are especially meant for austerity,
learning and knowledge and are averse to all kinds of sense gratification.

TRANSLATION
For the protection of the brahmanas, the thousand-legged Supreme Being
created us, the ksatriyas, from His thousand arms. Hence the brahmanas
are said to be His heart and the ksatriyas His arms.
PURPORT
Ksatriyas are specifically meant to maintain the brahmanas because if
the brahmanas are protected, then the head of civilization is protected.
Brahmanas are supposed to be the head of the social body; if the head is
clear and has not gone mad, then everything is in proper position. The
Lord is described thus: namo brahmanya-devaya go-brahmana-hitaya ca.
The purport of this prayer is that the Lord specifically protects the
brahmanas and the cows, and then He protects all other members of
society (jagat-hitaya). It is His will that universal welfare work depends on
the protection of cows and brahmanas; thus brahminical culture and cow
protection are the basic principles for human civilization. Ksatriyas
are especially meant to protect the brahmanas, as is the supreme will of
the Lord: go-brahmana-hitaya ca. As, within the body, the heart is a very
important part, so the brahmanas are also the important element in human
society. The ksatriyas are more like the whole body; even though the
whole body is bigger than the heart, the heart is more important.

TRANSLATION

That is why the brahmanas and ksatriyas protect each other, as well as
themselves; and the Lord Himself, who is both the cause and effect and is
yet immutable, protects them through each other.

ह PURPORT

The entire social structure of varna and asrama is a cooperative system
meant to uplift all to the highest platform of spiritual realization. The
brahmanas are intended to be protected by the ksatriyas, and the ksatriyas
also are intended to be enlightened by the brahmanas. When the brahmanas
and ksatriyas cooperate nicely, the other subordinate divisions, the vaisyas,
or mercantile people, and the Siidras, or laborer class, automatically
flourish. The entire elaborate system of Vedic society was therefore based
on the importance of the brahmanas and ksatriyas. The Lord is the real
protector, but He is unattached to the affairs of protection. He creates
brahmanas for the protection of the ksatriyas, and ksatriyas are created
for the protection of the brahmanas. He remains aloof from all activities;
therefore, He is called nirvikara, without activity. He has nothing to do.
He is so great that He does not perform action personally, but His energies
act. The brahmanas and ksatriyas, and anything that we see, are different
energies acting upon one another.

Although individual souls are all different, the Superself or Supersoul is
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Individually one’s self may differ
from others in certain qualities and may engage in different activities, such
as those of a brahmana, ksatriya or vaisya, but when there is complete
cooperation among different individual souls, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead as Supersoul, Paramatma, being one in every individual soul, is
pleased and gives them all protection. As stated before, the brahmanas are
produced from the mouth of the Lord, and the ksatriyas are produced
from the chest or arms of the Lord. If the different castes or social sections,
although apparently differently occupied in different activities, neverthe-
less act in full cooperation, then the Lord is pleased. This is the idea of the


--- Page 184 ---
Text 5] The Marriage of Kardama Muni and Devahuti 863
institution of four varpas and four asramas. If the members of different
asramas and varnas cooperate fully in Krsna consciousness, then society is
well protected by the Lord, without doubt.

In Bhagavad-gita it is stated that the Lord is the proprietor of all
different bodies. The individual soul is the proprietor of his individual body,
but the Lord clearly states, “My dear Bharata, you must know that I am
also ksetra-jiia.”” Ksetra-jiia means the knower or proprietor of the body.
The individual soul is the proprietor of the individual body, but the Super-
soul, the Personality of Godhead, Krsna, is the proprietor of all bodies every-
where. He is the proprietor not only of human bodies, but of birds, beasts
and all other entities, not only on this planet but on other planets also. He
is the supreme proprietor; therefore He does not become divided by
protecting the different individual souls. He remains one and the same.
That the sun appears on top of everyone’s head when at the meridian does
not imply that the sun becomes divided. One man thinks that the sun is
on his head only, whereas 5,000 miles away another man is thinking that
the sun is only on his head. Similarly, the Supersoul, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, is one, but He appears to individually oversee
each individual soul. This does not mean that the individual soul and the
Supersoul are one. They are one in quality, as spirit soul, but the
individual soul and Supersoul are different.

864 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 22
PURPORT

Manu described herewith the result of seeing a great saintly person.
Lord Caitanya says that one should always try to associate with saintly
persons because if one establishes a proper association with a saintly
person, even for a moment, he attains all perfection. Somehow or other,
if one meets a saintly person and achieves his favor, then the entire mission
of his human life is fulfilled. In our personal experience we have actual
proof of this statement of Manu. Once we had the opportunity to meet
Visnupada Sri Srimad Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami Maharaja, and
on first sight he requested this humble self to preach his message in the
Western countries. There was no preparation for this, but somehow or
other he desired it, and by his grace we are now engaged in executing his
order, which has given us a transcendental occupation and has saved and
liberated us from the occupation of material activities. Thus it is actually a
fact that if one meets a saintly person completely engaged in transcendental
duties and achieves his favor, then one’s life mission becomes complete.
What is not possible to achieve in thousands of lives can be achieved in one
moment if there is an opportunity to meet a saintly person. It is therefore
enjoined in Vedic literature that one should always try to associate with
saintly persons and try to disassociate oneself from the common man
because by one word of a saintly person one can be liberated from material
entanglement. A saintly person has the power, because of his spiritual
advancement, to give immediate liberation to the conditioned soul. Here
Manu admits that all his doubts are now over because Kardama has very
kindly described the different duties of individual souls.

TRANSLATION

It is my good fortune that I have been able to see you because you can-
not easily be seen by persons who have not subdued the mind or controlled
the senses. I am all the more fortunate to have touched with my head the
blessed dust of your feet.

PURPORT

The perfection of transcendental life can be achieved simply by touching
the holy dust of the lotus feet of a holy man. In the Bhagavatam it is said,
mahat-pada-rajo ‘bhisekam, which means to be blessed by the holy dust
of the lotus feet of a mahat, a great devotee. As stated in Bhagavad-gita,
mahatmanas tu: Those who are great souls are under the spell of spiritual
energy, and their symptom is that they fully engage in Krsna consciousness
for the service of the Lord. Therefore they are called mahat. Unless one is
fortunate enough to have the dust of the lotus feet of a mahatma on his
head, there is no possiblity of perfection in spiritual life.

The parampara system of disciplic succession is very important as a
means of spiritual success. One becomes a mahat by the grace of his mahat
spiritual master. If one takes shelter of the lotus feet of a great soul, there
is every possibility of his also becoming a great soul. When Maharaja
Rahiigana asked Jada Bharata about his wonderful achievement of spiritual
success, he replied to the King that spiritual success is not possible simply by
following the rituals of religion or simply by converting oneself into a
sannyasi or offering sacrifices as recommended in the scriptures. These
methods are undoubtedly helpful for spiritual realization, but the real
effect is brought about by the grace of a mahatma. In Visvanatha
Cakravarti Thakura’s eight stanzas of prayer to the spiritual master, it is
clearly stated that simply by satisfying the spiritual master one can
achieve the supreme success in life, and in spite of executing all ritualistic
performances, if one cannot satisfy the spiritual master, he has no access
to spiritual perfection. Here the word akrtatmanam is very significant.
Atmd means body, soul, or mind, and akrtitma means the common
man, who cannot control the senses or the mind. Because the common
man is unable to control the senses and the mind, it is therefore his duty
to seek the shelter of a great soul or a great devotee of the Lord and just
try to please him. That will make his life perfect. A common man cannot


--- Page 187 ---
866 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 22
rise to the topmost stage of spiritual perfection simply by following the
rituals and religious principles. He has to take shelter of a bona fide
spiritual master and work under his direction faithfully and sincerely;
then he becomes perfect, without a doubt.

TRANSLATION 3

I have fortunately been instructed by you, and thus great favor has been
bestowed upon me. I thank God that Thave listened with open ears to your
pure words.

PURPORT

Srila Riipa Gosvami has given directions, in his Bhakti-rasamyta-sindhu,
on how to accept a bona fide spiritual master and how to deal with him.
First, the desiring candidate must find a bona fide spiritual master, and
then he must very eagerly receive instructions from him and execute them.
This is reciprocal service. A bona fide spiritual master or saintly person
always desires to elevate a common man who comes to him. Because
everyone is under the delusion of maya and is forgetful of his prime duty,
Krsna consciousness, a saintly person always desires that everyone become
a saintly person. It is the function of a saintly person to invoke Krsna
consciousness in every forgetful common man.

Manu said that since he was advised and instructed by Kardama Muni,
he was very much favored. He considered himself lucky to receive the
message by aural reception. It is especially mentioned here that one should
be very inquisitive to hear with open ears from the authorized source of


--- Page 188 ---
Text 7] The Marriage of Kardama Muni and Devahiiti 867
the bona fide spiritual master. How is one to receive? One should receive
the transcendental message by aural reception. The word karpae-randhraih
means through the holes of the ears. The favor of the spiritual master is
not received through any other part of the body but the ears. This does
not mean, however, that the spiritual master gives a particular type of
mantra through the ears in exchange for some dollars and if the man
meditates on that then he achieves perfection and becomes God within six
months. Such reception through the ears is bogus. The real fact is that a
bona fide spiritual master knows the nature of a particular man and what
sort of duties he can perform in Krsna consciousness, and he instructs him
in that way. He instructs him through the ear, not privately, but publicly.
“You are fit for such and such work in Krsna consciousness. You can act
in this way.” One person is advised to act in Krsna consciousness by
working in the Deities’ room, another is advised to act in Krsna conscious-
ness by performing editorial work, another is advised to do preaching
work, and another is advised to carry out Krsna consciousness in the
cooking department. There are different departments of activity in Krsna
consciousness, and a spiritual master, knowing the particular ability of a
particular man, trains him in such a way that by his tendency to act he
becomes perfect. Bhagavad-gita makes it clear that one can attain the
highest perfection of spiritual life simply by offering service according to
his ability, just as Arjuna served Krsna by his ability in the military art.
Arjuna offered his service fully as a military man, and he became perfect.
Similarly, an artist can attain perfection simply by performing artistic
work under the direction of the spiritual master. If one is a literary man,
he can write articles and poetry for the service of the Lord under the
direction of the spiritual master. One has to receive the message of the
spiritual master regarding how to act in one’s capacity, for the spiritual
master is expert in giving such instructions.

This combination, the instruction of the spiritual master and the faith-
ful execution of the instruction by the disciple, makes the entire process
perfect. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura describes in his explanation of
the verse in Bhagavad-gita, vyavasayatmika buddhih, that one who wants
to be certain to achieve spiritual success must take the instruction from
the spiritual master as to what his particular function is. He should faith-
fully try to execute that particular instruction and should consider that his
life and soul. The faithful execution of the instruction which he receives
from the spiritual master is the only duty of a disciple, and that will bring
him perfection. One should be very careful to receive the message from the
spiritual master through the ears and execute it faithfully. That will make
one’s life successful.

PURPORT
When a disciple is perfectly in consonance with the spiritual master,
having received his message and executed it perfectly and sincerely, he has
a right to ask a particular favor from the spiritual master. Generally a pure
devotee of the Lord or a pure disciple of a bona fide spiritual master does
not ask any favor either from the Lord or the spiritual master, but even if
there is a need to ask a favor from the spiritual master, one cannot ask that
favor without satisfying him fully. Svayambhuva Manu wanted to disclose
his mind regarding the function he wanted to execute due to affection for
his daughter.

My daughter is the sister of Priyavrata and Uttanapada. She is seeking

PURPORT
The grown-up daughter of Svayambhuva Manu, Devahiti, had good
character and was well qualified; therefore she was searching for a suitable
husband just befitting her age, qualities and character. The purpose of
Manu’s introducing his daughter as the sister of Priyavrata and Uttanapada,
two great kings, was to convince the sage that the girl came from a great
family. She was his daughter and at the same time the sister of ksatriyas;
she did not come from a lower class family. Manu therefore offered her to
Kardama as just suitable for his purpose. It is clear that although the
daughter was mature in age and qualities, she did not go out and find her
husband independently. She expressed her desire for a suitable husband
corresponding to her character, age and quality, and the father himself, out
of affection for his daughter, took charge of finding such a husband.

TRANSLATION
The moment she heard from the sage Narada of your noble character,
learning, beautiful appearance, youth and other virtues, she fixed her
mind upon you.
PURPORT
The girl Devahiiti did not personally see Kardama Muni, nor did she
personally experience his character or qualities, since there was no social
intercourse by which she could gain such understanding. But she heard
about Kardama Muni from the authority of Narada Muni. Hearing from an
authority is a better experience than gaining personal understanding. She
heard from Narada Muni that Kardama Muni was just fit to be her husband;
therefore she became fixed in her heart that she would marry him, and she
expressed her desire to her father, who therefore brought her before him.

TRANSLATION
Therefore please accept her, O chief of the brahmanas, for I offer her

your household duties.
PURPORT
The words grhamedhisu karmasu mean in household duties. Another
word is also used here: sarvatmananurupam. The purport is that a wife


--- Page 192 ---
Text 12] The Marriage of Kardama Muni and Devahati 871
should not only be equal to her husband in age, character and qualities,
but she must be helpful to him in his household duties. The household
duty of a man is not to satisfy his sense gratification, but to remain with
a wife and children and at the same time attain advancement in spiritual
life. One who does not do so is not a householder but a grhamedhi. Two
words are used in Sanskrit literature; one is grhastha, and the other is
grhamedht. The difference between grhamedhi and grhastha is that
grhastha is also an asrama, or spiritual order, but if one simply satisfies his
senses as a householder, then he is a grhamedhi. For a grhamedhi, to
accept a wife means to satisfy the senses, but for a grhastha a qualified
wife is an assistant in every respect for advancement in spiritual activities.
It is the duty of the wife to take charge of household affairs and not to
compete with the husband. A wife is meant to help, but she cannot help
her husband unless he is completely equal to her in age, character and
quality.

not refuse to accept it. Kardama Muni was not meant for sense gratifica-
tion, yet he aspired to marry and prayed to the Lord for a suitable wife.
This was known to Svayambhuva Manu. He indirectly convinced Kardama
Muni: “Y ou desire a suitable wife like my daughter, and she is now present
before you. You should not reject the fulfillment of your prayer; you
should accept my daughter.”

TRANSLATION

One who rejects an offering that comes of its own accord but later begs
a boon from a miser thus loses his widespread reputation, and his pride is
humbled by the neglectful behavior of others.

PURPORT

The general procedure of Vedic marriage is that a father offers his
daughter to a suitable boy. That is a very respectable marriage. A boy
should not go to the girl's father and ask for the hand of his daughter in
marriage. That is considered to be humbling one’s respectable position.
Svayambhuva Manu wanted to convince Kardama Muni, since he knew
that the sage wanted to marry a suitable girl: “I am offering just such a
suitable wife. Do not reject the offer, or else, because you are in need of a
wife, you will have to ask for such a wife from someone else, who may not
behave with you so well. In that case your position will be humbled.”

Another feature of this incident is that Svayambhuva Manu was the
Emperor, but he went to offer his qualified daughter to a poor brahmana.

Text 14] The Marriage of Kardama Muni and Devahati 873
Kardama Muni had no worldly possessions—he was a hermit living in the
forest—but he was advanced in culture. Therefore, in offering one’s
daughter to a person, the culture and quality are counted as prominent,
not wealth or any other material consideration.

TRANSLATION

Svayambhuva Manu continued: O wise man, I heard that you were pre-
pared to marry. Please accept her hand, which is being offered to you by
me, since you have not taken a vow of perpetual celibacy.

PURPORT

The principle of brahmacarya is celibacy. There are two kinds of
brahmacaris. One is called naisthika-brahmacari, which means one who
takes a vow of celibacy for his wholelife, whereas the other, the upakurvana-
brahmacari, is a brahmacari who takes the vow of celibacy up to a certain
age. For example, he may take the vow to remain celibate up to twenty-
five years of age;then, with the permission of his spiritual master, he enters
married life. Brahmacarya is student life, the beginning of life in the
spiritual orders, and the principle of brahmacarya is celibacy. Only a
householder can indulge in sense gratification or sex life, not a brahmacari.
Svayambhuva Manu requested Kardama Muni to accept his daughter,
since Kardama had not taken the vow of naisthika-brahmacarya. He was
willing to marry, and the suitable daughter of a high royal family was
presented.

TRANSLATION
The great sage replied: Certainly I have a desire to marry, and your
daughter has not yet married or given her word to anyone. Therefore our
marriage according to the Vedic system can take place.
PURPORT
There were many considerations by Kardama Muni before accepting
the daughter of Svayambhuva Manu. Most important is that Devahati had
first of all fixed her mind on marrying him. She did not choose to have any
other man as her husband. That is a great consideration because female
psychology dictates that when a woman offers her heart to a man for the
first time, it is very difficult for her to take it back. Also, she had not
married before; she was a virgin girl. All these considerations convinced
Kardama Muni to accept her. Therefore he said, “Yes, I shall accept your
daughter under religious regulations of marriage.” There are different kinds
of marriages, of which the first-class marriage is held by inviting a suitable
bridegroom for the daughter and giving her in charity, well dressed and
well decorated with ornaments, along with a dowry according to the
means of the father. There are other kinds of marriage, such as gandharva
marriage and marriage by love, which are also accepted as marriage. Even


--- Page 196 ---
Text 16] The Marriage of Kardama Muni and Devahati 875
if one is forcibly kidnapped and later on accepted as a wife, that is also
accepted. But Kardama Muni accepted the first-class way of marriage
because the father was willing and the daughter was qualified. She had
never offered her heart to anyone else. All these considerations made
Kardama Muni agree to accept the daughter of Svayambhuva Manu.

TRANSLATION
Let your daughter’s desire for marriage, which is recognized in the Vedic
scriptures, be fulfilled. Who would not accept her hand? She is so beautiful
that by her bodily luster alone she excels the beauty of her ornaments.
PURPORT
Kardama Muni wanted to marry Devahiiti in the recognized manner of
marriage prescribed in the scriptures. As stated in the Vedic scriptures, the
first-class process is to call the bridegroom to the home of the bride and
hand her to him in charity with a dowry of necessary ornaments, gold,
furniture and other household paraphernalia. This form of marriage is
prevalent among higher class Hindus even today and is declared in the
sastras to confer great religious merit on the bride’s father. To give a


--- Page 197 ---
876 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 22
daughter in charity to a suitable son-in-law is considered to be one of the
pious activities of a householder. There are eight forms of marriage men-
tioned in the scripture Manu-smrti, but only one process of marriage,
brahma or rajasika marriage, is now current. Other kinds of marriage, by
love, by exchange of garlands or by kidnapping the bride, are now for-
bidden in this Kali Age. Formerly, ksatriyas would, at their pleasure,
kidnap a princess from another royal house, and there would be a fight
between the ksatriya and the girl's family; then, if the kidnapper was the
winner, the girl would be offered to him for marriage. Even Krsna married
Rukmini by that process, and some of His sons and grandsons also married
by kidnapping. Krsna’s grandson kidnapped Duryodhana’s daughter, which
caused a fight between the Kuru and Yadu families. Afterwards, an
adjustment was made by the elderly members of the Kuru family. Such
marriages were current in bygone ages, but at the present moment they
are not possiblebecause the strict principles of ksatriyalife have practically
been abolished. Since India has become dependent on foreign countries,
the particularinfluences of her social orders have been lost; now, according
to the scriptures, everyone is a Sidra. The so-called brahmanas, ksatriyas
and vaisyas have forgotten their traditional activities, and in the absence of
these activities they are called sudras. It is said in the scriptures, kalau
§itdra- sambhava. In the age of Kali everyone will be like $iidras. The
traditional social customs are not followed in this age, although formerly
they were followed strictly.

I have heard that Viévavasu, the great Gandharva, his mind stupefied
with infatuation, fell from his airplane after seeing your daughter playing
with a ball on the roof of the palace, for she was indeed beautiful with her
tinkling ankle bells and her eyes moving to and fro.
PURPORT
It is understood that not only at the present moment but in those days
also there were skyscrapers. Herein we find the word harmya-prsthe.
Harmya means a very big palatial building. Svad vimanad means “from his
own airplane.” It is suggested that private airplanes or helicopters were also
current in those days. The Gandharva Vidvavasu, while flying in the sky,
could see Devahuti playing ball on the roof of the palace. Ball playing was
also current, but aristocratic girls would not play in a public place. Ball
playing and other such pleasures were not meant for ordinary women and
girls; only princesses like Devahiiti could indulge in such sports. It is
described here that she was seen from the flying airplane. This indicates
that the palace was very high, otherwise how could one see her from an
airplane? The vision was so distinct that the Gandharva Viévavasu was
bewildered by her beauty and by hearing the sound of her ankle bangles,
and, being captivated by the sound and beauty, he fell down. Kardama
Muni mentioned the incident as he had heard it.

What wise man would not welcome her, the very ornament of woman-
hood, the beloved daughter of Svayambhuva Manu and sister of Uttana-
pada? Those who have not worshiped the gracious feet of the goddess of
fortune cannot even perceive her, yet she has come of her own accord to
seek my hand.

PURPORT

Kardama Muni praised the beauty and qualification of Devahuti in
different ways. Devahuti was actually the ornament of all ornamented
beautiful girls. A girl becomes beautiful by putting ornaments on her
body, but Devahuti was more beautiful than the ornaments; she was
considered the ornament of the ornamented beautiful girls. Demigods
and Gandharvas were attracted by her beauty. Kardama Muni, although a
great sage, was not a denizen of the heavenly planets, but it is mentioned
in the previous verse that Visvavasu, who came from heaven, was also
attracted by the beauty of Devahiiti. Besides her personal beauty, she
was the daughter of Emperor Svayambhuva and sister of King Uttanapada.
Who could refuse the hand of such a girl?

Therefore I shall accept this chaste girl as my wife, on the condition
that after she bears semina from my body, I shall accept the life of devo-
tional service accepted by the most perfect human beings. That process
was described by Lord Visnu. It is free from envy.

PURPORT

Kardama Muni expressed his desire for a very beautiful wife to Emperor
Svayambhuva, and he accepted his daughter for marriage. He was in the
hermitage practicing complete celibacy as a brahmacari, and although he
had the desire to marry, he did not want to be a householder for the whole
span of his life because he was conversant with the Vedic principles of
human life. According to Vedic principles, the first part of life should be
utilized in brahmacarya for the development of character and spiritual
qualities. In the next part of life, one may accept a wife and beget
children, but one should not beget children like cats and dogs.

Kardama Muni desired to beget a child who would be a ray of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. One should beget a child who can
perform the duties of Visnu, otherwise there is no need to produce
children. There are two kinds of children born of good fathers: one is
educated in Krsna consciousness so that he can be delivered from the
clutches of maya in that very life, and the other is a ray of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead and teaches the world the ultimate goal
of life. As will be described in later chapters, Kardama Muni begot such a
child—Kapila, the incarnation of the Personality of Godhead who enun-
ciated the philosophy of sankhya. Great householders pray to God to
send His representative so that there may be an auspicious movement
in human society. This is one reason to beget a child. Another reason is
that a highly enlightened parent can train a child in Krsna consciousness
so that the child will not have to come back again to this miserable world.
Parents should see to it that the child born of them does not enter the
womb of a mother again. Unless one can train a child for liberation in that


--- Page 201 ---
880 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 22
life, there is no need to marry or produce children. If human society
produces children like cats and dogs for the disturbance of social order,
then the world becomes hellish, as it has in this age of Kali. In this age,
neither parents nor their children are trained; both are animalistic and
simply eat, sleep, mate, defend and gratify their senses. This disorder
in social life cannot bring peace to human society. Kardama Muni explains
beforehand that he would not associate with the girl Devahiiti for the
whole duration of his life. He would simply associate with her until she
had a child. In other words, sex life should be utilized only to produce a
nice child, not for any other purpose. Human life is especially meant for
complete devotion to the service of the Lord. That is the philosophy of
Lord Caitanya.

After fulfilling his responsibility to produce a nice child, one should
take sannyasa and engage in the perfectional paramaharisa stage. Parama-
hamsa refers to the most highly elevated perfectional stage of life. There
are four stages within sannyasa life, and paramahamsa is the highest order.
The Srimad-Bhagavatam is called the Paramahamsa-samhita, the treatise
for the highest class of human beings. The paramahariisa is free from envy.
In other stages, even in the householder stage of life, there is competition
and envy, but since the activities of the human being in the paramaharisa
stage are completely engaged in Krsna consciousness or devotional service,
there is no scope for envy. In the same order as Kardama Muni, about 100
years ago, Thakura Bhaktivinoda also wanted to beget a child who could
preach the philosophy and teaching of Lord Caitanya to the fullest extent.
By his prayers to the Lord he had as his child Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati
Gosvami Maharaja, who at the present moment is preaching the philosophy
of Lord Caitanya throughout the entire world through his bona fide
disciples.

TRANSLATION

The highest authority for me is the unlimited Supreme Personality of
Godhead, from whom this wonderful creation emanates and in whom its
sustenance and dissolution rest. He is the origin of all prajapatis, the per-
sonalities meant to produce living entities in this world.

PURPORT

Kardama Muni was ordered by his father, Prajapati, to produce children.
In the beginning of creation the prajapatis were meant to produce the
large population which was to reside in the planets of the gigantic
universe. But Kardama Muni said that although his father was Prajapati,
who desired him to produce children, actually his origin was the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Visnu, because Visnu is the origin of everything;
He is the actual creator of this universe, He is the actual maintainer, and
when everything is annihilated, it rests in Him only. That is the conclusion
of Srimad-Bhagavatam. For creation, maintenance and annihilation there
are the three deities Brahma, Visnu and Mahesvara (Siva), but Brahma and
Mahesvara are qualitative expansions of Visnu. Vignu is the central figure.
Visnu, therefore, takes charge of maintenance. No one can maintain the
whole creation but Him. There are innumerable entities, and they have
innumerable demands; no one but Visnu can fulfill the innumerable de-
mands of all the innumerable living entities. Brahma is ordered to create,
and Siva is ordered to annihilate. The middle function, maintenance,
is taken charge of by Visnu. Kardama Muni knew very well, by his
power in progressive spiritual life, that "15100, the Personality of God-
head, was his worshipable Deity. Whatever Visnu desired was his duty,
and nothing else. He was not prepared to beget a number of children. He
would beget only one child, who would help the mission of Visnu. As
stated in Bhagavad-gita, whenever there is a discrepancy in the discharge
of religious principles, the Lord descends on the surface of the earth to
protect religious principles and to annihilate the miscreants.

Marrying and begetting a child is considered to liquidate one’s debts to
the family in which one is born. There are many debts which are imposed


--- Page 203 ---
882 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 22
upon a child just after his birth. There are debts to the family in which one
is born, debts to the demigods, debts to the pitas, debts to the rsis, etc.
But if someone engages only in the service of the Supreme Lord, the
Personality of Godhead, who is actually worshipable, then even without
trying to liquidate other debts, one becomes free from all obligations.
Kardama Muni preferred to devote his life as a servant of the Lord in
paramaharisa knowledge and to beget a child only for that purpose, not
to beget numberless children to fill up the vacancies in the universe.

PURPORT
It appears that Kardama Muni was fully absorbed in Krsna consciousness
because as soon as he became silent, he at once began to think of Lord

Text 23] The Marriage of Kardama Muni and Devahiti 883
Vigpu. That is the way of Krsna consciousness. Pure devotees are so
absorbed in thought of Krsna that they have no other engagement;
although they may seem to think or act otherwise, they are always
thinking of Krsna. The smile of such a Krsna conscious person is so
attractive that simply by smiling he wins so many admirers, disciples and
followers.

TRANSLATION

Empress Satartipa lovingly gave most valuable presents, suitable for the
occasion, such as jewelry, clothes and household articles, in dowry to the
bride and bridegroom.

PURPORT

The custom of giving one’s daughter in charity with a dowry is still
current in India. The gifts are given according to the position of the father
of the bride. Paribarhan maha-dhanan means the dowry which must be
awarded to the bridegroom at the time of marriage. Here maha-dhanan
means greatly valuable gifts befitting the dowry of an empress. The words
bhisa-vasah paricchadan also appear here. Bhizsa means ornaments, vasah
means clothing, and paricchadan means various household articles. All
things befitting the marriage ceremony of an emperor’s daughter were
awarded to Kardama Muni, who was until now observing celibacy as a
brahmacari. The bride, Devahiiti, was very richly dressed with ornaments
and clothing.

In this way Kardama Muni was married with full opulence to a qualified
wife and was endowed with the necessary paraphernalia for household life.
In the Vedic way of marriage such a dowry is still given to the bridegroom
by the father of the bride; even in poverty-stricken India there are
marriages where hundreds and thousands of rupees are spent for a dowry.
The dowry system is not illegal, as some have tried to prove. The dowry is
a gift given to the daughter by the father to show good will, and it is
compulsory. In rare cases where the father is completely unable to give a
dowry, it is enjoined that he must at least give a fruit and a flower. As
stated in Bhagavad-gita, God can also be pleased even by a fruit and a
flower. When there is financial inability and no question of accumulating
a dowry by another means, one can give a fruit and flower for the
satisfaction of the bridegroom.

PURPORT
A father always remains in anxiety until he can hand over his grown-up
daughter to a suitable boy. A father and mother’s responsibility for
children continues until they marry them to suitable spouses; when the
father is able to perform that duty, he is relieved of his responsibility.

--- Page 207 ---
886 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 22
PURPORT
The word amba is significant. A father sometimes addresses his daughter
in affection as “Mother” and sometimes as “my darling.” The feeling of
separation occurs because until the daughter is married she remains the
daughter of the father, but after her marriage she is no longer claimed as a
daughter in the family; she must go to the husband’s house, for after mar-
riage she becomes the property of the husband. According to Manu-samhita,
a woman is never independent. She must remain the property of the father
while she is not married, and she must remain the property of the husband
until she is elderly and has grown-up children of her own. In old age, when
the husband has taken sannyasa and left home, she remains the property
of the sons. A woman is always dependent, either upon the father, husband
or elderly sons. That will be exhibited in the life of Devahuti. Devahiiti’s
father handed over responsibility for her to the husband, Kardama Muni,
and, in the same way, Kardama Muni also left home, giving the responsi-
bility to his son, Kapiladeva. This narration will describe these events one
after another. A

After asking and obtaining the great sage’s permission to leave, the
monarch mounted his chariot with his wife and started for his capital,
followed by his retinue. Along the way he saw the prosperity of the tranquil
seers’ beautiful hermitages on both the charming banks of the Sarasvati,
the river so agreeable to saintly persons.

PURPORT

As cities are constructed in the modern age with great engineering and
architectural craftmanship, so in days gone by there were neighborhoods
called rsi-kulas where great saintly persons resided. In India there are still
many magnificant places for spiritual understanding; there are many rsis
and saintly persons living in nice cottages on the banks of the Ganges and
Yamuna for purposes of spiritual cultivation. While passing through
the rsi-kulas the King and his party were very much satisfied with the beauty
of the cottages and hermitages. It is stated here, pasyann asrama-sampadah.
The great sages had no skyscrapers, but the hermitages were so beautiful
that the King was very much pleased at the sight.

ments.
PURPORT
It is the custom of the citizens of a kingdom’s capital to receive
the king when he returns from a tour. There is a similar description when
Krsna returned to Dvaraka after the Battle of Kuruksetra. At that time
He was received by all classes of citizens at the gate of the city. Formerly,
capital cities were surrounded by walls, and there were different gates for
regular entrance. Even in Delhi today there are old gates, and some other
old cities have such gates where citizens would gather to receive the king.
Here also the citizens of Barhismati, the capital of Brahmavarta, the
kingdom of Svayambhuva, came nicely dressed to receive the Emperor
with decorations and musical instruments.

TRANSLATION

The city of Barhismati, rich in all kinds of wealth, was so called because
Lord Visnu’s hair dropped there from His body when He manifested
Himself as Lord Boar. As He shook His body, this very hair fell and turned
into blades of evergreen kusa grass and kasa [another kind of grass used
for mats], by means of which the sages worshiped Lord Visnu after
defeating the demons who had interfered with the performance of their
sacrifices.

PURPORT

Any place directly connected with the Supreme Lord is called pitha-
sthana. Barhigsmati, the capital of Svayambhuva Manu, was exalted not be-
cause the city was very rich in wealth and opulence, but because the hairs of
Lord Varaha fell at this very spot. These hairs of the Lord later grew as
green grass, and the sages used to worship the Lord with that grass after
the time when the Lord killed the demon Hiranyaksa. Yajiia means Visnu,
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Bhagavad-gita, karma is described
as yajiartha. Yajiartha-karma means work done only for the satisfaction
of Visnu. If something is done for sense gratification or any other purpose,
then it will be binding upon the worker. If one wants to be freed from the
reaction of his work, he must perform everything for the satisfaction of
Visnu, or Yajia. In the capital of Svayambhuva Manu, Barhismati, these
particular functions were being performed by the great sages and saintly
persons.

TRANSLATION

Manu spread a seat of kusas and kasas and worshiped the Lord, the
Personality of Godhead, by whose grace he had obtained the rule of the
terrestrial globe.

PURPORT

Manu is the father of mankind, and therefore from “Manu” comes the
word “man,” or, in Sanskrit, “manusya.” Those who are in a better
position in the world, having sufficient wealth, should especially take
lessons from Manu, who acknowledged his kingdom and opulence to be
gifts from the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus always engaged
in devotional service. Similarly, the descendants of Manu, or human beings,
especially those who are situated in a well-to-do condition, must consider
that whatever riches they have are gifts from the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Those riches should be utilized for the service of the Lord in
sacrifices performed to please Him. That is the way of utilizing wealth and
opulence. No one can achieve wealth, opulence, good birth, a beautiful
body or nice education without the mercy of the Supreme Lord. There-
fore, those who are in possession of such valuable facilities must acknowl-
edge their gratefulness to the Lord by worshiping Him and offering what
they have received from Him. When such acknowledgment is given, either
by a family, nation or society, their abode becomes almost like Vaikuntha,
and it becomes free from the operation of the threefold miseries of this
material world. In the modern age the mission of Krsna consciousness is
for everyone to acknowledge the supremacy of Lord Krsna; whatever one
has in his possession must be considered a gift by the grace of the Lord.
Everyone, therefore, should engage in devotional service through Krsna
consciousness. If one wants to be happy and peaceful in his position,
either as a householder or citizen or member of human society, one must
promote devotional service for the pleasure of the Lord.

TRANSLATION
Having entered the city of Barhismati, in which he had previously lived,
Manu entered his palace, which was filled with an atmosphere that eradi-
cated the three miseries of material existence.
PURPORT
The material world, or material existential life, is filled with threefold
miseries: miseries pertaining to the body and mind, miseries pertaining to
natural disturbances, and miseries inflicted by other living entities. Human
society is meant to create a spiritual atmosphere by spreading the spirit of
Krsna consciousness. The miseries of material existence cannot affect the
status of Krsna consciousness. It is not that the miseries of the material
world completely vanish when one takes to Krsna consciousness, but for
one who is Krsna conscious the miseries of material existence have no
effect. We cannot stop the miseries of the material atmosphere, but Krsna
consciousness is the antiseptic method to protect us from being affected
by the miseries of material existence. For a Krsna conscious person, both
living in heaven and living in hell are equal. How Svayambhuva Manu
created an atmosphere wherein he was not affected by material miseries is
explained in the following verses.

TRANSLATION

Emperor Svayambhuva Manu enjoyed life with his wife and subjects and
fulfilled his desires without being disturbed by unwanted principles
contrary to the process of religion. Celestial musicians and their wives
sang in chorus about the pure reputation of the Emperor, and early in the
morning, every day, he used to listen to the pastimes of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead with a loving heart.

PURPORT

Human society is actually meant for realization of perfection in Krsna
consciousness. There is no restriction against living with a wife and
children, but life should be so conducted that one may not go against the
principles of religion, economic development, regulated sense enjoyment
and, ultimately, liberation from material existence. The Vedic principles
are designed in such a way that the conditioned souls who have come to
this material existence may be guided in fulfilling their material desires
and at the same time be liberated and go back to Godhead, back home.

It is understood that Emperor Svayambhuva Manu enjoyed his house-
hold life by following these principles. It is stated here that early in the
morning there were musicians who used to sing with musical instruments
about the glories of the Lord, and the Emperor, with his family, personally
used to hear about the pastimes of the Supreme Person. This custom is still
prevalent in India in some of the royal families and temples. Professional mu-
sicians sing with shanais, and the sleeping members of the house gradually get
up from their beds in a pleasing atmosphere. During bedtime also the singers
sing songs in relationship with the pastimes of the Lord, with shanai
accompaniment, and the householders gradually fall asleep remembering
the glories of the Lord. In every house, in addition to the singing program,
there is an arrangement for Bhagavatam lectures in the evening; family


--- Page 214 ---
Text 34] The Marriage of Kardama Muni and Devahuti 893
members sit down, hold Hare Krsna kirtana, hear narrations from Srimad-
Bhagavatam and Bhagavad-gita and enjoy music before going to bed. The
atmosphere created by this sankirtana movement lives in their hearts, and
while sleeping they also dream of the singing and glorification of the Lord.
In such a way perfection of Krsna consciousness can be attained. This
practice is very old, as learned from this verse of Srimad-Bhagavatam;
millions of years ago, Svayambhuva Manu used to avail himself of this
opportunity to live householder life in the peace and prosperity of a
Krsna consciousness atmosphere.

As far as temples are concerned, in each and every royal palace or rich
man’s house, inevitably there is a nice temple, and the members of the
household rise early in the morning and go to the temple to see the
mangalaratrika ceremony. The mangalaratrika ceremony is the first wor-
ship of the morning. In the aratrika ceremony a light is offered in circles
before the Deities with a conchshell and flowers and a fan. The Lord is
supposed to rise early in the morning and take some light refreshment and
give audience to the devotees. The devotees then go back to the house or
sing the glories of the Lord in the temple. The early morning ceremony
still takes place in Indian temples and palaces. Temples are meant for the
assembly of the general public. Temples within palaces are especially for
the royal families, but in many of these palace temples the public is also
allowed to visit. The temple of the King of Jaipur is situated within the
palace, but the public is allowed to assemble; if one goes there, he will see
that the temple is always crowded with at least 500 devotees. After the
mangalaratrika ceremony they sit down together and sing the glories of
the Lord with musical instruments and thus enjoy life. Temple worship by
the royal family is also mentioned in Bhagavad-gita, where it is stated that
those who fail to achieve success in the bhakti-yoga principles within one
life are given a chance to take birth in the next life in the family of rich
men or in a royal family or family of learned brahmanas or devotees. If
anyone gets the opportunity to take birth in these families, he can achieve
the facilities of a Krsna conscious atmosphere without difficulty. A child
born in that Krsna atmosphere is sure to develop Krsna consciousness. The
perfection which he failed to attain in his last life is again offered in this
life, and he can make himself perfect without fail.

TRANSLATION

Thus Svayambhuva Manu was a saintly king. Although absorbed in
material happiness, he was not dragged to the lowest grade of life, for he
always enjoyed his material happiness in a Krgna conscious atmosphere.

PURPORT

The kingly happiness of material enjoyment generally drags one to the
lowest grade of life, namely degradation to animal life, because of un-
restricted sense enjoyment. But Svayambhuva Manu was considered as
good as a saintly sage because the atmosphere created in his kingdom and
home was completely Krsna conscious. The case is similar with the
conditioned souls in general; they have come into this material life for
sense gratification, but if they are able to create a Krsna conscious
atmosphere, as depicted here or as prescribed in revealed scriptures, by
temple worship and household Deity worship, then in spite of their
material enjoyment they can make advancement in pure Krsna conscious-
ness without a doubt. At the present moment, modern civilization is too
much attached to the material way of life, or sense gratification. There-
fore, the Krsna consciousness movement can give the people in general the
best opportunity to utilize their human life in the midst of material
enjoyment. Krsna consciousness does not stop them in their propensity
for material enjoyment, but simply regulates their habits in the life of
sense enjoyment. In spite of their enjoying the material advantages, they
can be liberated in this very life by practicing Krsna consciousness by the
simple method of chanting the holy names of the Lord—Hare Krsna, Hare
Krsna, Krgna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama,
Hare Hare.

TRANSLATION

Consequently, although his duration of life gradually came to an end,
his long life, consisting of a Manvantara Era, was not spent in vain, since he
ever engaged in hearing, contemplating, writing down and chanting the
pastimes of the Lord.

PURPORT

As freshly prepared food is very tasteful but if kept for three or four
hours becomes stale and tasteless, so the existence of material enjoyment
can endure as long as life is fresh, but at the fag end of life everything
becomes tasteless, and everything appears to be vain and painful. The life
of Emperor Svayambhuva Manu, however, was not tasteless; as he grew
older, his life remained as fresh as in the beginning because of his
continued Krsna consciousness. The life of a man in Krsna consciousness
is always fresh. It is said that the sun rises in the morning and sets in the
evening and its business is to reduce the duration of everyone's life. But
the sunrise and sunset cannot diminish the life of he who engages in
Krsna consciousness. Svayambhuva Manu’s life did not become stale after
some time because he engaged himself always in chanting about and
meditating upon Lord Visnu. He was the greatest yogi because he never
wasted his time. It is especially mentioned here, vispoh kurvato bruvatah
kathah. When he talked, he talked only of Krsna and Visnu, the Personality
of Godhead; when he heard something, it was about Krsna; when he
meditated, it was upon Krsna and His activities.

896 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 22
It is stated that his life was very long, seventy-one yugas. One yuga is
completed in 4,320,000 years, seventy-one of such yugas is the duration
of the life of a Manu, and fourteen such Manus come and go in one day of
Brahma. For the entire duration of his life—4,320,000 times 71 years—
Manu engaged in Krsna consciousness by chanting, hearing, talking about
and meditating upon Krsna. Therefore, his life was not wasted, nor did it
become stale.

TRANSLATION
He passed his time, which lasted seventy-one cycles of the four ages
[71 x 4,320,000 years], always thinking of Vasudeva and always engaged
in matters regarding Vasudeva. Thus he transcended the three destinations.
PURPORT
The three destinations are meant for persons who are under the control
of the three modes of material nature. These destinations are sometimes
described as the awakened, dreaming and unconscious stages. In Bhagavad-
gita the three destinations are described as the destinations of persons in
the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. It is stated in the Gita that
those who are in the mode of goodness are promoted to better living
conditions in higher planets and those who are in the mode of passion
remain within this material world on the earth or on heavenly planets, but
those who are in the mode of ignorance are degraded to an animal life on
planets where life is lower than human. Bul one who is Krsna conscious is


--- Page 218 ---
Text 37] The Marriage of Kardama Muni and Devahati 897
above these three modes of material nature. It is stated in Bhagavad-gita
that anyone who engages in devotional service to the Lord automatically
becomes transcendental to the three destinations of material nature and is
situated in the brahma-bhiita or self-realized stage. Although Svayambhuva
Manu, the ruler of this material world, appeared to be absorbed in material
happiness, he was neither in the mode of goodness, nor in the modes of
passion or ignorance, but in the transcendental stage.

Therefore, one who fully engages in devotional service is always lib-
erated. Bilvamangala Thakura, a great devotee of the Lord, stated: “If
I have unflinching devotion to the lotus feet of Krsna, then Mother
Liberation is always engaged in my service. Complete perfection of
material enjoyment, religion and economic development are at my com-
mand.” People are after dharma, artha, kama and moksa. Generally they
perform religious activities to achieve some material gain, and they engage
in material activity for sense gratification. After being frustrated in
material sense gratification, one wants to be liberated and become one
with the Absolute Truth. These four principles form the transcendental
path for the less intelligent. Those who are actually intelligent engage in
Krsna consciousness, not caring for these four principles of the transcen-
dental method. They at once elevate themselves to the transcendental
platform which is above liberation. Liberation is not a very great achieve-
ment for a devotee, to say nothing of the results of ritualistic performances
in religion, economic development, or the materialistic life of sense
gratification. Devotees do not care for these. They are situated always on
the transcendental platform of the brahma-bhuta stage of self-realization.

TRANSLATION
Therefore, O Vidura, how can persons completely under the shelter of
Lord Krsna in devotional service be put into miseries pertaining to the
body, the mind, nature, and other men and living creatures?
PURPORT
Every living entity within this material world is always afflicted by
some kind of miseries, pertaining either to the body, the mind, or natural
disturbances. Distresses due to cold in winter and severe heat in summer
always inflict miseries on the living entities in this material world, but one
who has completely taken shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord in Krsna
consciousness is in the transcendental stage; he is not disturbed by any
miseries, either due to the body, the mind, or natural disturbances of
summer and winter. He is transcendental to all these miseries.

TRANSLATION
Maitreya continued: After the departure of her parents, the chaste
woman Devahiiti, who could understand the desires of her husband,
served him constantly with great love, as Bhavani, the wife of Lord Siva,
serves her husband.
PURPORT
The specific example of Bhavani is very significant. Bhavani means the
wife of Bhava, or Lord Siva. Bhavani, or Parvati, the daughter of the King
of the Himalayas, selected Lord Siva, who appears to be just like a beggar,
as her husband. In spite of her being a princess, she undertook all kinds of
tribulations to associate with Lord Siva, who did not even have a house
but was sitting underneath the trees and passing his time in meditation.
901


--- Page 222 ---
902 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 23
Although Bhavani was the daughter of a very great king, she used to serve
Lord Siva just like a poor woman. Similarly, Devahiiti was the daughter of
an emperor, Svayambhuva Manu, yet she preferred to accept Kardama
Muni as her husband. She served him with great love and affection, and
she knew how to please him. Therefore, she is designated here as sadhvi,
which means a chaste, faithful wife. Her rare example is the ideal of Vedic
civilization. Every woman is expected to be as good and chaste as
Devahiiti or Bhavani. Today in Hindu society, unmarried girls are still
taught to worship Lord Siva with the idea that they may get husbands like
him. Lord Siva is the ideal husband, not in the sense of riches or sense
gratification, but because he is the greatest of all devotees. Vaispavanam
yatha sambhuh: Sambhu, or Lord Siva, is the ideal Vaispava. He constantly
meditates upon Lord Rama and chants Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama
Rama, Hare Hare. Lord Siva has 9 Vaisnava sampradaya which is called the
Vignusvami-sampradaya. Unmarried girls worship Lord Siva so that
they can expect a husband who is as good a Vaignava as he. The girls are
not taught to select a husband who is very rich or very opulent for material
sense gratification, but if a girl is fortunate enough to get a husband as
good as Lord Siva in devotional service, then her life becomes perfect. The
wife is dependent on the husband, and if the husband is a Vaignava, then
naturally she shares the devotional service of the husband because she
renders him service. This reciprocation of service and love between husband
and wife is the ideal of a householders life.

TRANSLATION

0 Vidura, Devahiiti served her husband with intimacy and great respect,
with control of the senses, with love and with sweet words.
PURPORT
Here two words are very significant. Devahuti served her husband in
two ways, viSrambhena and gauravepa. These are two important pro-
cesses in serving the husband or the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Visrambhena means with intimacy, and gauravena means with great rever-
ence. The husband is a very intimate friend; therefore, the wife must
render service just like an intimate friend, and at the same time she must
understand that the husband is superior in position, and thus she must
offer him all respect. A man’s psychology and woman’s psychology are
different. As constituted by bodily frame, a man always wants to be
superior to his wife, and a woman, as bodily constituted, is naturally
inferior to her husband. Thus the natural instinct is that the husband
wants to post himself as superior to the wife, and this must be observed.
Even if there is some wrong on the part of the husband, the wife must
tolerate it, and thus there will be no misunderstanding between husband
and wife. Visrambhena means with intimacy, but it must not be familiarity
that breeds contempt. According to the Vedic civilization, a wife cannot call
her husband by name. In the present civilization the wife calls her husband
by name, but in Hindu civilization she does not. Thus the inferiority and
superiority complexes are recognized. Damena ca: a wife has to learn to
control herself even if there is a misunderstanding. Sauhrdena vaca
madhurayd means always desiring good for the husband and speaking to
him with sweet words. A person becomes agitated by so many material
contacts in the outside world; therefore, in his home life he must be
treated by his wife with sweet words.

TRANSLATION

Working sanely and diligently, she pleased her very powerful husband,

giving up all lust, pride, envy, greed, sinful activities and vanity.
PURPORT

Here are some of the qualities of a great husband’s great wife. Kardama
Muni is great by spiritual qualification. Such a husband is called tejiyarisam,
most powerful. Although a wife may be equal to her husband in advance-
ment in spiritual consciousness, she should not be vainly proud. Some-
times it happens that the wife comes from a very rich family, as did
Devahiti, the daughter of Emperor Svayambhuva Manu. She could have
been very proud of her parentage, but that is forbidden. The wife should
not be proud of her parental position. She must always be submissive to
the husband and must give up all vanity. As soon as the wife becomes
proud of her parentage, it creates great misunderstanding between the
husband and wife, and their nuptial life is ruined. Devahiiti was very
careful about that, and therefore it is said here that she gave up pride
completely. Devahiiti was not unfaithful. The most sinful activity for a
wife is to accept another husband or another lover. Canakya Pandita has
described four kinds of enemies at home. If the father is in debt he is .
considered to be an enemy; if the mother has selected another husband in
the presence of her grown-up children, she is considered to be an enemy;
if a wife does not live well with her husband but deals very roughly, then
she is an enemy; and if a son is a fool, he is also an enemy. In family life,
father, mother, wife and children are assets, but if the wife or mother accepts
another husband in the presence of her husband or son, then, according to
Vedic civilization, she is considered an enemy. A chaste and faithful
woman must not practice adultery—that is a greatly sinful act.

TRANSLATION
The daughter of Manu, who was fully devoted to her husband, looked
upon him as greater even than providence. Thus she expected great blessings
irom him. Having served him for a long time, she grew weak and emaciated
due to her religious observances. Seeing her condition, Kardama, the fore-
most of celestial sages, was overcome with compassion and spoke to her in
a voice choked with great love.
PURPORT
The wife is expected to be of the same category as the husband. She
must be prepared to follow the principles of the husband, and then there
will be happy life. If the husband is a devotee and the wife is materialistic,
then there cannot be any peace in the home. The wife must see the
tendencies of the husband and must be prepared to follow him. From
Mahabharata we learn that when Gandhari understood that her would-be
husband, Dhrtaragtra, was blind, she immediately began to practice blind-
ness herself. Thus she covered her eyes and played the part of a blind
woman. She decided that since her husband was blind, she must also act


--- Page 226 ---
906 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 23
like a blind woman, otherwise she would be proud of her eyes, and her
husband would be seen as inferior. The word semanuvrata indicates that it
is the duty of a wife to adopt the special circumstances in which the
husband is situated. Of course, if the husband is as great as Kardama Muni,
then a very good result accrues from following him. But even if the
husband is not a great devotee like Kardama Muni, it is the wife’s duty to
adapt herself according to his mentality. That makes married life very
happy. It is also mentioned herein that by following the strict vows of a
chaste woman, Princess Devahiiti became very skinny, and therefore her
husband became compassionate. He knew that she was the daughter of a
great king and yet was serving him just like an ordinary woman. She was
reduced in health by such activities, and he became compassionate and
addressed her as follows.

loving service. Since the body is so dear to embodied beings, Iam astonished
that you have neglected your own body to use it on my behalf.
PURPORT
It is indicated here that one’s body is very dear, yet Devahuti was so
faithful to her husband that not only did she serve him with great devotion,
service and respect, but she did not even care for her own health. That is
called selfless service. It appears that Devahiuiti had no sense pleasure, even
with her husband, otherwise she would not have deteriorated in health.
Acting to facilitate Kardama Muni’s engagement in spiritual elevation, she
continually assisted him, not caring for bodily comfort. It is the duty of a
faithful and chaste wife to help her husband in every respect, especially
when the husband is engaged in Krsna consciousness. In this case, the
husband also amply rewarded the wife. This is not to be expected by a
woman who is the wife of an ordinary person.

sciousness. Although you have not yet experienced these achievements,
which are free from fear and lamentation, 1 shall offer them all to you be-
cause you are engaged in my service. Now just look at them. 1 am giving
you the transcendental vision to see how nice they are.

PURPORT

Devahiiti engaged only in the service of Kardama Muni. She was not
supposed to be so advanced in austerity, ecstasy, meditation or Krsna
consciousness, but, imperceptibly, she was sharing her husband’s achieve-
ments, which she could neither see nor experience. Automatically she
achieved these graces of the Lord.

What are the graces of the Lord? It is stated here that the graces of the
Lord are abhaya, free from fearfulness. In the material world, if someone
accumulates a million dollars, he is always full of fear because he is
always thinking, “What if the money 15 10512 But the benediction of the
Lord, bhagavat-prasada, is never to be lost. It is simply to be enjoyed.
There is no question of loss. One simply gains and enjoys gaining.
Bhagavad-gita also confirms this: when one achieves the grace of the
Lord, the result is that sarva-duhkhdni, all distresses, are destroyed.
When situated in the transcendental position, one is freed from the two
kinds of material diseases, hankering and lamentation. This is also stated
in Bhagavad-gita. After devotional life begins, we can achieve the full
result of love of Godhead. Love of Krsna is the highest perfection of
bhagavat-prasada, or divine mercy. This transcendental achievement is so
greatly valuable that no material happiness can compare to it.
Prabodhananda Sarasvati said that if one achieves the grace of Lord
Caitanya he becomes so great that he does not care a fig even for the
demigods, he thinks of monism as hellish, and for him the perfection of
controlling the senses is as easy as anything. Heavenly pleasures become
to him no more than stories. Actually, there is no comparison between
material happiness and transcendental happiness.

By the grace of Kardama Muni, Devahiiti experienced actual realization
simply by serving. We get a similar example in the life of Narada Muni.
In his previous life, Narada was a maidservant’s son, but his mother was
engaged in the service of great devotees. He got the opportunity to serve
the devotees, and simply by eating the remnants of their foodstuff and
carrying out their orders he became so elevated that in his next life he
became the great personality Narada. For spiritual achievement the
easiest path is to take shelter of a bona fide spiritual master and to serve


--- Page 229 ---
Text 8] Devahuti’s Lamentation 909
him with heart and soul. That is the secret of success. As stated by
Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura in his eight stanzas of prayer to the spiritual
master, yasya prasadad bhagavat-prasadah. By serving or receiving the
grace of the spiritual master, one receives the grace of the Supreme
Lord. By serving her devotee-husband Kardama Muni, Bevahiiti shared in
his achievements. Similarly, a sincere disciple, simply by serving a bona
fide spiritual master, can achieve all the mercy of the Lord and the
spiritual master simultaneously.

Kardama Muni continued: What is the use of enjoyments other than the
Lord's grace? All material achievements are subject to be annihilated simply
by a movement of the eyebrows of Lord Visnu, the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. By your principles of devotion to your husband, you have
achieved and can enjoy transcendental gifts very rarely obtained by persons
proud of aristocracy and material possessions.

910 Srimad-Bhagavatam | Canto 3, Ch. 23
PURPORT

Lord Caitanya recommended that the greatest achievement of human
life is to achieve the grace of the Lord, love of God. He said, prema
pumartho mahan: To achieve love of Godhead is the highest perfection
of life. The same perfection is recommended by Kardama Muni to his
wife. His wife belonged to a very aristocratic royal family. Generally,
those who are very materialistic or who possess material wealth and
prosperity are unable to appreciate the value of transcendental love of
God. Although Devahiiti was a princess coming from a very great royal
family, fortunately she was under the supervision of her great husband
Kardama Muni, who offered her the best gift which can be bestowed in
human life, the grace of the Lord, or love of God. This grace of the Lord
was achieved by Devahiti by the good will and satisfaction of her
husband. She served her husband, who was a great devotee and saintly
person, with great sincerity, love, affection and service, and Kardama
Muni was satisfied. He willingly gave love of God, and he recommended
that she should accept it and enjoy it because he had already achieved it.

Love of God is not an ordinary commodity. Caitanya Mahaprabhu was
worshiped by Ripa Gosvami because He distributed love of God, krsna-
prema, to everyone. Ripa Gosvami praised Him as maha-vadanya, a
greatly munificent personality, because He was freely distributing to
everyone love of Godhead, which is achieved by wise men only after many,
many births. Krsna-prema, Krsna consciousness, is the highest gift which
can be bestowed on anyone whom we presume to love.

One word used in this verse, nija-dharma-dohan, is very significant.
Devabhiiti, as the wife of Kardama Muni, achieved an invaluable gift from
her husband because she was very faithful to him. For a woman the
first principle of religion is to be faithful to her husband. If, fortunately,
the husband is a great personality, then the combination is perfect, and the
lives of both the wife and the husband are at once fulfilled.

Upon hearing the speaking of her husband, who excelled in knowledge
of all kinds of transcendental science, innocent Devahtuiti was very satisfied.
Her smiling face shining with a slightly bashful glance, she spoke in a
choked voice because of great humility and love.
PURPORT
It is said that if anyone is already engaged in Krsna consciousness and is
rendering transcendental loving service to the Lord, then it can be supposed
that he has finished all the recommended courses of austerity, penance,
religion, sacrifice, mystic yoga and meditation. Devahiti’s husband was so
expert in the transcendental science that there was nothing for him to
argue about, and when she heard him speak she was confident that since
he was very much advanced in devotional service he had already surpassed
all transcendental educational activities. She had no doubt about the
gifts offered by her husband; she knew that he was expert in offering
such gifts, and when she understood that he was offering the greatest
gift, she was very satisfied. She was overwhelmed with ecstatic love, and
therefore she could not reply; then, with faltering language, just like an
attractive wife, she spoke the following words.

Sri Devahiiti said: My dear husband, O best of brahmanas, I know that
you have achieved perfection and are the master of all the infallible mystic
powers because you are under the protection of yogamaya, the transcenden-
tal nature. But you once made a promise that our bodily union should now
fulfill because children are a great quality for a chaste woman who has a
glorious husband.
PURPORT
Devahuti expressed her happiness by uttering the word bata, for she
knew that her husband was in a highly elevated transcendental position
and was under the shelter of yogamaya. As stated in Bhagavad-gita, those
who are great souls, mahatmas, are not under the control of the ma-
terial energy. The Supreme Lord has two energies, material and spiri-
tual. The living entities are marginal energy. As marginal energy, a
person may be under the control of the material energy or the spiritual en-
ergy (vogamaya). Kardama Muni was a great soul, and therefore he was un-
der the spiritual energy, which means that he was directly connected with
the Supreme Lord. The symptom of this is Krsna consciousness, constant
engagement in devotional service. This was known to Devahiti, yet
she was anxious to have a son by bodily union with the sage. She reminded


--- Page 233 ---
Text 11] Devahuti’s Lamentation 913
her husband of his promise to her parents: ^ will remain only until the
time of Devahati’s pregnancy.” She reminded him that for a chaste woman
to have a child by a great personality is most glorious. She wanted to be
pregnant, and she prayed for that. The word stri means expansion. By
bodily union of the husband and wife their qualities are expanded: children

passion, may be rendered fit for you. Also, my lord, please think of a
suitable house for this purpose.

PURPORT

The Vedic literatures are not only full of spiritual instruction, but they

are also instructive in how to prosecule material existence very nicely,
with the ultimate aim of spiritual perfection. Devahiti asked her husband,
therefore, how to prepare herself for sex life according to the Vedic
instructions. Sex life is especially meant for having good children. The
circumstances for creating good children are mentioned in kama-sastra,
the scripture in which suitable arrangements are prescribed for factually
glorious sex life. Everything needed is mentioned in the scriptures—what
sort of house and decorations there should be, what sort of dress the wife
should have, how she should be decorated with ointments, scents and
other attractive features, etc. With these requisites fulfilled, the husband
will be attracted by her beauty, and a favorable mental situation will be
created. The mental situation at the time of sex life may then be trans-
ferred into the womb of the wife, and good children can come out of that
pregnancy. Here is a special reference to Devahiiti’s bodily features.
Because she had become skinny, she feared that her body might have no
attraction for Kardama. She wanted to be instructed how to improve her
bodily condition in order to attract her husband. Sexual intercourse in
which the husband is attracted to the wife is sure to produce a male child,
but sexual intercourse based on attraction of the wife for the husband may
produce a girl. That is mentioned in the Ayur Veda. When the passion of
the woman is greater, there is a chance of a girl’s being born. When the
passion of the man is greater, then there is the possibility of a son.
Devahiiti wanted the passion of her husband to be increased by the
arrangement mentioned in the kama-sastra. She wanted him to instruct
her in that way, and she also requested that he arrange for a suitable
house because the hermitage in which Kardama Muni was living was very
simple and completely in the mode of goodness, and there was less
possibility of passion’s being aroused in his heart.

TRANSLATION
Maitreya continued: O Vidura, seeking to please his beloved wife, the
sage Kardama exercised his yogic power and instantly produced an aerial
mansion that could travel at his will.
PURPORT
Here the words yogam asthitah are significant. The sage Kardama was
completely perfect in yoga. As the result of real yoga practice there are
eight kinds of perfection: the yogi can become smaller than the smallest,
greater than the greatest, or lighter than the lightest, he can achieve
anything he likes, he can create even a planet, he can establish influence
over anyone, etc. In this way yogic perfection is achieved, and after this
one can achieve the perfection of spiritual life. Thus it was not very
wonderful for Kardama Muni to create a mansion in the air, according to
his own desire, to fulfill the desire of his beloved wife. He at once created
the palace, which is described in the following verses.

It was a wonderful structure, bedecked with all sorts of jewels, adorned
with pillars of precious stones, and capable of yielding whatever one desired.
It was equipped with every form of furniture and wealth, which tended to
increase in the course of time.
PURPORT
The castle created in the sky by Kardama Muni may be called a “castle
in the air,” but by his mystic power of yoga Kardama Muni actually
constructed a huge castle in the air. To our feeble imagination, a castle in
the sky is an impossibility, butif we scrutinizingly consider the matter we
can understand that it is not impossible at all. If the Supreme Personality
of Godhead can create so many planets, carrying millions of castles in the
air, a perfect yogi like Kardama Muni can easily construct one castle in the
air. The castle is described as sarva-kama-dugham, yielding whatever one
desired. It was full of jewels. Even the pillars were made of pearls and
valuable stones. These valuable jewels and stones were not subject to de-
terioration, but were everlastingly and increasingly opulent. We sometimes
hear of castles thus bedecked on the surface of this earth also. The castles
constructed by Lord Krsna for His 16,108 wives were so bedecked with
jewels that there was no need of lamplight during the night.

It is understood from this verse that the castle had many stories. The
words upary-upari vinyasta indicate that skyscrapers are not newly invent-
ed. Even in those days, millions of years ago, the idea of building many-
storied houses was current. They contained not merely one or two rooms,
but many different apartments, and each was completely decorated with
cushions, bedsteads, sitting places and carpets.

At the present moment people are very proud of their architectural
art, yet floors are generally decorated with colored cement. It appears,
however, that the castle constructed by the yogic powers of Kardama Muni
had floors of coral and diamonds.

palaces with decorations of jeweled birds with cyes made of valuable

stones. The stones have been taken away by the authorities, but the
decorations are still present in some of the castles constructed by the
Mogul emperors in New Delhi. The royal palaces were built with jewels
and rare stones like eyes, and thus al night they would give off reflective
light without need of lamps.

the palace vibrated with the sounds of these birds.

The castle had pleasure grounds, resting chambers, bedrooms and inner
and outer yards designed with an eye to comfort. All this caused astonish-
ment to the sage himself.
PURPORT
Kardama Muni, being a saintly person, was living in a humble hermitage,
but when he saw the palace constructed by his yogic powers, which was
full of resting rooms, rooms for sex enjoy ment, and inner and outer yards,
he himself was astonished. That is the way of a God-gifted person. A
devotee like Kardama Muni exhibited such opulence by his yogic power
at the request of his wife, but when the opulence was produced, he
himself could not understand how such manifestations could be possible.
When ayogi’s power is exhibited, the yogi himself is sometimes astonished.

could study the heart of anyone. Thus he personally addressed his wife as
follows. :

Devahiiti had spent a long time in the hermitage, not taking much care
of her body. She was covered with dirt, and her clothing was not very nice.
Kardama Muni was surprised that he could produce such a palace, and
similarly his wife Devahaiti was also astonished. How could she live in that
opulent palace? Kardama Muni could understand her astonishment, and
thus he spoke as follows.

My dear Devahiiti, you look very much afraid. First bathe in Lake
Bindu-sarovara, created by Lord Visnu Himself, which can grant all the

PURPORT
It is still the system to go to places of pilgrimage and take a bath in the
water there. In Vrndavana the people take baths in the River Yamuna. In
other places, such as Prayaga, they take baths in the River Ganges. The
words (7111401, asisam yapakam mean the fulfillment of desires by bathing
in a place of pilgrimage. Kardama Muni advised his good wife to bathe in
Lake Bindu-sarovara so that she could revive the former beauty and luster
of her body.

on her head.

It appears that Devahati’s hair had remained uncombed for many years
and had become complicated in tangles. In other words, she neglected her
bodily dress and comforts to engage in the service of her husband.

While Devahuti was thinking of what to do in that great palace in her
dirty clothes, there were at once, by the yogic powers of Kardama Muni.

Devahati within the water and presented themselves as her maidservants,
simply awaiting her orders.

TRANSLATION
Her entire body, including her head, was completely bathed, and she
was decorated all over with ornaments. She wore a special necklace with a
locket. There were bangles on her wrists and tinkling anklets of gold about
her ankles.
PURPORT
The word kyta-sirah-snanam appears here. According to the smrti-sastra’s
directions for daily duties, ladies are allowed to bathe daily up to the neck.
The hair on the head does not necessarily have to be washed daily because
the mass of wet hair may cause a cold. For ladies, therefore, taking a bath
up to the neck is ordinarily prescribed, and they take a full bath only on
certain occasions. On this occasion Devahiiti took a full bath and washed
her hair very nicely. When a lady takes an ordinary bath it is called
mala-snana, and when she takes a full bath, including the head, it is called
$irah-snana. At this time she needs sufficient oil to smear on her head.
That is the direction of the commentators of smrti-sastra.

lotus buds. Her face was surrounded by dark curling tresses.
PURPORT
According to Vedic culture, white teeth are very much appreciated.
Devahti’s white teeth increased the beauty of her face and made it look
like a lotus flower. When a face looks very attractive, the eyes are generally
compared to lotus petalsand the face to a lotus flower.

TRANSLATION
When she thought of her great husband, the best of the sages, Kardama
Muni, who was very dear to her, she, along with all the maidservants, at once
appeared where he was.
PURPORT
It appears from this verse that in the beginning Devahuti thought herself
to be dirty and very niggardly dressed. When her husband asked her to 7
enter the lake, she saw the maidservants, and they took care of her. Every-
thing was done within the water, and as soon as she thought of her beloved
husband, Kardama, she was brought before him without delay. These are
some of the powers attained by perfect yogis; they can immediately
execute anything they desire.

Bevahuti saw everything miraculously done, yet when brought before

mystic power. She understood that nothing was impossible for a yogi
like Kardama Muni.

TRANSLATION
The sage could see that Devahiiti had washed herself clean and was
shining forth as though no longer his former wife. She had regained her own
original beauty as the daughter of a prince. Dressed in excellent robes, her
charming breasts duly girded, she was waited upon by a thousand Gan-
dharva girls. O destroyer of the enemy, his fondness for her grew, and he
placed her on the aerial mansion.


--- Page 251 ---
Text 38] Devahiti’s Lamentation 931
PURPORT
Before her marriage, when Devahiiti was brought by her parents before
the sage Kardama, she was the perfectly beautiful princess, and Kardama
Muni remembered her former beauty. But after her marriage, when she
was engaged in the service of Kardama Muni, she neglected to care for her
body like a princess, since there was no means for such care; her husband
was living in a cottage, and since she was always engaged in serving him,
her royal beauty disappeared, and she became just like an ordinary maid-
servant. Now, after being bathed by the Gandharva girls by the order of
Kardama Muni’s yogic power, she regained her beauty, and Kardama Muni
felt attracted to the beauty she had shown before the marriage. The
real beauty of a young woman is her breasts. When Kardama Muni saw the
breasts of his wife so nicely decorated, increasing her beauty many times,
he was attracted, even though he was a great sage. Sripada Sankaracarya
has therefore warned the transcendentalists that one who is after transcen-
dental realization should not be attracted by the raised breasts of a woman
because they are nothing but an interaction of fat and blood within the
body.

932 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 23
TRANSLATION
Though seemingly attached to his beloved consort while served by the
Gandharva girls, the sage did not lose his glory, which was mastery over his
self. In the aerial mansion Kardama Muni with his consort shone as charm-
ingly as the moon in the midst of the stars in the sky, which causes rows of
lilies to open in ponds at night.
PURPORT
The mansion was in the sky, and therefore the comparison to the full
moon and the stars is very beautifully composed in this verse. Kardama
Muni looked like the full moon, and the girls who surrounded his wife,
Bevahiiti, seemed just like the stars. On 8 full-moon night the stars and
the moon together form a beautiful constellation; similarly, in that aerial
mansion in the sky, Kardama Muni with his beautiful wife and the damsels
surrounding them appeared like the moon and stars on a full-moon night.

Text 40] Devahati’s Lamentation 933
TRANSLATION

In that aerial mansion he traveled to the pleasure valleys of Mount Meru,
which were rendered all the more beautiful by cool, gentle, fragrant breezes
that stimulated passion. In these valleys, the treasurer of the gods, Kuvera,
surrounded by beautiful women and praised by the Siddhas, generally
enjoys pleasure. Kardama Muni also, surrounded by the beautiful damsels
and his wife, went there and enjoyed for many, many years.

PURPORT

Kuvera is one of the eight demigods who are in charge of the different
directions of the universe. It is said that Indra is in charge of the eastern
side of the universe, where the heavenly planet, or paradise, is situated.
Similarly, Agni is in charge of the southeastern portion of the universe;
Yama, the demigod who punishes sinners, is in charge of the southern
portion; Nirrti is in charge of the southwestern part of the universe;
Varuna, the demigod in charge of the waters, is in charge of the western
portion; Vayu, who controls the air and who has wings to travel in the air,
is in charge of the northwestern part of the universe, and Kuvera, the
treasurer of the demigods, is in charge of the northern part of the universe.
All these demigods take pleasure in the valleys of Mount Meru, which is
situated somewhere between the sun and the carth. In the aerial mansion,
Kardama Muni traveled throughout the eight directions controlled by the
different demigods described above, and as the demigods go to Mount
Meru, he also went there to enjoy life. When one is surrounded by young,
beautiful girls, sex stimulation naturally becomes prominent. Kardama
Muni was sexually stimulated, and he enjoyed his wife for many, many
years in that part of Mount Meru. But his sex indulgence was praised by
many, many Siddhas, beings who have attained perfection, because it was
intended to produce good progeny for the good of universal affairs.

TRANSLATION
He traveled in that way through the various planets, as the air passes
uncontrolled in every direction. Coursing through the air in that great and
splendid aerial mansion, which could fly at his will, he surpassed even the
demigods.
PURPORT
The planets occupied by the demigods are restricted to their own orbits,
but Kardama Muni, by his yogic power, could travel all over the different
directions of the universe without restriction. The living entities who are
within the universe are called conditioned souls; that is, they are not free


--- Page 255 ---
Text 42] Devahati’s Lamentation 935
to move everywhere. We are inhabitants of this earthly globe; we cannot
move freely to other planets. In the modern age man is trying to go to
other planets, but so far he has been unsuccessful. It is not possible to
travel to any other planets because by the laws of nature even the
demigods cannot move from one planet to another. But Kardama Muni, by
his yogic power, could surpass the strength of the demigods and travel in
space in all directions. The comparison here is very suitable. The words
yatha anilah indicate that as the air is free to move anywhere without
restriction, so Kardama Muni unrestrictedly traveled in all directions of the
universe.

TRANSLATION
What is difficult to achieve for determined men who have taken refuge
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead’s lotus feet? His feet are the source
of sacred rivers like the Ganges, which put an end to the dangers of mun-
dane life.
PURPORT

The words yair asritas tirtha-padas caranpah are significant here. The
Supreme Personality of Godhead is known as tirtha-pada. The Ganges is
called a sacred river because it emanates from the toe of Vispu. The
Ganges is meant to eradicate all the material distresses of the conditioned
souls. For any living entity, therefore, who has taken shelter of the holy
lotus feet of the Lord, nothing is impossible. Kardama Muni is special not
because he was a great mystic, but because he was a great devotee.
Therefore it is said here that for a great devotee like Kardama Muni,


--- Page 256 ---
936 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 23
nothing is impossible. Although yogis can perform wonderful feats, as
Kardama has already displayed, Kardama was more than a yogt because he
was a great devotee of the Lord; therefore he was more glorious than an
ordinary yogi. As it is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita, “Out of the many
yogis, he who is a devotee of the Lord is first class.” For a person like
Kardama Muni there is no question of being conditioned; he was already a
liberated soul and better than the demigods, who are also conditioned.
Although he was enjoying with his wife and many other women, he was
above material conditional life. Therefore the word vyasanatyayah is used
to indicate that he was beyond the position of a conditioned soul. He was
transcendental to all material limitations.

TRANSLATION
After showing his wife the globe of the universe and its different arrange-
ments, full of many wonders, the great yogi Kardama Muni returned to his
own hermitage.
PURPORT
All the planets are here described as gola, round. Every planet is
round, and each planet is a different shelter, just like islands in the great
ocean. Planets are sometimes called dvipa or varsa. This earth planct is
called Bharata-varsa because it was ruled by King Bharata. Another signifi-
cant word used in this verse is bahv-dscarya, “many wonderful things.”
This indicates that the different planets are distributed all over the uni-


--- Page 257 ---
Text 44] Devahiti’s Lamentation 937
verse in the eight directions, and each and every one of them is wonderful
in itself. Each planet has its particular climatic influences and particular
types of inhabitants and is completely equipped with everything, including
the beauty of the seasons. In the Brahma-sarnhita (Bs. 5.40) it is similarly
stated, vibhuti-bhinnam: on each and every planet there are different
opulences. It cannot be expected that one planet is exactly like another.
By God’s grace, by nature’s law, each and every planet is made differently
and has different wonderful features. All such wonders were personally
experienced by Kardama Muni while he traveled with his wife, yet he
could return again to his humble hermitage. He showed his princess wife
that although he was living in the hermitage, he had the power to go
everywhere and do anything by mystic yoga. That is the perfection of
yoga. One cannot become a perfect yogi simply by showing some sitting
postures, nor by such sitting postures or so-called meditation can one
become God, as is being advertised. Foolish persons are misled into
believing that simply by some caricature of meditation and sitting postures
one can become God within six months.

Here is the example of a perfect yogi; he could travel all over the
universe. Similarly, there is a description of Durvasa Muni, who also
traveled in space. Actually, the perfect yogi can do that. But even if one
can travel all over the universe and show wonderful feats like Kardama
Muni, he cannot be compared to the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
whose power and inconceivable energy can never be attained by any
conditioned or liberated soul. By the actions of Kardama Muni we can
understand that in spite of his immense mystic power, he remained a
devotee of the Lord. That is the real position of every living entity.

TRANSLATION
After coming back to his hermitage, he divided himself into nine person-
alities just to give pleasure to Devahiti, the daughter of Manu, who was
eager for sex life. In that way he enjoyed with her for many, many years,
which passed just like a moment.
PURPORT
Here the daughter of Svayambhuva Manu, Devahiti, is described as
suratotsuka. After traveling with her husband all over the universe, in
Mount Meru and the beautiful gardens of the heavenly kingdoms, she
naturally became sexually stimulated, and in order to satisfy her sexual
desire, Kardama Muni expanded himself into nine forms. Instead of one,
he became nine, and nine persons had sexual intercourse with Devahuti
for many, many years. It is understood that the sexual appetite of a
woman is nine times greater than that of a man. That is clearly indicated
here. Otherwise, Kardama Muni would have had no reason to expand
himself into nine. Here is another example of yogic power. As the Supreme
Personality of Godhead can expand Himself in millions of forms, so a yogi
can also expand up to nine forms, but not more than that. Another
example is that of Saubhari Muni; he also expanded himself into eight
forms. But however powerful a yogi may be, he cannot expand himself
into more than eight or nine forms. The Supreme Personality of God-
head, however, can expand Himself into millions of forms, ananta-rupa—
innumerable, countless forms—as stated in the Brahma-samhita. No one
can compare to the Supreme Personality of Godhead by any conceivable
energetic manifestation of power.

not realize how much time was passing.

Sex indulgence is so enjoyable for materialistic people that when they
engage in such activities they forget how time is passing. Saint Kardama
and Devahiiti, in their sex indulgence, also forgot how time was passing by.

he could grant whatever one desired. Knowing the spiritual soul, he re-

pregnated Devahiiti with nine discharges of semina.
PURPORT
Since Kardama Muni could understand that Devahuti wanted many
children, at the first chance he begot nine children at one time. He is
described here as vibhu, the most powerful master. By his yogic power he
could at once produce nine daughters in the womb of Devahuti.

Immediately afterwards, on the same day, Devahiiti gave birth to nine
female children, all charming in every limb and fragrant with the scent of
the red lotus flower.
PURPORT
Devahiiti was too sexually excited, and therefore she discharged more
ova, and nine daughters were born. It is said in the smyti-sastra as well as
in the Ayur Veda that when the discharge of the male is greater, then male
children are begotten, but when the discharge of the female is greater,
female children are begotten. It appears from the circumstances that
Devahiiti was more sexually excited, and therefore she had nine daughters
at once. All the daughters, however, were very beautiful, and their bodies
were nicely formed; each resembled a lotus flower and was fragrant like a
lotus.

with his wife in the company of beautiful girls, and begetting of children
were finished, and now, according to his promise to leave home for his
real concern of spiritual realization after impregnating his wife, he was
about to go away. Seeing her husband about to 1৩৪০, Devahiiti was very
disturbed, but to satisfy her husband she was smiling. The example of
Kardama Muni should be understood very clearly; a person whose main
concern is Krsna consciousness, even if he is entrapped in household life,
should always be ready to leave household enticement as soon as possible.

PURPORT
Devahuiti was so beautiful that her toenails appeared just like pearls, and
as she scratched the ground it appeared as if pearls had been thrown on
the ground. When a woman scratches the ground with her foot, it is a sign
that her mind is very disturbed. These signs were sometimes exhibited by
the gopis before Krsna. When the gopis came in the dead of night and
Krsna asked them to return to their homes, the gopis also scratched the
ground like this because their minds were very disturbed.

Devahiiti requested her husband to grant her something without fear.
As a wife, she was a fully surrendered soul to her husband, and it is the
responsibility of the husband to give his wife fearlessness. How one awards
fearlessness to his subordinate is mentioned in the Fifth Canto of Srimad-
Bhagavatam. One who cannot get free from the clutches of death is
dependent, and he should not become a spiritual master, nor a husband,
nor a kinsman, nor a father, nor a mother, etc. It is the duty of the
superior to give fearlessness to the subordinate. To take charge of some-
one, therefore, either as father, mother, spiritual master, relative or hus-
band, one must accept the responsibility to give his ward freedom from
the fearful situation of material existence. Material existence is always
fearful and full of anxiety. Devahiiti is saying, “You have given me all
sorts of material comforts by your yogic power, and since you are now
prepared to go away, you must give me your last award so that [ may get
free from this material conditional life.”

brahman—my dear brahmaga; duhitrbhih —by the daughters themselves;
tubhyam—for you; vimrgyah—to be found out; patayah—husbands; samah—
suitable; kascit—someone; syat—there should be; me—my; visokaya—for
solace; tvayi—when you; pravrajite—departed; vanam—to the forest.

TRANSLATION

My dear brahmana, as far as your daughters are concerned, they will
find their own suitable husbands and go away to their respective homes.
But who will give me solace after your departure as a sannyasi?

PURPORT

It is said that the father himself becomes the son in another form. The
father and son are therefore considered to be nondifferent. A widow who
has her son is actually not a widow because she has the representative of
her husband. Similarly, Devahiiti is indirectly asking Kardama Muni to
leave a representative so that in his absence she might be relieved of her
anxieties by a suitable son. A householder is not expected to remain at
home for all his days. After getting his sons and daughters married, a
householder can retire from household life, leaving his wife in the charge
of the grown-up sons. That is the social convention of the Vedic system.
Devahiiti is indirectly asking that in his absence from home there be at
least one male child to give her relief from her anxieties. This relief means
spiritual instruction. Relief does not mean material comforts. Material
comforts will end with the end of the body, but spiritual instruction
will not end; it will go on with the spirit soul. Instruction in spiritual
advancement is necessary, but without having a worthy son, how could
Devahati advance in spiritual knowledge? It is the duty of the husband to
liquidate his debt to his wife. The wife gives her sincere service to the
husband, and he becomes indebted to her because one cannot accept


--- Page 265 ---
Text 53] Devahiiti’s Lamentation 945
service from his subordinate without giving him something in exchange.
The spiritual master cannot accept service from a disciple without awarding
him spiritual instruction. That is the reciprocation of love and duty. Thus
Devahuti reminds her husband, Kardama Muni, that she has rendered him
faithful service. Even considering the situation on the basis of liquidating
his debt towards his wife, he must give a male child before he leaves.
Indirectly, Devahiiti requests her husband to remain at home a few days
more, or at least until a male child is born.

TRANSLATION
Until now we have simply wasted so much of our time in sense gratifica-

PURPORT
Human life is not meant to be wasted, like that of the animals, in sense
gratificatory activities. Animals always engage in sense gratification—
eating, sleeping, fearing and mating—but that is not the engagement of the
human being, although, because of the material body, there is need
of sense gratification according to a regulative principle. So, in effect,
Devahuti said to her husband: “So far we have these daughters, and we
have enjoyed material life in the aerial mansion, traveling all over the
universe. These boons have come by your grace, but they have all been
for sense gratification. Now there must be something for my spiritual
advancement.”

TRANSLATION

Not knowing your transcendental situation, I have loved you while re-

I have developed for you rid me of all fear.

PURPORT

Devahiiti is lamenting her position. As a woman, she had to love
someone. Somehow or other, she came to love Kardama Muni, but
without knowing of his spiritual advancement. Kardama Muni could
understand Devahuti’s heart; generally all women desire material enjoy-
ment. They are called less intelligent because they are mostly prone to
material enjoyment. Devahiti laments because her husband had given her
the best kind of material enjoyment, but she did not know that he was so
advanced in spiritual realization. Her plea was that even though she did
not know the glories of her great husband, because she had taken shelter
of him she must therefore be delivered from material entanglement.
Association with a great personality is most important. In Caitanya-
caritamrta Lord Caitanya says that sadhu-sanga, the association of a great
saintly person, is very important, because even if one is not advanced in
knowledge, simply by association with a great saintly person one can
immediately make considerable advancement in spiritual life. As a woman,
as an ordinary wife, Devahuti became attached to Kardama Muni in order
to satisfy her sense enjoyment and other material necessities, but actually


--- Page 267 ---
Text 55] Devahiiti’s Lamentation 947
she associated with a great personality. Now she understood this, and she
wanted to utilize the advantage of the association of her great husband.

TRANSLATION
Association for sense gratification is certainly the path of bondage. But
the same type of association, performed with a saintly person, leads to the
path of liberation, even if performed without knowledge.
PURPORT
The association of a saintly person in any way bears the same result.
For example, Lord Krsna met many kinds of living entities, and some
treated Him as an enemy, and some treated Him as an agent for sense
gratification. It is generally said that the gopis were attached to Krsna for
sense attractions, and yet they became first-class devotees of the Lord.
Kamsa, 5150813, Dantavakra and other demons, however, were related to
Krsna as enemies. But whether they associated with Krsna as enemies or
for sense gratification, out of fear or as pure devotees, they all got
liberation. That is the result of association with the Lord. Even if one does
not understand who He is, the results have the same efficacy. Association
with a great saintly person also results in liberation, just as whether one
goes towards fire knowingly or unknowingly, the fire will make him
warm. Devahiiti expressed her gratefulness, for although she wanted to


--- Page 268 ---
948 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 23
associate with Kardama Muni only for sense gratification, because he was
spiritually great she was sure to be liberated by his benediction.

TRANSLATION
Anyone whose work is not meant to elevate him to religious life, anyone
whose religious ritualistic performances do not raise him to renunciation,
and anyone situated in renunciation that does not lead him to devotional
service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, must be considered dead,
although he is breathing.
PURPORT
Devahiiti’s statement is that since she was attached to living with her
husband for sense gratification, which does not lead to liberation from
material entanglement, her life was simply a waste of time. Any work one
performs that does not lead to the state of religious life is useless activity.
Everyone is by nature inclined to some sort of work, and when that work
leads one to religious life, religious life leads one to renunciation, and
renunciation leads one to devotional service, that is the perfection of
work. As stated in Bhagavad-gita, any work that does not lead ultimately
to the standard of devotional service is a cause of bondage in the material
world. Yajiarthat karmano ’‘nyatra loko ‘yam karma-bandhanah. Unless
one is gradually elevated to the position of devotional service, beginning
from his natural activity, he is to be considered a dead body. Work which
does not léad one to the understanding of Krsna consciousness is
considered useless.

TRANSLATION

My lord, surely I have been solidly cheated by the insurmountable illu-
sory energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for in spite of having
obtained your association, which gives liberation from material bondage, I
did not seek such liberation.

PURPORT

An intelligent man should utilize good opportunities. The first
opportunity is the human form of life, and the second opportunity
is to take birth in a suitable family where there is cultivation of spiritual
knowledge; this is rarely obtained. The greatest opportunity is to have the
association of a saintly person. Devahuti was conscious that she was born
as the daughter of an emperor. She was sufficiently educated and cultured,
and at last she got Kardama Muni, a saintly person and a great yogi, as her
husband. Still, if she did not get liberation from the entanglement of
material energy, then certainly she would be cheated by the insurmount-
able illusory energy. Actually, the illusory material energy is cheating
everyone. People do not know what they are doing when they worship
the material energy in the form of goddess Kall or Durga for material
boons. They ask, “Mother, give me great riches, give me a good wife, give
me fame, give me victory.” But such devotees of the goddess Maya or
Durga do not know that they are being cheated by that goddess. Material
achievement is actually no achievement because as soon as one is illusioned
by the material gifts, he becomes more and more entangled, and there is


--- Page 270 ---
950 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 23
no question of liberation. One should be intelligent enough to know how
to utilize material assets for the purpose of spiritual realization. That is
called karma-yoga or jiana-yoga. Whatever we have we should use as
service to the Supreme Person. It is advised in Bhagavad-gita, sva-karmana
tam abhyarcya. One should try to worship the Surpeme Personality of
Godhead by one’s assets. There are many forms of service to the Supreme
Lord, and anyone can render service unto Him according to his best
ability.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Third Canto, Twenty-third
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “‘Devahuti’s Lamentation.”

Text 4] The Renunciation of Kardama Muni 953
PURPORT

In order to spiritually advance or to achieve the mercy of the Lord, one
must be self-controlled in the following manner: he must be restrained in
sense gratification and must follow the rules and regulations of religious
principles. Without austerity and penance and without sacrificing one’s
riches, one cannot achieve the mercy of the Supreme Lord. Kardama
Muni advised his wife: “You have to factually engage in devotional service
with austerity and penance, following the religious principles and giving in
charity. Then the Supreme Lord will be pleased with you, and He will come
as your son.”

TRANSLATION

The Personality of Godhead, being worshiped by you, will spread my
name and fame. He will vanquish the knot of your heart by becoming your
son and teaching knowledge of Brahman.

PURPORT

When the Supreme Personality of Godhead comes to disseminate spiri-
tual knowledge for the benefit of all people, he generally descends as the
son of a devotee, being pleased by the devotee’s devotional service. The
Supreme Personality of Godhead is the father of everyone. No one, there-
fore, is His father, but by His inconceivable energy He accepts some of the
devotees as His parents and descendants. It is explained here that spiritual
knowledge vangquishes the knot of the heart. Matter and spirit are knotted
by false ego. This identification of oneself with matter, which is called


--- Page 274 ---
954. Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 24
hrdaya-granthi, exists for all conditioned souls, and it becomes more and
more tightened when there is too much affection for sex life. The explana-
tion was given by Lord Rsabha to his sons that this material world is an at-
mosphere of attraction between male and female. That attraction takes the
shape of a knot in the heart, and by material affection it becomes still
more tight. For people who hanker after material possessions, society,
friendship and love, this knot of affection becomes very strong. It is only by
brahma-bhavana—the instruction by which spiritual knowledge is enhanced
—that the knot in the heart is cut to pieces. No material weapon is needed
to cut this knot, but it requires bona fide spiritual instruction. Kardama
Muni instructed his wife, Devahuti, that the Lord would appear as her son
and disseminate spiritual knowledge to cut the knot of material identifica-
tion.

Sri Maitreya said: Devahiiti was fully faithful and respectful towards the
direction of her husband, Kardama, who was one of the prajapatis, or gen-
erators of human beings in the universe. O great sage, she thus began to
worship the master of the universe, the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
who is situated in everyone’s heart.


--- Page 275 ---
Text 6] The Renunciation of Kardama Muni 955
PURPORT

This is the process of spiritual realization; one has to receive instruction
from a bona fide spiritual master. Although Kardama Muni was Devahiiti’s
husband, because he instructed her on how to achieve spiritual perfection,
he naturally became her spiritual master also. There are many instances
wherein the husband becomes the spiritual master. Lord Siva also is the
spiritual master of his consort, Parvati. A husband should be so enlightened
that he should become the spiritual master of his wife in order to enlighten
her in the advancement of Krsna consciousness. Generally stri, or woman,
is less intelligent than man; therefore, if the husband is intelligent enough,
the woman gets a great opportunity for spiritual enlightenment.

Here it is clearly said (samyak Sraddhaya) that with great faith one
should receive knowledge from the spiritual master and with great faith
execute the performance of service. Srila Vigvanatha Cakravarti Thakura, in
his commentary on Bhagavad-gita, has especially stressed the instruction
of the spiritual master. One should accept the instruction of the spiritual
master as one’s life and soul. Whether one is liberated or not liberated, he
should execute the instruction of the spiritual master with great faith.
It is also stated that the Lord is situated in everyone's heart. One doesn’t
have to seek the Lord outside; He is already there. One simply has to
concentrate on his worship in good faith, as instructed by the bona fide
spiritual master, and his efforts will come out successfully. It is also clear
that the Supreme Personality of Godhead does not appear as an ordinary
child; He appears as He is. As stated in Bhagavad-gita, He appears by His
own internal potency, atma-maya. And how does He appear? He appears
when pleased by the worship of a devotee. A devotee may ask the Lord to
appear as her son. The Lord is already sitting within the heart, and if He
comes out from the body of a devotee it does not mean that the particular
woman becomes His mother in the material sense. He is always there, but
in order to please His devotee, He appears as her son.

Madhu; kardamam—of Kardama; viryam—the semina; apannah—entered;

TRANSLATION

After many, many years, the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Madhusiidana, the killer of the demon Madhu, having entered the semina
of Kardama, appeared in Devahiiti just as fire comes from wood in a
sacrifice.

PURPORT

It is clearly stated here that the Lord is always the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, although He appeared as the son of Kardama Muni. Fire is
already present in wood, but by a certain process, fire is kindled. Similarly,
God is all-pervading. He is everywhere, and since He may come out from
everything, He appeared in His devotee’s semina. Just as an ordinary living
entity takes his birth by taking shelter of the semina of a certain living
entity, similarly the Supreme Personality of Godhead accepts the shelter
of the semina of His devotee and comes out as His son. This manifests His
full independence to act in any way, and it does not mean that He is an
ordinary living entity forced to take birth in a certain type of womb. Lord
Nrsimhha appeared from the pillar of Hiranyakasipu’s palace, Lord Varaha
appeared from the nostril of Brahma, and Lord Kapila appeared from the
semina of Kardama, but this does not mean that the nostril of Brahma or
the pillar of Hiranyakadipu’s palace or the semina of Kardama Muni is the
source of the appearance of the Lord. The Lord is always the Lord.
Bhagavan madhusiidanah—He is the killer of all kinds of demons, and He
always remains the Lord, even if He appears as the son of a particular
devotee. The word kardamam is significant, for it indicates that the Lord
had some devotional affection or relationship in devotional service with
Kardama and Devahuti. But we should not mistakenly understand that He
was born just like an ordinary living entity from the semina of Kardama
Muni in the womb of Devahuti.

travel in outer space, we are hampered by so many impediments, but they
are not. We learn from the pages of Srimad-Bhagavatam that the inhabi-
tants of the planet called Siddhaloka can travel in space from one planet
to another without impediment. They showered flowers on the earth
when Lord Kapila, the son of Kardama, appeared.

TRANSLATION

Maitreya continued: O killer of the enemy, the unborn Lord Brahma,
who is almost independent in acquiring knowledge, could understand that
a portion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in His quality of pure
existence, had appeared in the womb of Devahiiti just to explain the com-
plete state of knowledge known as sarikhya-yoga.

PURPORT

In Bhagavad-gita, Fifteenth Chapter, it is stated that the Lord Himself
is the compiler of Vedanta-siitra, and He is the perfect knower of Vedanta-
50870. Similarly, the sarikhya philosophy is compiled by the Supreme
Personality of Godhead in His appearance as Kapila. There is an
imitation Kapila who has a sarikhya philosophical system, but Kapila the
incarnation of God is different from that Kapila. Kapila, the son of
Kardama Muni, in His system of sdrikhya philosophy, very explicitly
explained not only the material world but also the spiritual world.
Brahma could understand this fact because he is sva-rat, almost independent
in receiving knowledge. Heis called sva-ra¢ because he did not go to any
school or college to learn but learned everything from within. Because
Brahma is the first living creature within this universe, he had no teacher;
his teacher was the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, who is
seated in the heart of every living creature. Brahma acquired knowledge
directly from the Supreme Lord within the heart; therefore he is some-
times called sva-rat and aja.

Another important point is stated here. Sattvendmsena: when
the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears, He brings with Him
all His paraphernalia of Vaikuntha; therefore His name, His form,
His quality, His paraphernalia and His entourage all belong to the
transcendental world. Real goodness is in the transcendental world.
Here in the material world, the quality of goodness is not pure.


--- Page 280 ---
960 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 24
Goodness may exist, but there must also be some tinges of passion and
ignorance. In the spiritual world the unalloyed quality of goodness pre-
vails; there the quality of goodness is called suddha-sattva, pure goodness.
Another name for suddha-sattva is vasudeva because God is born from
Vasudeva. Another meaning is that when one is purely situated in the
qualities of goodness, he can understand the form, name, quality,
paraphernalia and entourage of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
The word arii$ena also indicates that the Supreme Personality of Godhead
Krsna appeared as Kapiladeva in His portion of the portion. God expands
either as kala or as 7154. 47150 means direct expansion, and 10010 means
expansion of the expansion. There is no difference between the expansion,
the expansion of the expansion and the Supreme Personality of Godhead
directly, as there is no difference between one candle and another—but
still the candle from which the others are lit is called the original. Krsna,
therefore, is called the Parabrahman, or the Ultimate Godhead and
cause of all causes.

After worshiping the Supreme Lord with gladdened senses and a pure

to Kardama and Devahuti.

PURPORT

As explained in Bhagavad-gitd, Fourth Chapter, anyone who under-
stands the transcendental activities, the appearance and disappearance of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead is to be considered liberated.


--- Page 281 ---
Text 12] The Renunciation of Kardama Muni 961
Brahma, therefore, is a liberated soul. Although he is in charge of this
material world, he is not exactly like the common living entity. Since he
is liberated from the majority of the follies of the common living entities,
he was in knowledge of the appearance of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, and he therefore worshiped the Lord’s activities, and with a
glad heart he also praised Kardama Muni because the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, as Kapila, appeared as his son. One who can become the
father of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is certainly a great devotee.
There is a verse spoken by a brahmana in which he says that he does not
know what the Vedas and what the Purdnas are, but while others might
be interested in the Vedas or Puranas, he is interested in Nanda Maharaja,
who appeared as the father of Krsna. He wanted to worship Nanda
Maharaja because the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as a child,
crawled in the yard of his house. These are some of the good sentiments
of devotees. If a recognized devotee brings forth the Supreme Personality
of Godhead as his son, how he should be praised! Brahma, therefore, not
only worshiped the incarnation of Godhead Kapila, but he praised His
so-called father, Kardama Muni.

you have worshiped me properly. Whatever instructions you took from me
you have carried out, and thereby you have honored me.
PURPORT
Lord Brahma, as the first living entity within the universe, is supposed
to be the spiritual master of everyone, and he is also the father, the
creator, of all beings. Kardama Muni is one of the prajapatis, or creators
of the living entities, and he is also a son of Brahma. Brahma praises
Kardama because he carried out the orders of the spiritual master in toto
and without cheating. A conditioned soul in the material world has the
disqualification of cheating. He has four disqualifications: he is sure to
commit mistakes, he is sure to be illusioned, he is prone to cheat others,
and his senses are imperfect. But if anyone carries out the order of the
spiritual master by disciplic succession or the parampara system, he
overcomes the four defects. Therefore, knowledge received from the bona
fide spiritual master is not cheating. Any other knowledge which is
manufactured by the conditioned soul is cheating only. Brahma knew well
that Kardama Muni exactly carried out the instructions received from
him and that he actually honored his spiritual master. To honor the
spiritual master means to carry out his instructions word for word.

Text 14] The Renunciation of Kardama Muni 963
PURPORT

Two words in this verse are very important; one word is pitari, and
another word is guroh. The son or disciple should accept the words of his:
spiritual master and father without hesitation. Whatever the father and
the spiritual master order should be taken without argument: “Yes.”
There should be no instance in which the disciple or the son says, “This
is not correct. I cannot carry it out.” When he says that, he is fallen. The
father and the spiritual master are on the same platform because a
spiritual master is the second father. The higher classes are called dvija,
twice-born. Whenever there is a question of birth, there must be a
father. The first birth is made possible by the actual father, and the second
birth is made possible by the spiritual master. Sometimes the father and
the spiritual master may be the same man, and sometimes they are
different men. In any case, the order of the father or the order of the
spiritual master must be carried out without hesitation, with an immediate
“yes.” There should be no argument. That is real service to the father and
to the spiritual master. Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura has stated that the
order of the spiritual master is the life and soul of the disciples. As a man
cannot separate his life from his body, so a disciple cannot separate the
order of the spiritual master from his life. If a disciple follows the
instruction of the spiritual master in that way, he is sure to become
perfect. This is confirmed in the Upanisads: the import of Vedic
instruction is revealed automatically only to one who has implicit faith
in the Supreme Personality of Godhead and in his spiritual master. One
may be materially considered an illiterate man, but if he has faith in the
spiritual master as well as in the Supreme Personality of Godhead. then the
meaning of scriptural revelation is immediately manifested before him.

TRANSLATION

Lord Brahma then praised Kardama Muni’s nine daughters, saying: All
your thin-waisted daughters are certainly very chaste. I am sure they will
increase this creation by their own descendants in various ways.

PURPORT

In the beginning of creation, Brahma was concerned more or less with
increasing the population, and when he saw that Kardama Muni had
already begotten nine nice daughters, he was hopeful that through the
daughters many children would come who would take charge of the
creative principle of the material world. He was therefore happy to
see them. The word sumadhyama means a good daughter of a beautiful
woman. If she has a thin waist, a woman is considered very beautiful.
All the daughters of Kardama Muni were of the same beautiful feature.

Text 15] The Renunciation of Kardama Muni 965
PURPORT

The nine principal ysis or sages are Marici, Atri, Angira, Pulastya,
Pulaha, Kratu, Bhrgu, Vasigtha and Atharva. All these rsis are most
important, and Brahma desired that the nine daughters already born of
Kardama Muni be handed over to them. Here two words are used very
significantly—yathd-silam and yathd-ruci. The daughters should be handed
over to the respective 7585, not blindly but according to the combination of
character and taste. That is the art of combining a man and woman. Man
and woman should not be united simply on the consideration of sex life.
There are many other considerations, especially character and taste. If the
taste and character differ between the man and woman, their combination
will be unhappy. Even about forty years ago, in Indian marriages, the
taste and character of the boy and girl were first of all matched, and then
they were allowed to marry. This was done under the direction of the
respective parents. The parents used to astrologically determine the
character and tastes of the boy and girl, and when they corresponded, the
match was selected: “This girl and this boy are just suitable, and they
should be married.” Other considerations were less important. The same
system was also advised in the beginning of the creation by Brahma:
“Your daughters should be handed over to the rsis according to taste and
character.”

According to astrological calculation, a person is classified according to
whether he belongs to the godly or demoniac quality. In that way the
spouse was selected. A girl of godly quality should be handed over to a
boy of godly quality. A girl of demoniac quality should be handed over
to a boy of demoniac quality. Then they will be happy. But if the girl is
demoniac and the boy is godly, then the combination is incompatible;
they cannot be happy in such a marriage. At the present moment, because
boys and girls are not married according to quality and character, most
marriages are unhappy, and there is divorce.

It is foretold in the Twelfth Canto of the Bhagavatam that in this age
of Kali married life will be accepted on the consideration of sex only;
when the boy and the girl are pleased in sex, they get married, and when
there is deficiency in sex, they separate. That is not actual marriage, but a
combination of men and women like cats and dogs. Therefore, the children
produced in the modern age are not exactly human beings. Human beings
must be twice-born. A child is first born of a good father and mother, and
then he is born again of the spiritual master and the Vedas. The first
mother and father bring about his birth into the world; then the spiritual


--- Page 286 ---
966 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 24
master and the Vedas become his second father and mother. According to
the Vedic system of marriage for producing children, every man and
woman was enlightened in spiritual knowledge, and at the time of their
combination to produce a child, everything was scrutinizingly and scien-
tifically done.

TRANSLATION

O Kardama, I know that the original Supreme Personality of Godhead
has now appeared as an incarnation by His internal energy. He is the
bestower of all desired by the living entities, and He has now assumed the
body of Kapila Muni.

PURPORT

In this verse we find the words purusam avatirparh sva-mayaya. The
Supreme Personality of Godhead is everlastingly, eternally, the form of
puruga, the predominator or enjoyer, and when He appears He never
accepts anything of this material energy. The spiritual world is a
manifestation of His personal, internal potency, whereas the material
world is a manifestation of His material or differentiated energy. The
word sva-mdyayd, by His own internal potency, indicates that whenever the
Supreme Personality of Godhead descends, He comes in His own
energy. He may assume the body of a human being, but that body is not
material. In Bhagavadgita, therefore, it is clearly stated that only fools
and rascals, midhas, consider the body of Krsna to be the body of a
common human being. The word sevadhim means that He is the original


--- Page 287 ---
Text 17] The Renunciation of Kardama Muni 967
bestower of all the necessities of life upon the living entities. In the Vedas
also it is stated that He is the chief living entity, and He bestows all the
desired necessities of other living entities. Because He is the bestower of
the necessities of all others, he is called God. The Supreme is also a
living entity; He is not impersonal. As we are individual, so the Supreme
Personality of Godhead is also individual-but He is the supreme
individual. That is the difference between God and the ordinary living
entities.

TRANSLATION

By mystic yoga and the practical application of knowledge from the
scriptures, Kapila Muni, who is characterized by His golden hair, His eyes
just like lotus petals, and His lotus feet, which bear the marks of lotus
flowers, will uproot the deep-rooted desire for work in this material world.

PURPORT

In this verse the activities and bodily features of Kapila Muni are very
nicely described. The activities of Kapila Muni are forecast herein: He will
present the philosophy of saikhya in such a way that by studying His
philosophy people will be able to uproot the deep-rooted desire for
karma, fruitive activities. Everyone in this material world engages in
achieving the fruits of his labor. A man tries to be happy by achieving
the fruits of his own honest labor, but actually he becomes more and more
entangled. One cannot get out of this entanglement unless he has perfect
knowledge or devotional service.


--- Page 288 ---
968 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 24

Those who are trying to get out of the entanglement by speculation are
also doing their best, but in the Vedic scriptures we find that if anyone
has taken to the devotional service of the Lord in Krsna consciousness, he
can very easily uproot the deep-rooted desire for fruitive activities.
Sankhya philosophy will be broadcast by Kapila Muni for that purpose.
His bodily features are also described herein. Jiiana does not refer to
ordinary research work. Jiiana entails receiving knowledge from the
scriptures through the spiritual master by disciplic succession. In the
modern age there is a tendency to do research by mental speculation and
concoction. But the man who speculates forgets that he himself is
subject to the four defects of nature: he is sure to commit mistakes,
his senses are imperfect, he is sure to fall into illusion, and he is cheating.
Unless one has perfect knowledge from disciplic succession, he simply
puts forth some theories of his own creation; therefore he is cheating
people. Jitana means knowledge received through disciplic succession
from the scriptures, and vijigna means practical application of such
knowledge. Kapila Muni’s sarkhya system of philosophy is based on
jiiana and vijiiana.

--- Page 289 ---
Text 19] The Renunciation of Kardama Muni 969
PURPORT

Here the word avidya is very significant. Avidyd means forgetfulness of
one’s identity. Every one of us is a spirit soul, but we have forgotten. We
think, “I am this body.” This is called avidya. Sarhsaya-granthi means
doubtfulness. The knot of doubtfulness is tied when the soul identifies
with the material world. That knot is also called ahankara, the junction of
matter and spirit. By proper knowledge received from the scriptures in
disciplic succession and by proper application of that knowledge, one can
free himself from this binding combination of matter and spirit. Brahma
assures Devahati that her son will enlighten her, and after enlightening her
He will travel all over the world, distributing the system of sankhya
philosophy.

The word sarisaya means doubtful knowledge. Speculative and pseudo
yogic knowledge is all doubtful. At the present moment the so-called yoga
system is prosecuted on the understanding that by agitation of the different
stations of the bodily construction one can find that he is God. The
mental speculators think similarly, but they are all doubtful. Real knowl-
edge is expounded in Bhagavad-gita: *‘Just become Krsna conscious. Just
worship Krsna and become a devotee of Krsna.” That is real knowledge,
and anyone who follows that system becomes perfect without a doubt.

PURPORT
Sankhya philosophy is the philosophical system enunciated by Kapila,
the son of Devahiiti. The other Kapila, who is not the son of Devahiti, is
an imitation. This is the statement of Brahma, and because we belong to
Brahma’s disciplic succession we should accept his statement that the real
Kapila is the son of Devahiiti and that real sarikhya philosophy is the
system of philosophy which He introduced and which will be accepted by
the acaryas, the directors of spiritual discipline. The word susammata
means accepted by persons who are counted upon to give their good
opinion.

Text 21] The Renunciation of Kardama Muni 971
PURPORT

The words hamsena ydnena are very significant here. Hamsa-yana,
the airplane by which Brahma travels all over outer space, resembles a
swan. Brahma is also known as Hamsa because he can grasp the essence of
everything. His abode is called tri-dhama paramam. There are three
divisions of the universe—the upper planetary system, the middle planetary
system and the lower planetary system—but his abode is above even
Siddhaloka, the upper planetary system. He returned to his own planet
with the four Kumaras and Narada because they were not going to be
married. The other rsis who came with him, such as Marici and Atri,
remained there because they were to be married to the daughters of
Kardama, but his other sons, Sanat, Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanatana and
Narada, went back with him in his swan-shaped airplane. The four Kumaras
and Narada .are naisthika-brahmacaris. Naisthika-brahmacari means one
who never wastes his semina at any time. They were not to attend the
marriage ceremony of their other brothers, Marici and the other sages, and
therefore they went back with their father, Hamsa.

sah—the sage Kardama; ca—and; avatirpam—descended; tri-yugam—
Vignu; @jiiaya—having understood; vibudha-ysabham—the chief of the
demigods; vivikte—in a secluded place; upasarigamya—having approached;
pranamya—offering obeisances; samabhasata—he spoke.

TRANSLATION

When Kardama Muni understood that the Supreme Personality of God-
head, the chief of all the demigods, Vignu, had descended, he approached
Him in a secluded place, offered obeisances, and spoke as follows.

PURPORT

Lord Vignu is called tri-yuga. He appears in three yugas, Satya, Treta,
Dvapara—but in Kali-yuga He does not appear. From the prayers of
Prahlada Maharaja, however, we understand that He appears garbed as a
devotee in Kali-yuga. Lord Caitanya is that devotee. Krgna appeared in the
form of a devotee, but although He never disclosed Himself, Rupa Gosvami
could understand His identity, for the Lord cannot hide Himself from a
pure devotee. Ripa Gosvami detected Him when he offered his first
obeisances to Lord Caitanya. He knew that He was Krsna Himself and
therefore offered his obeisances with the following words: “I offer my
respects to Krsna, who has now appeared as Lord Caitanya.”” This is also
confirmed in the prayers of Prahlada Maharaja: in Kali-yuga He does not
directly appear, but He appears as a devotee. Visnu, therefore, is known as
tri-yuga. Another explanation of tri-yuga is that He has three pairs of
divine attributes, namely power and affluence, piety and renown, and
wisdom and dispassion. According to Sridhara Svami, His three pairs of
opulences are complete riches and complete strength, complete fame and
complete beauty, and complete wisdom and complete renunciation. There
are different interpretations of tri-yugoe, but it is accepted by all learned
scholars that tri-yuga means Vignu. When Kardama Muni understood that
His son Kapila was 19100 Himself, he wanted to offer his obeisances.
Therefore, when Kapila was alone he offered his respects and expressed
his mind as follows.

the hellish material entanglement; svaih—their own; amangalaih—by mis-
deeds; kalena bhiiyasi—after a long time; ninam—indeed; prasidanti—they

TRANSLATION
Kardama Muni said: Oh, after a long time the demigods of this universe
have become pleased with the suffering souls who are in material entangle-
ment because of their own misdeeds.
PURPORT
This material world is a place for suffering, which is due to the misdeeds
of the inhabitants, the conditioned souls themselves. The sufferings are
not extraneously imposed upon them; rather, they create their own suffer-
ing by their own acts. In the forest, fire takes place automatically. It is not
that someone has to go there and set a fire, but because of friction among
various trees, fire occurs automatically. When there is too much heat from
the forest fire of this material world, the demigods, including Brahma
himself, being harassed, approach the Supreme Lord, the Supreme Person-
ality of Godhead, and appeal to Him to alleviate the condition. Then the
Supreme Personality of Godhead descends. In other words, when the
demigods become distressed by the sufferings of the conditioned souls,
they approach the Lord to remedy the suffering, and the Personality of
Godhead descends. When the Lord descends, all the demigods become
enlivened. Therefore Kardama Muni said, “After many, many years of
human suffering all the demigods are now satisfied because Kapiladeva,
the incarnation of Godhead, has appeared.”

TRANSLATION

After many births, mature yogis, by complete trance in yoga, endeavor
in secluded places to see the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of God-
head.

PURPORT

Some important things are mentioned here about yoga. The word bahu-
Janma-vipakvena means after many, many births of mature yoga practice.
And another word, samyag-yoga-samadhina, means by complete practice of
the yoga system. Complete practice of yoga means bhakti-yoga; unless
one comes to the point of bhakti-yoga, or surrender unto the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, one’s yoga practice is not complete. This same
point is corroborated in the Srimad Bhagavad-gitd. Bahiindriv janmanam
ante: after many, many births, the jiani who has matured in transcen-
dental knowledge surrenders unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Kardama Muni repeats the same statement: After many, many years and
many, many births of complete practice of yoga, one can see the lotus
feet of the Supreme Lord in a secluded place. It is not that after one
practices some sitting postures he immediately becomes perfect. One has
to perform yoga a long time—*many, many births” —to become mature,
and a yogi has to practice in a secluded place. One cannot practice yoga in
a city or in a public park and declare that he has become God simply by
some exchange of dollars. This is all bogus propaganda. Those who are
actually yogis practice in a secluded place, and after many, many births
they become successful, provided they surrender unto the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, which is the completion of yoga.

low; nah—our; grhesu—in the houses; jatah—appeared; gramyanam—of or-

TRANSLATION

Not considering the negligence of ordinary householders like us, that very
same Supreme Personality of Godhead appears in our homes just to support
His devotees.

PURPORT

Devotees are so affectionate towards the Personality of Godhead that
although He does not appear before those who practice yoga in a secluded
place even for many, many births, He agrees to appear in a householder’s
home where devotees engage in devotional service without material yoga
practice. In other words, devotional service to the Lord is so easy that even
a householder can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead as one of the
members of his household, as his son, as Kardama Muni experienced. He
was a householder, although a yogi, but he had the incarnation of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kapila Muni, as his son.

Devotional service is such a powerful transcendental method that it
surpasses all other methods of transcendental realization. The Lord says,
therefore, that He lives neither in Vaikuntha nor in the heart of a yogi, but
He lives where His pure devotees are always chanting and glorifying Him.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is known as bhakta-vatsala. He is
never described as jiiani-vatsala or yogi-vatsala. He is always described as
bhakta-vatsala because He is more inclined towards His devotees than
towards other transcendentalists. In Bhagavad-gita it is confirmed that
only a devotee can understand Him as He is. Bhaktya mam abhijanati:
“One can understand Me only by devotional service, not otherwise.” That
understanding alone is real because although jianis, mental speculators,
can realize only the effulgence or the bodily luster of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, and yogis can realize only the partial representa-
tion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, a bhakta not only realizes


--- Page 298 ---
978 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 24
Him as He is, but he also associates with the Personality of Godhead face
to face.

TRANSLATION

Kardama Muni said: My dear Lord, You, who are always increasing the
honor of Your devotees, have descended in my home just to fulfill Your
word and disseminate the process of real knowledge.

PURPORT

When the Lord appeared before Kardama Muni after his mature yoga
practice, He promised that Ile would become his son. He descended as the
son of Kardama Muni in order to fulfill that promise. Another purpose of
His appearance is cikirsur bhagavan jianam, to distribute knowledge. There-
fore, He is called bhaktanam mana-vardhanah, He who increases the honor of
His devotees. By distributing sarikhya He would increase the honor of the de-
votees; therefore, sainkhya philosophy isnot dry mental speculation. ৩৫7/0/ ৫
philosophy means devotional service. How could the honor of the devotees
be increased unless saikhya were meant for devotional service? Devotees
are not interested in speculative knowledge; therefore, the sankhya
enunciated by Kapila Muni is meant to establish one firmly in devotional
service. Real knowledge and real liberation is to surrender unto the
Supreme Personality of Godhead and engage in devotional service.

TRANSLATION
My dear Lord, although You have no material form, You have Your

are pleasing to Your devotees.
PURPORT
In the Brahma-samhita it is stated that the Lord is one Absolute, but He
has ananta, or innumerable, forms. Advaitam acyutam anadim ananta-
riipam. The Lord is the original form, but still lle has multi-forms. Those
multi-forms are manifested by lim transcendentally, according to the
tastes of lis rulti-devotees. It is understood that once Hanuman, the
great devotee of Lord Ramacandra, said that he knew that Narayana, the
husband of Laksmi, and Rama, the husband of Sita, are one and the same,
and that there is no difference between Laksmi and Sita, but as for himself,
he liked the form of Lord Rama. In a similar way, some devotees worship
the original form of Krgna. When we say Krsna we refer to all forms of the
Lord—not only Krsna, but Rama, Nrsimha, Varaha, Narayana, etc. The
varieties of transcendental forms exist simultaneously. That is also stated
in the Brahma-samhita: ramadi-mirtisu. . .nanavataram. He already exists
in multi-forms, but none of the forms are material. Sridhara Svami has
commented that aripinah, without form, means without material form.
The Lord has form, otherwise how can it be stated here, tany eva te ‘bhiri-
pani ripani bhagavars tava: “You have Your forms, but they are not ma-
terial. Materially You have no form, but spiritually, transcendentally, You
have multi-forms”? Mayavadi philosophers cannot understand these tran-


--- Page 300 ---
980 Srimad-Bhagavatam [ Canto 3, Ch. 24
scendental forms of the Lord, and, being disappointed, they say that the
Supreme Lord is impersonal. But that is not a fact; whenever there is form
there is a person. Many times in many Vedic literatures the Lord is
described as purusa, which means the original form, the original enjoyer.
The conclusion is that the Lord has no material form, and yet, according
to the liking of different grades of devotees, 116 simultaneously exists in
multi-forms, such as Rama, Nrsimha, Varaha, Narayana and Mukunda.
There are many thousands and thousands of forms, but they are all visnu-
tattva, Krsna.

knowledge, strength and beauty, and therefore I surrender myself unto
Your lotus feet.
PURPORT
Actually, those who are searching after the Absolute Truth must take
shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and
worship Him. In Bhagavad-gita Lord Krsna advised Arjuna many times to


--- Page 301 ---
Text 33] The Renunciation of Kardama Muni 981
surrender unto Him, especially at the end of the Ninth Chapter—man-mana
bhava mad-bhaktah: “11 you want to be perfect, just always think of Me,
become My devotee, worship Me, and offer your obeisances to Me. In this
way you will understand Me, the Personality of Godhead, and ultimately
you will come back to Me, back to Godhead, back home.” Why is it so?
The Lord is always full in six opulences, as mentioned herein: wealth,
renunciation, fame, knowledge, strength and beauty. The word pirtam
means in full. No one can claim that all wealth belongs to him, but Krsna
can claim it, since He has full wealth. Similarly, He is full in knowledge,
renunciation, strength and beauty. He is full in everything, and no one can
surpass Him. Another one of Krgna’s names is asamaurdhva, which means
that no one is equal to or greater than Him.

--- Page 302 ---
982 Srimad-Bhagavatam [ Canto 3, Ch. 24
three modes of material nature, and who absorbs the material manifestations
after their dissolution.

PURPCRT

The six opulences—wealth, strength, fame, beauty, knowledge and
renunciation—are indicated here by Kardama Muni, who addresses Kapila
Muni, his son, as puram. The word param is used in the beginning of
Srimad-Bhagavatam, in the phrase [00701 satyam, to refer to the summum
bonum or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Param is explained further
by the next word, pradhanam, which means the chief, the origin, the source
of everything—sarva-karana-karanam—the cause of all causes. The Supreme
Personality of Godhead is not formless; He is purusam, or the enjoyer, the
original person. He is the time element and is all-cognizant. He knows
everything—past, present and future—as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita. The
Lord says, “I know everything, present, past and future, in every corner of
the universe.” The material world, which is moving under the spell of the
three modes of nature, is also a manifestation of His energy. Parasya $aktir
vividhaiva $riyate: everything that we see is an interaction of His energies
(Svet. Up. 6.8). Parasya brahmanah $aktis tathedam akhilarn jagat. Thisis the
version of the Visnu Purana. We can understand that whatever we see is an
interaction of the three modes of material nature, but actually it is all an
interaction of the Lords energy. Loka-palam: He is actually the main-
tainer of all living entities. Nityo nityanam: He is the chief of all living
entities; He is one, but He maintains many, many living entities. God
maintains all other living entities, but nc one can maintain God. That is
His svacchanda-$akti; He is not dependent on others. Someone may call
himself independent, but he is still dependent on someone higher. The
Personality of Godhead, however, is absolute; there is no one higher than
or equal to Him.

Kapila Muni appeared as the son of Kardama Muni, but because He is
an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kardama Muni
offered his respectful obeisances unto Him with full surrender. Another
word in this verse is very important: atmanubhityanugata-prapaficam.
The Lord descends either as Kapila or Rama, Nrsimha or Varaha, and
whatever forms He assumes in the material world are all manifestations of
His own personal internal energy. They are never the forms of the material
energy. The ordinary living entities who are manifested in this material
world have bodies created by the material energy, but when Krsna or any
one of His expansions or parts of the expansions descends on this material
world, although He appears to have a material body, His body is not
material. He always has a transcendental body. But fools and rascals, who


--- Page 303 ---
Text 34] The Renunciation of Kardama Muni 983
are called midhas, consider Him one of them, and therefore they deride
Him. They refuse to accept Krsna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead
because they cannot understand Him. In Bhagavad-gita Krsna says, avajan-
anti mam mudhah: “Those who are rascals and fools deride Me.” When
God descends in a form, this does not mean that He assumes His form
with the help of the material energy. He manifests His spiritual form as He
exists in His spiritual kingdom.

an itinerant mendicant. Renouncing this family life, I wish to wander about,
free from lamentation, thinking always of You in my heart.
PURPORT
Actually, sannydasa, or renunciation of material household life, necessi-
tates complete absorption in Krsna consciousness and immersion in the
Self. One does not take sannyasa, freedom from family responsibility in
the renounced order of life, to make another family or to create an


--- Page 304 ---
984 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 24
embarrassing transcendental fraud in the name of sannyasa. The sannyasi’s
business is not to become proprietor of so many things and amass money
from the innocent public. A sannyasi is proud that he is always thinking of
Krsna within himself. Of course, there are two kinds of devotees of the
Lord. One is called gosthyanandi, which means those who are preachers
and have many followers for preaching the glories of the Lord and who
live amongst those many, many followers just to organize missionary
activities. Other devotees are atmanandi, or self-satisfied, and do not take
the risk of preaching work. They remain, therefore, alone with God. In
this classification was Kardama Muni. He wanted to be free from all
anxieties and remain alone within his heart with the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. Parivraja means an itinerant mendicant. A mendicant sannyasi
should not live anywhere for more than three days. He must be always
moving because his duty is to move from door to door and enlighten
people about Krsna consciousness.

--- Page 305 ---
Text 35] The Renunciation of Kardama Muni 985
PURPORT

Kardama Muni was to leave his family life to completely engage in the
service of the Lord. But.since he knew that the Lord Himself, as Kapila,
had taken birth in his home as his own son, why was he preparing to leave
home to search out self-realization or God realization? God Himself was
present in his home—why should he leave home? Such a question may
certainly arise. But here it is said that whatever is spoken in the Vedas and
whatever is practiced in accordance with the injunctions of the Vedas is to
be accepted as authoritative in society. Vedic authority says that a house-
holder must leave home after his fiftieth year. Paiicasordhvam vanam vrajet:
one must leave his family life and enter the forest after the age of fifty.
This is an authoritative statement of the Vedas, based on the division of
social life into four departments of activity—brahmacarya, grhastha, vana-
prastha and sannydsa.

Kardama Muni practiced yoga very rigidly as a brahmacari before his
marriage, and he became so powerful and attained so much mystic power
that his father, Brahma, ordered him to marry and beget children as a
householder. Kardama did that also; he begot nine good daughters and
one son, Kapila Muni, and thus his householder duty was also performed
nicely, and now his duty was to leave. Even though he had the Supreme
Personality of Godhead as his son, he had to respect the authority of the
Vedas. This is a very important lesson. Even if one has God in his home as
his son, he should still follow the Vedic injunctions. It is stated,
mahdjano yena gatah sa panthah: one should traverse the path which
is followed by great personalities.

Kardama Muni’s example is very instructive, for in spite of having the
Supreme Personality of Godhead as his son, he left home just to obey the
authority of the Vedic injunction. Kardama Muni states here the main
purpose of his leaving home: while traveling all over the world as a
mendicant, he would always remember the Supreme Personality of God-
head within his heart and thereby be freed from all the anxieties of material
existence. In this age of Kali-yuga sannydsa is prohibited because persons
in this age are all $iidras and cannot follow the rules and regulations of
sannyasa life. It is very commonly found that so-called sannyasis are
addicted to nonsense—even {०७ having private relationships with women.
This is the abominable situation in this age. Although they dress themselves
as sannyasis, they still cannot free themselves from the four principles of
sinful life, namely illicit sex life, meat eating, intoxication and gambling.
Since they are not freed from these four principles, they are cheating the
public by posing as svamis.


--- Page 306 ---
986 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 24

In Kali-yuga the injunction is that no one should accept sannyasa. Of
course, those who actually foliow the rules and regulations must take
sannydsa. Generally, however, people are unable to accept sannyasa life,
and therefore Cailanya Mahaprabhu stressed, kalau nasty eva nasty eva
nasty eva gatir anyatha. In this age there is no other alternative, no other
alternative, no other alternative than to chant the holy name of the Lord,
Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare. The main purpose of
sannyasa life is to be in constant companionship with the Supreme Lord,
either by thinking of Him within the heart or hearing of Him through
aural reception. In this age, hearing is more important than thinking
because one’s thinking may be disturbed by mental agitation, but if one
concentrates on hearing, he will be forced to associate with the sound
vibration of Krsna. Krsna and the sound vibration Krsna are nondifferent,
so if one loudly vibrates Hare Krsna, he will be able to think of Krsna
immediately. This process of chanting is the best process of self-realization
in this age; therefore Lord Caitanya preached it so nicely for the benefit
of all humanity.

sanikhya, which is highly esteemed for self-realization by those desiring
freedom from the entanglement of unnecessary material desires.

Text 37] The Renunciation of Kardama Muni 987
PURPORT

Here the word durasayat is very significant. Dur means trouble or
duhkha, miseries. Asayat means from the shelter. We conditioned souls
have taken shelter of the material body, which is full of troubles and
miseries. Foolish people cannot understand the situation, and this is called
ignorance, illusion, or the spell of maya. Human society should very
seriously understand that the body itself is the source of all miserable life.
Modern civilization is supposed to be making advancement in scientific
knowledge, but what is this scientific knowledge? It is based on bodily
comforts only, without knowledge that however comfortably one main-
tains his body, the body is destructible. As stated in Bhagavad-gita,
antavanta ime dehah: these bodies are destined to be destroyed. Nityasyok-
tah Saririnah refers to the living soul or the living spark which is within the
body. That soul is eternal, but the body is not eternal. For our activity we
must have a body; without a body, without sense organs, there is no activity.
But people are not inquiring whether it is possible to have an eternal body.
Actually they aspire for an eternal body because even though they engage
in sense enjoyment, that sense enjoyment is not eternal. They are there-
fore in want of something which they can enjoy eternally, but they do not
understand how to attain that perfection. Saitkhya philosophy, therefore,
as stated herein by Kapiladeva, is tattvanam. The sankhya philosophy
system is designed to afford understanding of the real truth. What is that
real truth? The real truth is knowledge of how to get out of the material
body, which is the source of all trouble. Lord Kapila’s incarnation or

descent is especially meant for this purpose. That is clearly stated here.

TRANSLATION

This path of self-realization, which is difficult to understand, has now
been lost in the course of time. Please know that I have assumed this body
of Kapila to introduce and explain this philosphy to human society again.

PURPORT

It is not true that sankhya philosophy is a new system of philosophy
introduced by Kapila as material philosophers introduce new kinds of
mental speculative thought to supersede that of another philosopher. On
the material platform everyone, especially the mental speculator, tries to
be more prominent than others. The field of activity of the speculators is
the mind; there is no limit to the different ways in which one can agitate
the mind. The mind can be unlimitedly agitated, and thus one can put
forward an unlimited number of theories. Sankhya philosophy is not like
that; it is not mental speculation. It is factual, but at the time of Kapila it
was lost.

In due course of time, a particular type of knowledge may be lost or may
be covered for the time being; that is the nature of this material world. A simi-
lar statement was made by Lord Krsna in Bhagavad-gita. Sa kaleneha mahata
yogo nastah: “In course of time the yoga system as stated in Bhagavad-
gita was lost.” It was coming in parampard, in disciplic succession, but due
to the passage of time it was lost. The time factor is so pressing that in the
course of time everything within this material world is spoiled or lost.
The yoga system of Bhagavad-gita was lost before the meeting of Krsna
and Arjuna. Therefore Krsna again enunciated the same ancient yoga
system to Arjuna, who could actually understand Bhagavad-gita. Similar-
ly, Kapila also said that the system of sankhya philosophy was not exactly
being introduced by Him; it was already current, but in course of time it
was mysteriously lost, and therefore He appeared to reintroduce it. That
is the purpose of the incarnation of Godhead. Yada yada hi dharmasya
glanir bhavati bharata. Dharma means the real occupation of the living
entity. When there is a discrepancy in the eternal occupation of the living
entity, the Lord comes and introduces the real occupation of life. Any so-
called religious system that is not in the line of devotional service is called
adharma-saritsthapana. When people forget their eternal relationship with
God and engage in something other than devotional service, that is called


--- Page 309 ---
Text 38] The Renunciation of Kardama Muni 989
irreligion. How one can get out of the miserable condition of material life
is stated in sarikhya philosophy, and the Lord Himself is explaining this
sublime system.

votional service.

TRANSLATION

Now, being sanctioned by Me, go as you desire, surrendering all your
activities to Me. Conquering insurmountable death, worship Me for eternal
life.

PURPORT

The purpose of sarikhya philosophy is stated herein. If anyone wants
real eternal life, he has to engage himself in devotional service or Krsna
consciousness. To become free from birth and death is not an easy task.
Birth and death are natural to this material body. Sudurjayam means very,
very difficult to overcome. The modern so-called scientists have no sufficient
means to understand the process of victory over birth and death. Therefore,
they set aside the question of birth and death; they do not consider it.
They simply engage in the problems of the material body, which is tran-
sient and sure to end.

Actually, human life is meant for conquering the insurmountable process
of birth and death. That can be done as stated here. Mari bhaja: one must
engage in the devotional service of the Lord. In Bhagavad-gita also the
Lord says, man-mana bhava mad-bhaktah: “Just become My devotee. Just
worship Me.” But foolish so-called scholars say that it is not Krsna whom
we must worship and to whom we must surrender; it is something else.


--- Page 310 ---
990 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 24
Without Krsna’s mercy, therefore, no one can understand the saikhya
philosophy or any philosophy which is especially meant for liberation.
Vedic knowledge confirms that one becomes entangled in this material
life because of ignorance, and one can become free from material embar-
rassment by becoming situated in factual knowledge. Sarikhya means that
factual knowledge by which one can get out of the material entanglement.

Always, in your own heart, through your intellect, seeing Me, the su-

PURPORT
People are very anxious to understand the Absolute Truth in various
ways, especially by experiencing the brahmajyoti, or Brahman effulgence,
by meditation and by mental speculation. But Kapiladeva uses the word
mam to emphasize that the Personality of Godhead is the ultimate feature
of the Absolute Truth. In Bhagavad-gita the Personality of Godhead always
says mam, ‘unto Me,” but the rascals misinterpret the clear meaning. Mam
is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If one can see the Supreme
Personality of Godhead as He appears in different incarnations and under-
stand that He has not assumed a material body but is present in His own


--- Page 311 ---
Text 40] The Renunciation of Kardama Muni 991
eternal, spiritual form, then he can understand the nature of the Personality
of Godhead. Since the less intelligent cannot understand this point, it is
stressed everywhere again and again. Simply by seeing the form of the
Lord as He presents Himself by His own internal potency as Krsna or Rama
or Kapila, one can directly see the brahmajyoti because the brahmajyoti is
no more than the effulgence of His bodily luster. Since the sunshine is the
luster of the sun planet, by seeing the sun one automatically sees the sun-
shine; similarly, by seeing the Supreme Personality of Godhead one
simultaneously sees and experiences the Paramatma feature as well as the
impersonal Brahman feature of the Supreme.

The Bhagavatam has already enunciated that the Absolute Truth is
present in three features—in the beginning as the impersonal Brahman,
in the next stage as the Paramatma in everyone’s heart, and, at last,
as the ultimate realization of the Absolute Truth, Bhagavan, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. One who sees the Supreme Person can auto-
matically realize the other features, namely the Paramatma and Brahman
features of the Lord. The words used here are visoko ‘bhayam rcchasi.
Simply by seeing the Personality of Godhead one realizes everything, and
the result is that he becomes situated on the platform where there is no
lamentation and no fear. This can be attained simply by devotional service
to the Personality of Godhead.

ending all reactions to fruitive activities. Thus she also will be freed from
all material fear.

PURPORT

Kardama Muni was anxious about his good wife, Devahiti, while leaving
home, and so the worthy son promised that not only would Kardama
Muni be freed from the material entanglement, but Devahiiti would also be
freed by receiving instruction from her son. A very good example is set
here: the husband goes away, taking the sannydsa order for self-realization,
but his representative, the son, who is equally educated, remains at home
to deliver the mother. A sannyadst is not supposed to take his wife with him.
At the vanaprastha stage of retired life, or the stage midway between
householder life and renounced life, one may keep his wife as an assistant
without sex relations, but in the sannydsa order of life one cannot keep
his wife with him. Otherwise, a person like Kardama Muni could have kept
his wife with him, and there would have been no hindrance to his prose-
cution of self-realization.

Kardama Muni followed the Vedic injunction that no one in sannyasa
life can have any kind of relationship with women. But what is the position
of a woman who is left by her husband? She is entrusted to the son, and
the son promises that he will deliver his mother from entanglement. A
woman is not supposed to take sannydsa. So-called spiritual societies con-
cocted in modern times give sannydsa even to women, although there is no
sanction in the Vedic literature for a woman's accepting sannydsa.
Otherwise, if it were sanctioned, Kardama Muni could have taken his wife
and given her sannyasa. The woman must remain at home. She has only
three stages of life: dependency on the father in childhood, dependency on
the husband in youth, and, in old age, dependency on the grown-up son,
such as Kapila. In old age the progress of women depends on the grown-up
son. The ideal son, Kapila Muni, is assuring His father of the deliverance of
His mother so that His father may go peacefully without anxiety for his
good wife.

TRANSLATION

Set Maitreya said: Thus when Kardama Muni, the progenitor of human
society, was spoken to in fullness by his son, Kapila, he circumambulated
Him, and with a good, pacified mind he at once left for the forest.

PURPORT

Going to the forest is compulsory for everyone. It is not a mental excur-
sion upon which one person goes and another does not. Everyone should go
to the forest at least as a vdnaprastha. Forest-going means to take one hun-
dred percent shelter of the Supreme Lord, as explained by Prahlada Maharaja
in his talks with his father (91৫8. 7.5.5). Sada samudvigna-dhiyam. People
who have accepted a temporary material body are always full of anxieties.
One should not, therefore, be very much affected by this material body, but
should try to be freed. The preliminary process to become freed is to go to
the forest or give up family relationships and exclusively engage in Krsna
consciousness. That is the purpose of going to the forest. Otherwise, the
forest is only a place of monkeys and wild animals. To go to the forest
does not mean to become a monkey or a ferocious animal. It means to
accept exclusively the shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and
engage oneself in full service. One does not actually have to go to the forest.
At the present moment this is not at all advisable for a man who has spent
his life all along in big cities. As explained by Prahlada Maharaja (hitvatma-
[00077 grham andha-kiipam), one should not remain always engaged in the
responsibilities of family life because family life without Krsna conscious-
ness is just like a blind well. Alone in a field, if one falls into a blind well
and no one is there to save him, he may cry for years, and no one will see
or hear where the crying is coming from. Death is sure. Similarly, those
who are forgetful of their eternal relationship with the Supreme Lord are
in the blind well of family life; their position is very ominous. Prahlada
Maharaja advised that one should give up this well somehow or other and
take to Krsna consciousness and thus be freed from material entanglement,
which is full of anxieties.

vratam—vow; safi—he (Kardama); asthitah—accepted; maunam—silence;
atma—by the Supreme Personality of Godhead; eka—exclusively; sarapah—
being sheltered; munih—the sage; nihsangah—without association;
vyacarat—he traveled; ksonim—the earth; anagnih—without fire;
aniketanah—without shelter.
TRANSLATION
The sage Kardama Muni accepted silence as a vow in order to think of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead and take shelter of Him exclusively.
Without association, he traveled over the surface of the globe as a sannyasi,
devoid of any relationship with fire or shelter.
PURPORT

Here the words anagnir aniketanah are very significant. A sannyasi should
be completely detached from fire and any residential quarters. A grhastha
has a relationship with fire, either for offering sacrifices or for cooking, but
asannyasi is freed from these two responsibilities. He does not have to cook
or offer fire forsacrifice because he is always engaged in Krsna consciousness;
therefore he has already accomplished all ritualistic performances of
religion. Aniketanah means without lodging. He should not have his own
house, but should depend completely on the Supreme Lord for his food
and lodging. He should travel.

Mauna means silence. Unless one becomes silent, he cannot think com-
pletely about the pastimes and activities of the Lord. It is not that because
one is a fool and cannot speak nicely he therefore takes the vow of mauna.
Rather, one becomes silent so that people will not disturb him. It is said
by Canakya Pandita that a rascal appears very intelligent as long as he does
not speak. But speaking is the test. The so-called silence of a silent imper-
sonalist svami indicates that he has nothing to say; he simply wants to beg.


--- Page 315 ---
Text 43] The Renunciation of Kardama Muni 995
But the silence adopted by Kardama Muni is not like that. He became
silent for relief from nonsensical talk. One is called a muni when he
remains grave and does not talk nonsense. Maharaja Ambarisa has set a
very good example; whenever he spoke, he spoke about the pastimes of the
Lord. Mauna necessitates refraining from nonsensical talking and engaging
the talking facility in the pastimes of the Lord. In that way one can chant and
hear about the Lord in order to perfect his life. ¥ratam means that one
should take a vow as explained in Bhagavad-gita, amanitvam adambhitvam,
without hankering for personal respect and without being proud of one’s
material position. Ahiriisd means not being violent. There are eighteen
processes for attaining knowledge and perfection, and, by his vow,
Kardama Muni adopted all the principles of self-realization.

TRANSLATION

He fixed his mind upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Parabrahman, who is beyond cause and effect, who manifests the three
modes of material nature, who is beyond those three modes, and who is
perceived only through unfailing devotional service.

PURPORT

Whenever there is bhakti, there must be three things present—the
devotee, the devotion and the Lord. Without these three, bhakta, bhakti
and bhagavdn, there is no meaning to the word bhakti. Kardama Muni
fixed his mind on the Supreme Brahman and realized Him through bhakti,


--- Page 316 ---
996 Srimad-Bhagavatam [ Canto 3, Ch. 24
or devotional service. This indicates that he fixed his mind on the personal
feature of the Lord because bhakti cannot be executed unless one has
realization of the personal feature of the Absolute Truth. Gundvabhase: He
is beyond the three modes of material nature, but it is due to Him that the
three modes of material nature are manifested. In other words, although
the material energy is an emanation of the Supreme Lord, He is not
affected, as we are, by the modes of material nature. We are conditioned
souls, but He is not affected, although the material nature has emanated
from Him. He is the supreme living entity and is never affected by maya,
but we are subordinate, minute living entities, prone to be affected by the
limitations of maya. If he is in constant contact with the Supreme Lord
by devotional service, the conditioned living entity also becomes freed
from the infection of maya. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita: sa gunan
samatityaitan. A person engaged in Krsna consciousness is at once
liberated from the influence of the three modes of material nature. In
other words, once the conditioned soul engages himself in devotional
service, he also becomes liberated like the Lord.

Thus he gradually became unaffected by the false ego of material identity
and became free from material affection. Undisturbed, equal to everyone,

--- Page 317 ---
Text 45] The Renunciation of Kardama Muni 997
PURPORT

When one’s mind is in full Krsna consciousness and one fully engages in
rendering devotional service to the Lord, he becomes just like an ocean
unagitated by waves. This very example is also cited in Bhagavad-gita:
one should become like the ocean. The ocean is filled by many thousands
of rivers, and clouds evaporate millions of tons of its water, yet the ocean
is the same unagitated ocean. The laws of nature may work, but if one is
fixed in devotional service at the lotus feet of the Lord, he is not agitated
because he is introspective. He does not look outside to material nature,
but he looks into the spiritual nature of his existence; with a sober mind,
he simply engages in the service of the Lord. Thus he realizes his own self
without false identification with matter and without affection for
material possessions. Such a great devotee is never in trouble with others
because he sees everyone from the platform of spiritual understanding; he
sees himself and others in the right perspective.

TRANSLATION

He thus became liberated from conditioned life and became self-situated
in transcendental devotional service to the Personality of Godhead,
Vasudeva, the omniscient Supersoul within everyone.

PURPORT

When one engages in the transcendental devotional service of the Lord

he becomes aware that his constitutional position, as an individual soul,


--- Page 318 ---
998 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 24
is to be eternally a servitor of the Supreme Lord, Vasudeva. Self-
realization does not mean that because the Supreme Soul and the
individual soul are both souls they are equal in every respect. The individ-
ual soul is prone to be conditioned, and the Supreme Soul is never
conditioned. When the conditioned soul realizes that he is subordinate
to the Supreme Soul, that is called labdhatma, self-realization, or mukta-
bandhana, freedom from material contamination. Material contamination
continues as long as one thinks that he is as good as the Supreme Lord or
is equal with Him. This condition is the last snare of maya. Maya always
influences the conditioned soul. Even after much meditation and
speculation, if one continues to think himself one with the Supreme
Lord, it is to be understood that he is still in the last snares of the spell
of maya.

The word parepa is very significant. Para means transcendental,
untinged by material contamination. When one is in full consciousness that
heis an eternal servant of the Lord, that 15 called para bhakti. If one has any
identification with material things and executes devotional service for
attainment of some material gain, that is viddhd bhakti, contaminated
bhakti. One can actually become liberated by execution of para bhakti.

Another word mentioned here is sarva-jiie. The Supersoul sitting within
the heart is all-cognizant. He knows. I may forget my past activities due
to the change of body, but because the Supreme Lord as Paramatma is
sitting with me, He knows everything; therefore the result of .my past
karma or past activities is awarded to me. I may forget, but He awards me
suffering or enjoyment for the misdeeds or good deeds of my past life.
One should not think that he is freed from reaction because he has for-
gotten the actions of his past life. Reactions will take place, and what
kind of reactions there will be is judged by the Supersoul, the witness.

He began to see that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is seated in
everyone's heart, and that everyone is existing on Him, because He is the

PURPORT
That everyone is existing on the Supreme Personality of Godhead does
not mean that everyone is also Godhead. This is also explained in
Bhagavad-gita: everything is resting on Him, the Supreme Lord, but that
does not mean that the Supreme Lord is also everywhere. This mysterious
position has to be understood by highly advanced devotees. There are three
kinds of devotees—the neophyte devotee, the intermediate devotee and
the advanced devotee. The neophyte devotee does not understand the tech-
niques of devotional science, but simply offers devotional service to the Deity
in the temple; the intermediate devotee understands who God is, who is a
devotee, who is a nondevotee and who is innocent, and he deals with such
persons differently. But a person who sees that the Lord is sitting as
Paramatma in everyone's heart and that everything is depending or existing
on the transcendental energy of the Supreme Lord is in the highest devo-
tional position.

TRANSLATION

Freed from all hatred and desire, Kardama Muni, being equal to everyone
because of discharging uncontaminated devotional service, ultimately at-
tained the path back to Godhead.

PURPORT

As stated in Bhagavad-gita, only by devotional service can one under-
stand the transcendental nature of the Supreme Lord and, after under-
standing Him perfectly in His transcendental position, enter into the
kingdom of God. The process of entering into the kingdom of God is tri-
pada-bhiiti-gati, or the path back home, back to Godhead, by which one
can attain the ultimate goal of life. Kardama Muni, by His perfect devo-
tional knowledge and service, achieved this ultimate goal, which is known
as bhagavati gatih.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Third Canto, Twenty-
fourth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “The Renunciation of
Kardama Muni.”
