Preface

We must know the present need of human society. And what is that
need? Human society is no longer bounded by geographical limits to par-
ticular countries or communities. Human society is broader than in the
Middle Ages, and the world tendency is toward one state or one ‘human
society. The ideals of spiritual communism, according to Srimad-
Bhagavatam, are based more or less on the oneness of the entire human
society, nay, on the entire energy of living beings. The need is felt by
great thinkers to make this a successful ideology. Srimad-Bhagavatam
will fill this need in human society. It begins, therefore, with the aphor-
ism of Vedanta philosophy (janmady asya yatah) to establish the ideal of
a common cause.

Human society, at the present moment, is not in the darkness of obli-
vion. It has made rapid progress in the field of material comforts, educa-
tion and economic development throughout the entire world. But there is
a pinprick somewhere in the social body at large, and therefore there are
large-scale quarrels, even over less important issues. There is need of a
clue as to how humanity can become one in peace, friendship and
prosperity with a common cause. Srimad-Bhagavatam will fill this need,
for it is a cultural presentation for the re-spiritualization of the entire
human society.

Srimad-Bhagavatam should be introduced also in the schools and col-
leges, for it is recommended by the great student devotee Prahlada
Maharaja in order to change the demonic face of society.

Disparity in human society is due to lack of principles in a godless
civilization. There is God, or the Almighty One, from whom everything
emanates, by whom everything is maintained and in whom everything is

merged to rest. Material science has tried to find the ultimate source of
creation very insufficiently, but it is a fact that there is one ultimate
source of everything that be. This ultimate source is explained rationally
and authoritatively in the beautiful Bhagavatam or Srimad-
Bhagavatam.

Srimad-Bhagavatam is the transcendental science not only for know-
ing the ultimate source of everything but also for knowing our relation
with Him and our duty towards perfection of the human society on the
basis of this perfect knowledge. It is powerful reading matter in the
Sanskrit language, and it is now rendered into English elaborately so that
simply by a careful reading one will know God perfectly well, so much so
that the reader will be sufficiently educated to defend himself from the
onslaught of atheists. Over and above this, the reader will be able to con-
vert others to accept God as a concrete principle.

Srimad-Bhagavatam begins with the definition of the ultimate source.
It is a bona fide commentary on the Vedanta-siitra by the same author,
Srila Vyasadeva, and gradually it develops into nine cantos up to the
highest state of God realization. The only qualification one needs to study
this great book of transcendental knowledge is to proceed step by step
cautiously and not jump forward haphazardly as with an ordinary
book. It should be gone through chapter by chapter, one after another.
The reading matter is so arranged with its original Sanskrit text, its
English transliteration, synonyms, translation and purports so that one is
sure to become a God realized soul at the end of finishing the first nine
cantos.

The Tenth Canto is distinct from the first nine cantos, because it deals
directly with the transcendental activities of the Personality of Godhead
Sri Krsna. One will be unable to capture the effects of the Tenth Canto
without going through the first nine cantos. The book is complete in
twelve cantos, each independent, but it is good for all to read them in
small installments one after another. p

I must admit my frailties in presenting Srimad-Bhagavatam, but still
I am hopeful of its good reception by the thinkers and leaders of society
on the strength of the following statement of Srimad-Bhagavatam.

“On the other hand, that literature which is full with descriptions of the
transcendental glories of the name, fame, form and pastimes of the
unlimited Supreme Lord is a transcendental creation meant to bring
about a revolution in the impious life of a misdirected civilization. Such
transcendental literatures, even though irregularly composed, are heard,
sung and accepted by purified men who are thoroughly honest.”

Introduction

“This Bhagavata Purana is as brilliant as the sun, and it has arisen
just after the departure of Lord Krsna to His own abode, accompanied by
religion, knowledge, etc. Persons who have lost their vision due to the
dense darkness of ignorance in the age of Kali shall get light from this
Purana.” (Srimad-Bhagavatam 1.3.43)

The timeless wisdom of India is expressed in the Vedas, ancient
Sanskrit texts that touch upon all fields of human knowledge. Originally
preserved through oral tradition, the Vedas were first put into writing
five thousand years ago by Srila Vyasadeva, the “literary incarnation of
God.” After compiling the Vedas, Vyasadeva set forth their essence in
the aphorisms known as Vedanta-sitras. Srimad-Bhagavatam is
Vyasadeva’s commentary on his own Vedanta-siitras. It was written in
the maturity of his spiritual life under the direction of Narada Muni, his
spiritual master. Referred to as “the ripened fruit of the tree of Vedic
literature,” Srimad-Bhagavatam is the most complete and authoritative
exposition of Vedic knowledge.

After compiling the Bhagavatam, Vyasa impressed the synopsis of it
upon his son, the sage Sukadeva Gosvami. Sukadeva Gosvami subse-
quently recited the entire Bhagavatam to Maharaja Pariksit in an assem-
bly of learned saints on the bank of the Ganges at Hastinapura (now
Delhi). Maharaja Pariksit was the emperor of the world and was a great
rajarsi (saintly king). Having received a warning that he would die
within a week, he renounced his entire kingdom and retired to the bank
of the Ganges to fast until death and receive spiritual enlightenment.
The Bhagavatam begins with Emperor Pariksit’s sober inquiry to
Sukadeva Gosvami:

“You are the spiritual master of great saints and
devotees. I am therefore begging you to show the
way of perfection for all persons, and especially for
one who is about to die. Please let me know what a
man should hear, chant, remember and worship,
and also what he should not do. Please explain all
this to me.”

xiii


--- Page 5 ---
xiv Srimad-Bhagavatam

Sukadeva Gosvami’s answer to this question, and numerous other
questions posed by Maharaja Pariksit, concerning everything from the
nature of the self to the origin of the universe, held the assembled sages
in rapt attention continuously for the seven days leading to the King’s
death. The sage Sata Gosvami, who was present on the bank of the
Ganges when Sukadeva Gosvami first recited Srimad-Bhagavatam, later
repeated the Bhagavatam before a gathering of sages in the forest of
Naimisaranya. Those sages, concerned about the spiritual welfare of the
people in general, had gathered to perform a long, continuous chain of
sacrifices to counteract the degrading influence of the incipient age of
Kali. In response to the sages’ request that he speak the essence of Vedic
wisdom, Sita Gosvami repeated from memory the entire eighteen thou-
sand verses of Srimad-Bhagavatam, as spoken by Sukadeva Gosvami to
Maharaja Pariksit. .

The reader of Srimad-Bhagavatam hears Sata Gosvami relate the
questions of Maharaja Pariksit and the answers of Sukadeva Gosvami.
Also, Sita Gosvami sometimes responds directly to questions put by
Saunaka Rsi, the spokesman for the sages gathered at Naimisaranya. One
therefore simultaneously hears two dialogues: one between Maharaja
Pariksit and Sukadeva Gosvami on the bank of the Ganges, and another
at Naimisaranya between Siita Gosvami and the sages at Naimisaranya
Forest, headed by Saunaka Rsi. Furthermore, while instructing King
Pariksit, Sukadeva Gosvami often relates historical episodes and gives
accounts of lengthy philosophical discussions between such great souls as
the saint Maitreya and his disciple Vidura. With this understanding of
the history of the Bhagavatam, the reader will easily be able to follow its
intermingling of dialogues and events from various sources. Since philo-
sophical wisdom, not chronological order, is most important in the text,
one need only be attentive to the subject matter of Srimad-Bhagavatam
to appreciate fully its profound message.

The translator of this edition compares the Bhdgavatam to sugar
candy —wherever you taste it, you will find it equally sweet and
relishable. Therefore, to taste the sweetness of the Bhagavatam, one may
begin by reading any of its volumes. After such an introductory taste,
however, the serious reader is best advised to go back to Volume One of
the First Canto and then proceed through the Bhagavatam, volume after
volume, in its natural order.

Introduction x

This edition of the Bhagavatam is the first complete English transla-
tion of this important text with an elaborate commentary, and it is the
first widely available to the English-speaking public. It is the product of
the scholarly and devotional effort of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhakti-
vedanta Swami Prabhupada, the world’s most distinguished teacher of
Indian religious and philosophical thought. His consummate Sanskrit
scholarship and intimate familiarity with Vedic culture and thought as
well as the modern way of life combine to reveal to the West a magnif-
cent exposition of this important classic.

Readers will find this work of value for many reasons. For those in-
terested in the classical roots of Indian civilization, it serves as a vast
reservoir of detailed information on virtually every one of its aspects.
For students of comparative philosophy and religion, the Bhagavatam
offers a penetrating view into the meaning of India’s profound spiritual
heritage. To sociologists and anthropologists, the Bhagavatam reveals the
practical workings of a peaceful and scientifically organized Vedic
culture, whose institutions were integrated on the basis of a highly
developed spiritual world view. Students of literature will discover the
Bhagavatam to be a masterpiece of majestic poetry. For students of psy-
chology, the text provides important perspectives on the nature of con-
sciousness, human behavior and the philosophical study of identity.
Finally, to those seeking spiritual insight, the Bhagavatam offers simple
and practical guidance for attainment of the highest self-knowledge and
realization of the Absolute Truth. The entire multivolume text, pre-
sented by the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, promises to occupy a significant
place in the intellectual, cultural and spiritual life of modern man for a
long time to come. .

PURPORT

After hearing about the activities of Prahlada Maharaja, a pure devo-
tee should be very anxious to follow in his footsteps, but such a devotee
might be disappointed, thinking that not every devotee can come to the
standard of Prahlada Maharaja. This is the nature of a pure devotee; he
always thinks himself to be the lowest, to be incompetent and un-
qualified. Thus after hearing the narration of Prahlada Maharaja's ac-
tivities, Maharaja Yudhisthira, who was on the same standard of
devotional service as Prahlada, might have been thinking of his own
humble position. Narada Muni, however, could understand Maharaja
Yudhisthira’s mind, and therefore he immediately encouraged him by
saying that the Pandavas were not less fortunate; they were as good as
Prahlada Maharaja because although Lord Nrsimhadeva appeared for
Prahlada, the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His original form as
Krsna was always living with the Pandavas. Although the Pandavas, be-
cause of the influence of Krsna’s yogamaya, could not think of their for-
tunate position, every saintly person, including the great sage Narada,
could understand it, and therefore they constantly visited Maharaja
Yudhisthira.

Any pure devotee who is constantly conscious of Krsna is naturally
very fortunate. The word nr-loke, meaning ‘‘within the material world,”
indicates that before the Pandavas there had been many, many devotees,
such as the descendants of the Yadu dynasty and Vasistha, Marici,
KasSyapa, Lord Brahma and Lord Siva, who were all extremely fortunate.
The Pandavas, however, were better than all of them because Krsna
Himself lived with them constantly. Narada Muni therefore specifically
mentioned that within this material world (nr-loke) the Pandavas were
the most fortunate.

from Krsna); mahat—by great personalities; vimrgya—searched for;
kaivalya—oneness; nirvana-sukha—of transcendental happiness;

dear; suhrt—well-wisher; vah—of you; khalu—indeed; matuleyah—

arhaniyah—worshipable (because He is the Supreme Personality of
Godhead); vidhi-krt— (yet He serves you as) an order carrier; guruh—
your supreme advisor; ca—as well.

TRANSLATION

The impersonal Brahman is Krsna Himself because Krsna is the
source of the impersonal Brahman. He is the origin of the tran-
scendental bliss sought by great saintly persons, yet He, the
Supreme Person, is your most dear friend and constant well-
wisher and is intimately related to you as the son of your maternal
uncle. Indeed, He is always like your body and soul. He is
worshipable, yet He acts as your servant and sometimes as your
spiritual master.

PURPORT

There is always a difference of opinion about the Absolute Truth. One
class of transcendentalists concludes that the Absolute Truth is imper-
sonal, and another class concludes that the Absolute Truth is a person. In
Bhagavad-gita, the Absolute Truth is accepted as the Supreme Person.
Indeed, that Supreme Person Himself, Lord Krsna, instructs in
Bhagavad-gita, brahmano hi pratisthaham, mattah paratarari nanyat.
“The impersonal Brahman is My partial manifestation, and there is no
truth superior to Me.” That same Krsna, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, acted as the supreme friend and relative of the Pandavas, and


--- Page 10 ---
4 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 10
sometimes He even acted as their servant by carrying a letter from the
Pandavas to Dhrtarastra and Duryodhana. Because Krsna was the well-.
wisher of the Pandavas, He also acted as guru by becoming the spiritual
master of Arjuna. Arjuna accepted Krsna as his spiritual master ($85%05
te "hari $adhi mah tvar prapannam), and Krsna sometimes chastised
him. For example, the Lord said, asocyan anvasocas tvarh prajia-
vadari$ ca bhasase: “While speaking learned words, you are mourning
for what is not worthy of grief.” The Lord also said, kutas tva kasmalam
idari visame samupasthitam: “My dear Arjuna, how have these im-
purities come upon ठप? Such was the intimate relationship between
the Pandavas and Krsna. In the same way, a pure devotee of the Lord is
always with Krsna through thick and thin; his way of life is Krsna. This
is the statement of the authority Sri Narada Muni.

head, Krsna. May the Lord, who is always worshiped as the protec-
tor of all devotees by great saints who observe vows of silence,
meditation, devotional service and renunciation, be pleased
with us.

PURPORT
The Absolute Truth is sought by different persons in different ways,
yet He remains inconceivable. Nonetheless, devotees like the Pandavas,
the gopis, the cowherd boys, Mother Yasoda, Nanda Maharaja and all the
inhabitants of Vrndavana do not need to practice conventional processes
of meditation to attain the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for He
remains with them through thick and thin. Therefore a saint like

Narada, understanding the difference between transcendentalists and
pure devotees, always prays that the Lord will be pleased with him.

PURPORT
The asuras are generally extremely powerful because of their mystic
yogic power. However, as Lord Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (6.47):


--- Page 17 ---
Text 60] Prahlada, the Best Among Exalted Devotees 11
yoginam api sarvesam
mad-gatenantaratmanda
sraddhavan bhajate yo mam
sa me yuktatamo matah
“Of all yogis, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping
Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in
yoga and is the highest of all.” The actual purpose of mystic yoga is to
concentrate one’s attention fully on the Personality of Godhead, Krsna,
and always think of Him (mad-gatenantaratmana). To attain such per-
fection, one must undergo a certain process — hatha-yoga—and through
this yoga system the practitioner achieves some uncommon mystic
power. The asuras, however, instead of becoming devotees of Krsna,
utilize this mystic power for their personal sense gratification. Maya
Danava, for example, is mentioned here as maha-yogi, a great mystic,
but his business was to help the asuras. Nowadays we are actually seeing
that there are some yogis who cater to the senses of materialists, and
.there are imposters who advertise themselves as God. Maya Danava was
such a person, a god among the demons, and he could perform some
wonderful feats, one of which is described here: he made a well filled
with nectar and dipped the asuras into that nectarean well. This nectar
was known as mrta-sanjivayitari, for it could bring a dead body to life.
Mrta-sanjivayitari is also an Ayur-vedic preparation. It is a kind of li-
quor that invigorates even a person on the verge of death.

providence. Thus he spoke to the demons, who were grievously
lamenting.

made by all kinds of living entities, but without the sanction of the
Supreme Lord they are futile.

with all the necessary paraphernalia, such as a chariot, a

‘When Lord Siva was fully equipped in this way, he sat down on the
chariot with his arrows and bow to fight with the demons.
PURPORT
As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (12.13.16): vaisnavanar yatha
sambhuh: Lord Siva is the best of the Vaisnavas, the devotees of Lord
Krsna. Indeed, he is one of the mahdjanas, the twelve authorities on
Vaisnava philosophy (svayambhir naradah sambhuh kumarah kapilo
manuh, etc.). Lord Krsna is always prepared to help all the mahajanas
and devotees in every respect (kaunteya pratijanihi na me bhaktah
pranasyati). Although Lord Siva is very powerful, he lost a battle to the
asuras, and therefore he was morose and disappointed. However, because
he is one of the chief devotees of the Lord, the Lord personally equipped
him with all the paraphernalia for war. The devotee, therefore, must
serve the Lord sincerely, and Krsna is always in the background to pro-
tect him and, if need be, to equip him fully to fight with his enemy. For
devotees there is no scarcity of knowledge or material requisites for
spreading the Krsna consciousness movement.

TRANSLATION

The Lord, Sri Krsna, appeared as a human being, yet He per-
formed many uncommon and wonderful pastimes by His own
potency. How can I say more about His activities than what has
already been said by great saintly persons? Everyone can be
purified by His activities, simply by hearing about them from the
right source.

PURPORT

Bhagavad-gita and all the Vedic literatures fully explain that the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, appears in human society as an
ordinary human being but acts very uncommonly for the well-being of
the entire world. One should not be influenced by the illusory energy and
think Lord Krsna to be an ordinary human being. Those who really seek
the Absolute Truth come to the understanding that Krsna is everything
(vasudevah sarvam iti). Such great souls are very rare. Nonetheless, if
one studies the entire Bhagavad-gitd as it is, Krsna is very easy to under-
stand. The Krsna consciousness movement is just trying to make Krsna
known all over the world as the Supreme Personality of Godhead (krsnas
tu bhagavin svayam). If people take this movement seriously, their lives
as human beings will be successful.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Seventh Canto, Tenth
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “Prahlada, the Best Among
Exalted Devotees.”

CHAPTER ELEVEN
The Perfect Society: Four Social Classes
This chapter describes the general principles by following which a
human being, and specifically one who is interested in advancing in
spiritual life, can become perfect.

By hearing about the characteristics of Prahlada Maharaja, Maharaja
Yudhisthira became extremely pleased. Now he inquired from Narada
Muni about the actual religion of a human being and about special
characteristics of varnasrama-dharma, which marks the highest status
of human civilization. When Maharaja Yudhisthira asked Narada Muni
about these matters, Narada Muni stopped giving his own statements and
quoted statements by Lord Narayana, for He is the supreme authority for
giving religious codes (dharmarh tu saksad bhagavat-pranitam). Every
human being is expected to acquire thirty qualities, such as truthfulness,
mercy and austerity. The process of following the principles of religion is
known as sanatana-dharma, the eternal religious system.

The varnasrama system delineates the divisions of brahmana,
ksatriya, vaiSya and Sidra. It also sets forth the system of sarmskaras.
The garbhadhana sariskara, the ceremony for begetting a child, must be
observed by the higher section of people, namely the dvijas. One who
follows the garbhadhana sariskara system is actually twiceborn, but
those who do not, who deviate from the principles of varnasrama-
dharma, are called dvija-bandhus. The principal occupations for a
brahmana are worshiping the Deity, teaching others how to worship the
Deity, studying the Vedic literatures, teaching the Vedic literatures, ac-
cepting charity from others and again giving charity to others. A
brahmana should make his livelihood from these six occupational duties.
The duty of a ksatriya is to give protection to the citizens and levy taxes
upon them, but he is forbidden to tax the brahmanas. The members of
the Krsna consciousness movement should therefore be exempt from
government taxation. Ksatriyas may tax everyone but the brahmanas.
Vaisyas should cultivate the land, produce food grains and protect the

21


--- Page 27 ---
22 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 11
cows, whereas the Sidras, who by quality never become brahmanas,
ksatriyas or waiSyas, should serve the three higher classes and be
satisfied. Other means of livelihood are also prescribed for the
brahmanas, and these are four—salina, yayavara, Sila, and urichana.
Each of these occupational duties is successively better.

One who is in a lower grade of social life cannot accept the profession
of a higher class unless necessary. In times of emergency, all the classes
but the ksatriyas may accept professional duties of others. The means of
livelihood known as rta (Silofichana), amrta (ayacita), mrta (yacia),
pramrta (karsana), and satyanrta (vanijya) may be accepted by every-
one but the ksatriyas. For a brahmana or a ksatriya, engaging in the ser-
vice of the vaiSyas or Sidras is considered the profession of dogs.

Narada Muni also described that the symptom of a brahmana is con-
trolled senses, the symptoms of a ksatriya are power and fame, the
symptom of a vaiSya is service to the brahmanas and ksatriyas, and the
symptom of a Sidra is service to the three higher classes. The qualifica-
tion for a woman is to be a very faithful and chaste wife. In this way,
Narada Muni described the characteristics of higher and lower grades of
people and recommended that one follow the principles of his caste or his
hereditary occupation. One cannot suddenly give up a profession to
which he is accustomed, and therefore it is recommended that one gradu-
ally be awakened. The symptoms of brahmanas, ksatriyas, vaiSyas, and
$adras are very important, and therefore one should be designated only
by these symptoms, and not by birth. Designation by birth is strictly for-
bidden by Narada Muni and all great personalities.

TRANSLATION

Maharaja Yudhisthira said: My dear lord, I wish to hear from
you about the principles of religion by which one can attain the
ultimate goal of life —devotional service. I wish to hear about the
general occupational duties of human society and the system of
social and spiritual advancement known as varnasrama-dharma.

PURPORT

Sanatana-dharma means devotional service. The word sanatana
refers to that which is eternal, which does not change but continues in all
circumstances. We have several times explained what the eternal occupa-
tional duty of the living being is. Indeed, it has been explained by Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Jivera ‘svaripa’ haya—krsnera ‘nitya-dasa’: the
real occupational duty of the living entity is to serve the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead. Even if one prefers to deviate from this principle he
remains a servant because that is his eternal position; but one serves
maya, the illusory, material energy. The Krsna consciousness move-
ment, therefore, is an attempt to guide human society to serving the Per-
sonality of Godhead instead of serving the material world with no real
profit. Our actual experience is that every man, animal, bird and beast—
indeed, every living entity—is engaged in rendering service. Even
though one’s body or one’s superficial religion may change, every living
entity is always engaged in the service of someone. Therefore, the men-
tality of service is called the eternal occupational duty. This eternal oc-
cupational duty can be organized through the institution of varndsrama,
in which there are four varnas (brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya and sidra)
and four asramas (brahmacarya, grhastha, vanaprastha and sannydsa).
Thus, Yudhisthira Maharaja inquired from Narada Muni about the prin-
ciples of sandtana-dharma for the benefit of human society.

principles of confidential religious life, and no one knows them
better than you.

PURPORT

Yudhisthira Maharaja knew that Narada Muni is the supreme spiritual
master of human society who can teach the path of spiritual liberation
leading to the understanding of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Actually, it is for this purpose that Narada Muni compiled his Bhakti-
sitra and gave directions in the Narada-paricaratra. To learn about
religious principles and the perfection of life, one must take instruction
from the disciplic succession of Narada Muni. Our Krsna consciousness
movement is directly in the line of the Brahma-sampradaya. Narada
Muni received instructions from Lord Brahma and in turn transmitted
the instructions to Vyasadeva. Vyasadeva instructed his son Sukadeva
Gosvami, who spoke Srimad-Bhagavatam. The Krsna consciousness
movement is based on Srimad-Bhagavatam and Bhagavad-gita. Because
Srimad-Bhagavatam was spoken by Sukadeva Gosvami and Bhagavad-
gita was spoken by Krsna, there is no difference between them. If we
strictly follow the principle of disciplic succession, we are certainly on
the right path of spiritual liberation, or eternal engagement in devotional
service.

TRANSLATION
The Supreme Being, the Personality of Godhead, is the essence
of all Vedic knowledge, the root of all religious principles, and the
memory of great authorities. O King Yudhisthira, this principle of
religion is to be understood as evidence. On the basis of this
religious principle, everything is satisfied, including one’s mind,
soul and even one’s body.

PURPORT

As stated by Yamaraja, dharmam tu saksad bhagavat-pranitam.
Yamaraja, the representative of the Lord who takes care of the living
beings after their death, gives his verdict as to how and when the living
being will change his body. He is the authority, and he says that the
religious principles consist of the codes and laws given by God. No one
can manufacture religion, and therefore manufactured religious systems
are rejected by the followers of the Vedic principles. In Bhagavad-gita
(15.15) it is said, vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah: Vedic knowledge
means to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna.
Therefore, whether one speaks of the Vedas, scriptures, religion or the
principles of everyone’s occupational duty, all of them must aim at
understanding Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Srimad-
Bhagavatam (1.2.6) therefore concludes:

sa vai [018705৫2778 paro dharmo
yato bhaktir adhoksaje
ahaituky apratihata
yayatma suprasidati
In other words, religious principles aim at learning how to render tran-
scendental loving service to the Lord. That service must be unmotivated
and unchecked by material conditions. Then human society will be
happy in all respects.

The मृध, the scriptures following the principles of Vedic knowledge,
are considered the evidence of Vedic principles. There are twenty dif-
ferent types of scripture for following religious principles, and among
them the scriptures of Manu and Yajfiavalkya are considered to be all-
pervading authorities. In the Yajiavalkya-smrti it is said:

Sruti-smrti-sadacarah
svasya ca priyam atmanah
samyak sankalpajah kamo
dharma-miilam ida smrtam
One should learn human behavior from sruti, the Vedas, and from smrti,
the scriptures following the Vedic principles. Srila Ripa Gosvami in his
Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu says:


--- Page 35 ---
30 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 11
Sruti-smrti-puranadi-
pancaratra-vidhirh vina
aikantiki harer bhaktir
utpatayaiva kalpate
The purport is that to become a devotee one must follow the principles
laid down in $ruti and smrti. One must follow the codes of the Puranas
and the pancaratriki-vidhi. One cannot be a pure devotee without follow-
ing the अथ and smrti, and the sruti and smrti without devotional service
cannot lead one to the perfection of life.

Therefore, from all the evidence the conclusion is that without bhakti,
devotional service, there is no question of religious principles. God is the
central figure in the performance of religious principles. Almost
everthing going on in this world as religion is devoid of any idea of devo-
tional service and is therefore condemned by the verdict of Srimad-
Bhagavatam. Without devotional service, so-called religious principles
are only cheating.

TRANSLATION

These are the general principles to be followed by all human
beings: truthfulness, mercy, austerity (observing fasts on certain
days of the month), bathing twice a day, tolerance, discrimination
between right and wrong, control of the mind, control of the
senses, nonviolence, celibacy, charity, reading of scripture,
simplicity, satisfaction, rendering service to saintly persons,
gradually taking leave of unnecessary engagements, observing the
futility of the unnecessary activities of human society, remaining
silent and grave and avoiding unnecessary talk, considering
whether one is the body or the soul, distributing food equally to
all living entities (both men and animals), seeing every soul

(especially in the human form) as a part of the Supreme Lord,
hearing about the activities and instructions given by the Supreme
Personality of Godhead (who is the shelter of the saintly persons),
chanting about these activities and instructions, always remember-
ing these activities and instructions, trying to render service,
performing worship, offering obeisances, becoming a servant, be-
coming a friend, and surrendering one’s whole self. O King
Yudhisthira, these thirty qualifications must be acquired in the
human form of life. Simply by acquiring these qualifications, one
can satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
PURPORT

In order that human beings be distinct from the animals, the great
saint Narada recommends that every human being be educated in terms
of the above-mentioned thirty qualifications. Nowadays there is pro-
paganda everywhere, all over the world, for a secular state, a state in-
terested only in mundane activities. But if the citizens of the state are not
educated in the above-mentioned good qualities, how can there be happi-
ness? For example, if the total populace is untruthful, how can the state
be happy? Therefore, without consideration of one’s belonging to a sec-
tarian religion, whether Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Buddhist or any
other sect, everyone should be taught to become truthful. Similarly,
everyone should be taught to be merciful, and everyone should observe
fasting on certain days of the month. Everyone should bathe twice a day,
cleanse his teeth and body externally, and cleanse his mind internally by
remembering the holy name of the Lord. The Lord is one, whether one is
Hindu, Muslim or Christian. Therefore, one should chant the holy name
of the Lord, regardless of differences in linguistic pronunciation. Also,
everyone should be taught to be very careful not to discharge semen un-
necessarily. This is very important for all human beings. If semen is not
discharged unnecessarily, one becomes extremely strong in memory,
determination, activity and the vitality of one’s bodily energy. Everyone
should also be taught to be simple in thought and feeling and satisfied in
body and mind. These are the general qualifications of a human being.
There is no question of a secular state or an ecclesiastical state. Unless
one is educated in the above-mentioned thirty qualities, there cannot be
any peace. Ultimately it is recommended:

Everyone should become a devotee of the Lord, because by becoming a
devotee of the Lord one automatically acquires the other qualities.

“In one who has unflinching devotional service to Krsna, all the good
qualities of Krsna and the demigods are consistently manifest. However,
he who has no devotion to the Supreme Personality of Godhead has no
good qualifications because he is engaged by mental concoction in ma-
terial existence, which is the external feature of the Lord.”
(Bhag. 5.18.12) Our Krsna consciousness movement, therefore, is all-
embracing. Human civilization should take it very seriously and practice
its principles for the peace of the world.

TRANSLATION

Those who have been reformed by the garbhadhana ceremony
and other prescribed reformatory methods, performed with Vedic
mantras and without interruption, and who have been approved by
Lord Brahma, are dvijas, or twiceborn. Such brahmanas, ksatriyas
and vaiSyas, purified by their family traditions and by their
behavior, should worship the Lord, study the Vedas and give
charity. In this system, they should follow the principles of the
four aSramas [brahmacarya, grhastha, vanaprastha and sannyasa).

PURPORT

After giving a general list of thirty qualifications for one’s behavior,
Narada Muni now describes the principles of the four varnas and four
asramas. A human being must be trained in the above-mentioned thirty
qualities; otherwise, he is not even a human being. Then, among such
qualified persons, the varnasrama process should be introduced. In the
varndsrama system, the first ceremony for purification is. garbhadhana,
which is performed with mantras at the time of sex for propagating a
good child. One who uses sex life not for sensual pleasures but only to
beget children according to the reformatory method is also accepted as a
brahmacari. One should not waste semen on sensual pleasure, violating
the principles of Vedic life. Restraint in sex is possible, however, only
when the populace is trained in the above-mentioned thirty qualities;
otherwise, it is not possible. Even if one is born in a family of 00005, or
twiceborn, if they have not followed the reformatory process he is called
a dvija-bandhu—not one of the twiceborn, but a friend of the twiceborn.
The whole purpose of this system is to create good population. As stated
in Bhagavad-gita, when women are polluted the populace is varna-
sarikara, and when the varna-sarikara population increases, the situation
of the entire world becomes hellish. Therefore, all the Vedic literatures


--- Page 41 ---
36 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 11
strongly warn against creating varna-sarikara population. When there is
varna-saritkara population, the people cannot be properly controlled for
peace and prosperity, regardless of great legislative assemblies, parlia-
ments and similar bodies.

TRANSLATION
For a brahmana there are six occupational duties. A ksatriya
should not accept charity, but he may perform the other five of
these duties. A king or ksatriya is not allowed to levy taxes on
brahmanas, but he may make his livelihood by levying minimal
taxes, customs duties, and penalty fines upon his other subjects.
PURPORT
Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura explains the position of brahmanas
and ksatriyas as follows. Brahmanas have six occupational duties, of
which three are compulsory —namely, studying the Vedas, worshiping


--- Page 42 ---
Text 15] The Perfect Society: Four Social Classes 37
the Deity and giving charity. By teaching, by inducing others to worship
the Deity, and by accepting gifts, the brahmanas receive the necessities
of life. This is also confirmed in the Manu-sarihita:
sannam tu karmanam asya
trini karmani jivika
yajanadhyapane caiva
viSuddhac ca pratigrahah
Of the six occupational duties of the brahmanas, three are compulsory —
namely, worship of the Deity, study of the Vedas and the giving of
charity. In exchange, a brahmana should receive charity, and this should
be his means of livelihood. A brahmana cannot take up any professional
occupational duty for his livelihood. The Sastras especially stress that if
one claims to be a brahmana, he cannot engage in the service of anyone
else; otherwise he at once falls from his position and becomes a $0070.
Srila Ripa Gosvami and Sanatana Gosvami belonged to a very respectful
family, but because they engaged in the service of Nawab Hussain
Shah—not even as ordinary clerks, but as ministers—they were
ostracized from brahminical society. Indeed, they became like Moham-
medans and even changed their names. Unless a brahmana is very pure,
he cannot accept charity from others. Charity should be given to those
who are pure. Even if one is born in a family of brahmanas, if one acts as
a $izdra one cannot accept charity, for this is strictly prohibited. Although
the ksatriyas are almost as qualified as the brahmanas, even they cannot
accept charity. This is strictly prohibited in this verse by the word
apratigraha. What to speak of the lower social orders, even the ksatriyas
must not accept charity. The king or government may levy taxes upon
the citizens in various ways —by revenue duties, customs duties, realiza-
tion of fines, and so on—provided the king is able to give full protection
to his subjects to assure the security of their life and property. Unless he
is able to give protection, he cannot levy taxes. However, a king must not
levy any tax upon the br@ahmanas and the Vaisnavas fully engaged in
Krsna consciousness.

TRANSLATION

As an alternative, a brahmana may also take to the vaiSya’s oc-
cupational duty of agriculture, cow protection, or trade. He may
depend on that which he has received without begging, he may beg
in the paddy field every day, he may collect paddy left in a field by
its proprietor, or he may collect food grains left here and there in
the shops of grain dealers. These are four means of livelihood that
may also be adopted by brahmanas. Among these four, each of
them in succession is better than the one preceding it.

PURPORT

A brahmana is sometimes offered land and cows in charity, and thus
for his livelihood he may act in the same way as a vaiSya, by cultivating
land, giving protection to cows and trading off his surpluses. A better
process, however, is to pick up grains from a field or from a dealer’s shop
without begging.

such an emergency, of course, everyone but the ksatriya may ac-
cept the means of livelihood of others.


--- Page 45 ---
40 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 11
PURPORT
The occupational duty of a brahmana should not be accepted by per-
sons in lower social orders, especially vai§yas and $iadras. For example,
an occupational duty of the brahmana is to teach Vedic knowledge, but
unless there is an emergency, this professional duty should not be ac-
cepted by the ksatriyas, vaisyas or sidras. Even a ksatriya cannot accept
the duties of a brahmana unless there is an emergency, and then even if
he does so he should not accept charity from anyone else. Sometimes
brahmanas protest against our Krsna consciousness movement for creat-
ing brahmanas from Europeans, or, in other words, from mlecchas and
yavanas. This movement, however, is here supported in Srimad-
Bhagavatam. At the present moment, society is in a chaotic condition,
and everyone has given up the cultivation of spiritual life, which is es-
pecially meant for the brahmanas. Because spiritual culture has been
stopped all over the world, there is now an emergency, and therefore it is
now time to train those who are considered lower and condemned, so that
they may become br@ahmanas and take up the work of spiritual progress.
The spiritual progress of human society has been stopped, and this
should be considered an emergency. Here is solid support from Narada
Muni of the movement known as Krsna consciousness.

In time of emergency, one may accept any of the various types of

one should not at any time accept the profession of a dog. The
profession of uiichasila, collecting grains from the field, is called


--- Page 47 ---
42 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 11
rta. Collecting without begging is called amrta, begging grains is
called mrta, tilling the ground is called pramrta, and trade is called
satyanrta. Engaging in the service of low-grade persons, however,
is called §va-vrtti, the profession of the dogs. Specifically,
brahmanas and ksatriyas should not engage in the low and abomi-
nable service of $iidras. Brahmanas should be well acquainted with
all the Vedic knowledge, and ksatriyas should be well acquainted
with the worship of demigods.
PURPORT
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (4.13), cdtur-varnyam maya srstari guna-
karma-vibhagasah: the four divisions of human society were created by
the Supreme Lord according to the three modes of material nature and -
the work ascribed to them. Formerly, the principle of dividing human
society into four sections— brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya and $iidra—was
strictly followed, but because of gradual neglect of the varnasrama prin-
ciples, varna-sarikara population developed, and the entire institution
has now been lost. In this age of Kali, practically everyone is a Sidra
(kalau $adra-sambhavah), and finding anyone who is a brahmana,
ksatriya or wiSya is very difficult. Although the Krsna consciousness
movement is a movement of brahmanas and Vaisnavas, it is trying to re-
establish the divine varndsrama institution, for without this division of
society there cannot be peace and prosperity anywhere.

jianam—knowledge; dayd—mercy; acyuta-atmatvam—accepting
oneself as an eternal servant of the Lord; satyam —truthfulness; ca—
also; brahma-laksanam—the symptoms of a brahmana.
TRANSLATION

The symptoms of a brahmana are control of the mind, control of
the senses, austerity and penance, cleanliness, satisfaction,
forgiveness, simplicity, knowledge, mercy, truthfulness, and com-
plete surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

PURPORT

In the institution of varndsrama-dharma, the symptoms of a
brahmana, ksatriya, vaiya, Sidra, brahmacari, grhastha, vanaprastha,
and sannyast are all described. The ultimate aim is acyutatmatvam—to
think always of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, or Visnu.
To make advancement in Krsna consciousness, one has to become a
brahmana, with the above-mentioned symptoms.

[dharma, artha and kama]; believing in the words of the spiritual
master and scripture; and always endeavoring with expertise in
earning money —these are the symptoms of the vaiSya.

Sidrasya—of the Sidra (the fourth grade of man in society, the
worker); sannatih—obedience to the higher classes (the brahmanas,
ksatriyas and vaiSyas); $aucam—cleanliness; sevd —service; svdmini—
to the master who maintains him; amadyaya—without duplicity;
amantra-yajiah—performance of sacrifices simply by offering obei-
sances (without mantras); hi—certainly; asteyam — practicing not to
steal; satyam—truthfulness; go—cows; vipra—brahmanas; raksanam
— protecting.

TRANSLATION

Offering obeisances to the higher sections of society [the
brahmanas, ksatriyas and ৪1685], being always very clean, being
free from duplicity, serving one’s master, performing sacrifices
without uttering mantras, not stealing, always speaking the truth
and giving all protection to the cows and brahmanas—these are the
symptoms of the Sadra.

PURPORT

It is everyone's experience that workers or servants are generally ac-
customed to stealing. A first-class servant is one who does not steal. Here
it is recommended that a first-class इद्वा must remain very clean, must
not steal or speak lies, and must always render service to his master. A
Sidra may attend sacrifices and Vedic ritualistic ceremonies along with
his master, but he should not utter the mantras, for these may be uttered
only by the members of the higher sections of society. Unless one is com-
pletely pure and has been raised to the standard of a brakmana, ksatriya
or vai§ya—in other words, unless one is dvija, twiceborn —the chanting
of mantras will not be fruitful.

strinam—of women; ca—also; pati-devanam—who have accepted
their husbands as worshipable; tat-Susriisé —readiness to render service
to her husband; anukiilata—being favorably disposed towards her hus-
band; tat-bandhusu—unto the friends and relatives of the husband;
anuvrttih—being similarly disposed (to treat them well for the satisfac-
tion of the husband); ca—and; nityam—regularly; tat-vrata-
dharanam—accepting the vows of the husband or acting exactly as the
husband acts.

TRANSLATION

To render service to the husband, to be always favorably dis-
posed toward the husband, to be equally well disposed toward the
husband’s relatives and friends, and to follow the vows of the hus-
band —these are the four principles to be followed by women de-
scribed as chaste.

PURPORT

It is very important for peaceful householder life that a woman follow
the vow of her husband. Any disagreement with the husband’s vow will
disrupt family life. In this regard, Canakya Pandita gives a very valuable
instruction: dampatyoh kalaho ndsti tatra srth svayam agatah. When
there are no fights between husband and wife, the goddess of fortune
automatically comes to the home. A woman’s education should be con-
ducted along the lines indicated in this verse. The basic principle for a
chaste woman is to be always favorably disposed toward her husband. In
Bhagavad-gita (1.40) it is said, strisu dustdsu varsneya jayate varna-
sarikarah: if the women are polluted, there will be varna-sarikara
population. In modern terms, the varna-sarikara are the hippies, who do
not follow any regulative injunctions. Another explanation is that when
the population is varna-sarikara, no one can know who is on what plat-
form. The varnasrama system scientifically divides society into four


--- Page 52 ---
Text 27] The Perfect Society: Four Social Classes 47
varnas and four @sramas, but in varna-sarikara society there are no such
distinctions, and no one can know who is who. In such a society, no one
can distinguish between a brahmana, a ksatriya, a vaiSya and a Sidra.
For peace and happiness in the material world, the varnasrama institu-
tion must be introduced. The symptoms of one’s activities must be
defined, and one must be educated accordingly. Then spiritual advance-
ment will automatically be possible.

A chaste woman must dress nicely and decorate herself with
golden ornaments for the pleasure of her husband. Always wear-
ing clean and attractive garments, she should sweep and clean the
household with water and other liquids so that the entire house is
always pure and clean. She should collect the household parapher-
nalia and keep the house always aromatic with incense and flowers
and must be ready to execute the desires of her husband. Being
modest and truthful, controlling her senses, and speaking in sweet
words, a chaste woman should engage in the service of her hus-
band with love, according to time and circumstances.

affairs and should be fully conversant with religious principles.

careful and always clean and pure. Thus a chaste woman should
engage with affection in the service of a husband who is not fallen.

Text 29] The Perfect Society: Four Social Classes 49
PURPORT

According to the injunction of Yajiiavalkya, an authority on religious
principles, aSuddheh sampratiksyo hi mahapataka-disitah. One is con-
sidered contaminated by the reactions of great sinful activities when one
has not been purified according to the methods of the dasa-vidha-
sariskara. In Bhagavad-gita, however, the Lord says, na mari duskrtino
madhah prapadyante naradhamah: “Those miscreants who do not sur-
render unto Me are the lowest of mankind.” The word naradhama
means “‘nondevotee.”” Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu also said, ye: bhaje sei
bada, abhakta—hina, chara. Anyone who is a devotee is sinless. One
who is not a devotee, however, is the most fallen and condemned. It is
recommended, therefore, that a chaste wife not associate with a fallen
husband. A fallen husband is one who is addicted to the four principles
of sinful activity —namely illicit sex, meat-eating, gambling and intoxi-
cation. Specifically, if one is not a soul surrendered to the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead, he is understood to be contaminated. Thus a chaste
woman is advised not to agree to serve such a husband. It is not that a
chaste woman should be like a slave while her husband is naradhama,
the lowest of men. Although the duties of a woman are different from
those of a man, a chaste woman is not meant to serve a fallen husband. If
her husband is fallen, it is recommended that she give up his association.
Giving up the association of her husband does not mean, however, that a
woman should marry again and thus indulge in prostitution. If a chaste
woman unfortunately marries a husband who is fallen, she should live
separately from him. Similarly, a husband can separate himself from a
woman who is not chaste according to the description of the $astra. The
conclusion is that a husband should be a pure Vaispava and that a woman
should be a chaste wife with all the symptoms described in this regard.
Then both of them will be happy and make spiritual progress in Krsna
consciousness.

TRANSLATION
The woman who engages in the service of her husband, follow-
ing strictly in the footsteps of the goddess of fortune, surely
returns home, back to Godhead, with her devotee husband, and
lives very happily in the Vaikuntha planets.
PURPORT
The faithfulness of the goddess of fortune is the ideal for a chaste
woman. The Brahma-samhita (5.29) says, laksmi-sahasra-sata-
sambhrama-sevyamanam. In the Vaikuntha planets, Lord Visnu is
worshiped by many, many thousands of goddesses of fortune, and in
Goloka Vrndavana, Lord Krsna is worshiped by many, many thousands
of gopis, all of whom are goddesses of fortune. A woman should serve
her husband as faithfully as the goddess of fortune. A man should be an
ideal servant of the Lord, and a woman should be an ideal wife like the
goddess of fortune. Then both husband and wife will be so faithful and
strong that by acting together they will return home, back to Godhead,
without a doubt. In this regard, Srila Madhvacarya gives this opinion:
harir asmin sthita iti
strinarm bhartari bhavana

Text 30] The Perfect Society: Four Social Classes 51
A woman should think of her husband as the Supreme Lord. Similarly, a
disciple should think of the spiritual master as the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, a siidra should think of a brahmana as the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead, and a servant should think of his master as the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this way, all of them will auto-
matically become devotees of the Lord. In other words, by thinking this
way, all of them will become Krsna conscious.

The four principal divisions of society —brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya
and $§idra—have been defined, and now there is a description of the
antyaja, the mixed classes. Among the mixed classes, there are two divi-
sions — pratilomaja and anulomaja. If a woman of a high caste marries a
man of a lower caste, their union is called pratilo. If a woman of a low

52 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 11
caste, however, marries a man of a higher caste, their union is called
anulo. The members of such dynasties have their traditional duties as
barbers, washermen and so on. Among the antyajas, those who are still
somewhat pure in that they do not steal and are not addicted to meat-
eating, drinking, illicit sex and gambling are called antevasayi. Among
people of the lower classes, intermarriage and the drinking of wine are
allowed, for these people do not recognize such conduct as sinful among
themselves.

My dear King, brahmanas well conversant in Vedic knowledge
have given their verdict that in every age [yuga] the conduct of

nature is auspicious both in this life and after death.

PURPORT

In Bhagavad-gita (3.35) it is said, sreyan sva-dharmo vigunah para-
dharmat svanusthitat: “It is far better to discharge one’s prescribed
duties, even though they may be faulty, than another’s duties.” The
antyajas, the men of the lower classes, are accustomed to stealing, drink-
ing and illicit sex, but that is not considered sinful. For example, if a

tiger kills a man, this is not sinful but if a man kills another man, this is
considered sinful, and the killer is hanged. What is a daily affair among
the animals is a sinful act in human society. Thus according to the
symptoms of higher and lower sections of society, there are different
varieties of occupational duties. According to the experts in Vedic knowl-
edge, these duties are prescribed in terms of the age concerned.

My dear King, if an agricultural field is cultivated again and
again, the power of its production decreases, and whatever seeds
are sown there are lost. Just as drops of ghee on a fire never ex-

in lusty desires mitigates such desires entirely.
PURPORT
If one continuously sprinkles drops of ghee on a fire, the fire will not
be extinguished, but if one suddenly puts a lump of ghee on a fire, the
fire may possibly be extinguished entirely. Similarly, those who are too
sinful and have thus been born in the lower classes are allowed to enjoy
sinful activities fully, for thus there is a chance that these activities will
become detestful to them, and they will get the opportunity to be
purified.

If one shows the symptoms of being a brahmana, ksatriya, vai§ya
or §idra, as described above, even if he has appeared in a different
class, he should be accepted according to those symptoms of
classification.
PURPORT
Herein it is clearly stated by Narada Muni that one should not be ac-
cepted as a brahmana, ksatriya, vaiSya or Sidra according to birth, for
although this is going on now, it is not accepted by the sastras. As stated
in Bhagavad-gita (4.13), catur-varnyarn maya srstarn guna-karma-
vibhagasah. Thus the four divisions of society —brahmana, ksatriya,
vaiSya and $idra—are to be ascertained according to qualities and ac-
tivities. If one was born in a brahmana family and has acquired the
brahminical qualifications, he is to be accepted as a brahmana; other-
wise, he should be considered a brahma-bandhu. Similarly, if a Sidra ac-
quires the qualities of a brahmana, although he was born in a Sidra
family, he is not a Sidra; because he has developed the qualities of a
brahmana, he should be accepted as a brahmana. The Krsna conscious-
ness movement is meant to develop these brahminical qualities. Regard-
less of the community in which one was born, if one develops the
qualities of a brahmana he should be accepted as a brahmana, and he


--- Page 61 ---
56 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 11
then may be offered the order of sannyasa. Unless one is qualified in
terms of the brahminical symptoms, one cannot take sannyasa. In desig-
nating a person a brahmana, ksatriya, vaiSya or Sidra, birth is not the
essential symptom. This understanding is very important. Herein Narada
Muni distinctly says that one may be accepted according to the caste of
his birth if he has the corresponding qualifications, but otherwise he
should not. One who has attained the qualifications of a brahmana,
regardless of where he was born, should be accepted as a brahmana.
Similarly, if one has developed the qualities of a Sidra or a candala,
regardless of where he was born, he should be accepted in terms of those
symptoms.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Seventh Canto, Eleventh
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “The Perfect Society: Four
Social Classes.”


--- Page 62 ---
CHAPTER TWELVE
The Perfect Society: Four Spiritual Classes

This chapter particularly describes the brahmacari and the person in the
vanaprastha stage, and it also gives a general description of the four
asramas— brahmacarya, grhastha, vanaprastha and sannyasa. In the
previous chapter, the great saint Narada Muni has described the varna
institution of society, and now, in this chapter, he will describe the stages
of spiritual advancement in the four dsramas, which are known as
brahmacarya, grhastha, vanaprastha and sannyasa.

The brahmacari should live under the care of the true spiritual
master, giving him sincere respect and obeisances, acting as his menial
servant, and always carrying out his order. The brahmacari should
engage himself in spiritual activities and study the Vedic literature under
the direction of the spiritual master. According to the brahmacarya
system, he should dress with a belt, deerskin, and matted hair and should
bear a danda, waterpot and sacred thread. He should collect alms daily in
the morning, and in the evening whatever alms he has collected he
should offer to the spiritual master. A brahmacart should accept prasada
upon the order of the spiritual master, and if the spiritual master some-
times forgets to order the disciple to eat, the disciple should not take
prasada on his own initiative; rather, he should fast. The brahmacart
should be trained to be satisfied with eating what is absolutely necessary,
he should be very expert in executing responsibilities, he should be
faithful, and he should control his senses and try to avoid the association
of women as far as possible. A brahmacari should very strictly abstain
from living with women and should not meet with grhasthas and those
too addicted to women. Nor should a brahmacari speak in a lonely place
with a woman.

After completing one’s education as a brahmacari in this way, one
should give daksina, an offering of gratitude, to one’s guru, and then one
may leave for home and accept the next asrama—the grhastha-
asrama—or else one may continue in the brahmacarya-asrama without
adulteration. The duties for the grhastha-asrama and brahmacarya-

57


--- Page 63 ---
58 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 12
asrama, as well as the duties for sannyasis, are prescribed in the sastras.
A grhastha is not meant to enjoy sex life without restriction. Indeed, the
whole purpose of Vedic life is to become free from sexual indulgence. All
the @sramas are recognized for spiritual progress, and therefore although
the grhastha-asrama gives a kind of license for sex life for a certain
time, it does not allow unrestricted sex life. Therefore, in grhastha life
also, there is no illicit sex. A grhastha should not accept a woman for sex-
ual enjoyment. Wasting semen 15 also illicit sex.

After the grhastha-asrama is another asrama, known as vanaprastha,
which is midway between grhastha and sannydasa. A person in the
vdnaprastha order is restricted in eating food grains and forbidden to eat
fruits that have not ripened on the tree. Nor should he cook food with
fire, although he is allowed to eat caru, grains that have been offered in a
sacrificial fire. He may also eat fruits and grains that have grown
naturally. Living in a thatched cottage, the vanaprastha should endure
all kinds of heat and cold. He should not cut his nails or hair, and he
should give up cleaning his body and teeth. He should wear tree bark, ac-
cept a danda, and practice life in the forest, taking a vow to live there
for twelve years, eight years, four years, two years or at least one year. At
last, when because of old age he can no longer perform the activities of a
vanaprastha, he should gradually stop everything and in this way give
up his body.

vow, the brahmacari should live at the guru-kula, only for the
benefit of the guru.

A brahmacari should be quite well behaved and gentle and

active and expert, fully believing in the instructions of the spiri-
tual master and the $astra. Fully controlling his senses, he should
associate only as much as necessary with women or those con-
trolled by women.

PURPORT

A brahmacari should be very careful not to mix with women or with
men addicted to women. Although when he goes out to beg alms it is
necessary to talk with women and with men very much attached to
women, this association should be very short, and he should talk with
them only about begging alms, and not more. A brahmacari should be
very careful in associating with men who are attached to women.

TRANSLATION

A brahmaciri, or one who has not accepted the grhastha-asrama
[family life], must rigidly avoid talking with women or about
women, for the senses are so powerful that they may agitate even
the mind of a sannyasi, a member of the renounced order of life.

PURPORT

Brahmacarya essentially means the vow not to marry but to observe
strict celibacy (brhad-vrata). A brahmacari or sannyast should avoid
talking with women or reading literature concerning talks between man
and woman. The injunction restricting association with women is the
basic principle of spiritual life. Associating or talking with women is
never advised in any of the Vedic literatures. The entire Vedic system
teaches one to avoid sex life so that one may gradually progress from
brahmacarya to grhastha, from grhastha to vanaprastha, and from
vanaprastha to sannyasa and thus give up material enjoyment, which is
the original cause of bondage to this material world. The word brhad-
vrata refers to one who has decided not to marry, or in other words, not
to indulge in sex life throughout his entire life.

TRANSLATION
If the wife of the spiritual master is young, a young brahmacari
should not allow her to care for his hair, massage his body with oil,
or bathe him with affection like a mother.
PURPORT
The relationship between the student or disciple and the wife of the
spiritual master or teacher is like that between son and mother. A mother
sometimes cares for her son by combing his hair, massaging his body
with oil, or bathing him. Similarly, the wife of the teacher is also a
mother (guru-patni), and therefore she may also care for the disciple in a
motherly way. If the wife of the teacher is a young woman, however, a
young brahmacari should not allow such a mother to touch him. This is
strictly prohibited. There are seven kinds of mothers:
atma-mata guroh patni
brahmani raja-patnika
dhenur dhatri tatha prthvt
saptaita matarah smrtah
These mothers are the original mother, the wife of the teacher or spiri-
tual master, the wife of a brahmana, the king’s wife, the cow, the nurse
and the earth. Unnecessary association with women, even with one’s
mother, sister or daughter, is strictly prohibited. This is human civiliza-
tion. A civilization that allows men to mix unrestrictedly with women is
an animal civilization. In Kali-yuga, people are extremely liberal, but
mixing with women and talking with them as equals actually constitutes
an uncivilized way of life.

nanu—certainly; agnih—the fire; pramada—the woman (one who
bewilders the mind of man); nama—the very name; ghrta-kumbha—a
pot of butter; samah—like; puman—a man; sutam api—even one’s
daughter; rahah—in a secluded place; jahydt—one must not associate

TRANSLATION

‘Woman is compared to fire, and man is compared to a butter pot.
Therefore a man should avoid associating even with his own
daughter in a secluded place. Similarly, he should also avoid asso-
ciation with other women. One should associate with women only
for important business and not otherwise.

PURPORT

If a butter pot and fire are kept together, the butter within the pot will
certainly melt. Woman is compared to fire, and man is compared to a
butter pot. However advanced one may be in restraining the senses, it is
almost impossible for a man to keep himself controlled in the presence of
a woman, even if she is his own daughter, mother or sister. Indeed, his
mind is agitated even if one is in the renounced order of life. Therefore,
Vedic civilization carefully restricts mingling between men and women.
If one cannot understand the basic principle of restraining association
between man and woman, he is to be considered an animal. That is the
purport of this verse.

senses); idam—this (the body and senses); tSvarah —completely inde-
pendent of illusion; dvaitam —duality; tavat—for that long; na—does
not; viramet—see; tatah—Dby such duality; hi—indeed; asya—of the

TRANSLATION

As long as a living entity is not completely self-realized —as long
as he is not independent of the misconception of identifying with
his body, which is nothing but a reflection of the original body and
senses — he cannot be relieved of the conception of duality, which
is epitomized by the duality between man and woman. Thus there
is every chance that he will fall down because his intelligence is
bewildered.

PURPORT

Here is another important warning that a man must save himself from
attraction to woman. Until one is self-realized, fully independent of the
illusory conception of the material body, the duality of man and woman
must undoubtedly continue, but when one is actually self-realized this
distinction ceases.

vidya-vinaya-sampanne
brahmane gavi hastini
Suni caiva svapake ca

“The humble sage, by virtue of true knowledge, sees with equal vision a
learned and gentle brahmana, a cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater
[outcaste].” (Bg. 5.18) On the spiritual platform, the learned person not
only gives up the duality of man and woman, but also gives up the
duality of man and animal. This is the test of self-realization. One must
realize perfectly that the living being is spirit soul but is tasting various
types of material bodies. One may theoretically understand this, but
when one has practical realization, then he actually becomes a pandita,
one who knows. Until that time, the duality continues, and the concep-
tion of man and woman also continues. In this stage, one should be ex-
tremely careful about mixing with women. No one should think himself
perfect and forget the $astric instruction that one should be very careful


--- Page 72 ---
Text 11] The Perfect Society: Four Spiritual Classes 67
about associating even with his daughter, mother or sister, not to speak
of other women. Srila Madhvacarya cites the following $lokas in this
regard:

dvaita-jianarn tad-anyatha
yatha ]7 27077 tatha vastu

Unity in variety is real knowledge, and therefore giving up variety ar-
tificially does not reflect perfect knowledge of monism. According to the
acintya-bhedabheda philosophy of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, there are
varieties, but all of them constitute one unit. Such knowledge is knowl-
edge of perfect oneness.

--- Page 73 ---
68 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 12
grhastha, however, is given permission by the spiritual master to
indulge in sex during the period favorable for procreation.
PURPORT

It is sometimes misunderstood that a grhastha, a householder, is per-
mitted to indulge in sex at any time. This is a wrong conception of
grhastha life. In spiritual life, whether one is a grhastha, vanaprastha,
sannyasi or brahmacari, everyone is under the control of the spiritual
master. For brahmacaris and sannyasis there are strong restrictions on
sexual indulgence. Similarly, there are strong restrictions for grhasthas.
Grhasthas should indulge in sex life only in accordance with the order of
the guru. Therefore it is mentioned here that one must follow the orders
of the spiritual master (guru-vrttir vikalpena). When the spiritual master
orders, the grhastha may accept sex life. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-
gita (7.11). Dharmaviruddho bhiitesu kamo ’smi: indulgence in sex life
without disobedience to the religious rules and regulations constitutes a
religious principle. The grhastha is allowed to indulge in sex life during
the period favorable for procreation and in accordance with the spiritual
master’s order. If the spiritual master’s orders allow a grhastha to engage
in sex life at a particular time, then the grhastha may do so; otherwise, if
the spiritual master orders against it, the grhastha should abstain. The
grhastha must obtain permission from the spiritual master to observe the
ritualistic ceremony of garbhadhana-sarskara. Then he may approach
his wife to beget children, otherwise not. A brahmana generally remains
a brahmacari throughout his entire life, but although some brahmanas
become grhasthas and indulge in sex life, they do so under the complete
control of the spiritual master. The ksatriya is allowed to marry more
than one wife, but this also must be in accordance with the instructions
of the spiritual master. It is not that because one is a grhastha he may
marry as many times as he likes and indulge in sex life as he likes. This
is not spiritual life. In spiritual life, one must conduct one’s whole life
under the guidance of the guru. Only one who executes his spiritual life
under the direction of the spiritual master can achieve the mercy of
Krsna. Yasya prasadad bhagavat-prasadah. If one desires to advance in
spiritual life but he acts whimsically, not following the orders of the
spiritual master, he has no shelter. Yasyaprasadan na gatih kuto ‘pi.

Without the spiritual master’s order, even the grhastha should not in-
dulge in sex life.

TRANSLATION
According to the rules and regulations mentioned above, one
who is twiceborn, namely a brahmana, ksatriya or vaisya, should
reside in the guru-kula under the care of the spiritual master.
There he should study and learn all the Vedic literatures along
with their supplements and the Upanisads, according to his ability
and power to study. If possible, the student or disciple should
reward the spiritual master with the remuneration the spiritual
master requests, and then, following the master’s order, the disci-
ple should leave and accept one of the other asramas, namely the
grhastha-asrama, vanaprastha-asrama or sannyasa-aSrama, as he
desires.
PURPORT
To study the Vedas and understand them, of course, requires some
special intelligence, but the members of the three higher sections of


--- Page 76 ---
Text 15] The Perfect Society: Four Spiritual Classes 71
society —namely the brahmanas, ksatriyas and vaiSyas—must learn the
Vedic literatures according to their capability and power to understand.
In other words, studying the Vedic literatures is compulsory for everyone
but the Sidras and antyajas. The Vedic literature gives the knowledge
that can lead one to understand the Absolute Truth—Brahman,
Paramatma or Bhagavan. Guru-kula, or the reformatory educational in-
stitution, should be used only to understand Vedic knowledge. At the
present time there are many educational institutions for training and
technology, but such knowledge has nothing to do with understanding of
the Absolute Truth. Technology, therefore, is meant for the $80705,
whereas the Vedas are meant for the dvijas. Consequently this verse
states, dvijo ‘dhityavabudhya ca trayim sangopanisadam. At the present
time, in the age of Kali, practically everyone is a Sidra, and no one is a
dvija. Therefore the condition of society has very much deteriorated.

Another point to be observed from this verse is that from the
brahmacadri-asrama one may accept the sannyasa-asrama, vanaprastha-
asrama or grhastha-asrama. It is not compulsory for a brahmacari to be-
come a grhastha. Because the ultimate aim is to understand the Absolute
Truth, there is no necessity of going through all the different dsramas.
Thus one may proceed to the sannydsa-asrama directly from the
brahmacari-asrama. Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura accepted
the sannyasa-asrama directly from the brahmacari-asrama. In other
words, His Divine Grace Bhaktisiddhinta Sarasvati Thikura did not
think it compulsory to accept the grhastha-asrama or vanaprastha-
asrama.

tities; sva-dhamabhih—along with His Lordship’s paraphernalia;

TRANSLATION

One should realize that in the fire, in the spiritual master, in
one’s self and in all living entities—in all circumstances and condi-
tions—the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu, has
simultaneously entered and not entered. He is situated externally
and internally as the full controller of everything.

PURPORT

Realization of the Supreme Personality of Godhead’s omnipresence is
the perfect realization of the Absolute Truth to be attained through the
study of the Vedic literatures. As stated in the Brahma-sarihita (5.35),
andantara-stha-paramanu-cayantara-stham: the Lord is situated within
the universe, within the heart of every living entity and also within the
atom. We should understand that whenever the Supreme Personality of
Godhead is present, He is present with all His paraphernalia, including
His name, form, associates and servants. The living entity is part and
parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thus one should
understand that since the Supreme Lord has entered the atom, the living
entities are also there. One must accept the inconceivable quality of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, for no one can understand from the
material point of view how the Lord is all-pervasive and yet is situated in
His own abode, Goloka Vrndavana. This realization is possible if one
strictly follows the regulative principles of asrama (brahmacari,
grhastha, vanaprastha and sannydsa). Srila Madhvacarya says in this
regard:

apravistah sarva-gatah
pravistas tv anuripavan
০৮071 dvi-ripo bhagavan
harir eko janardanah


--- Page 78 ---
Text 16] The Perfect Society: Four Spiritual Classes 73
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, in His original form, has not en-
tered everything (apravistah), but in His impersonal form He has en-
tered (pravistah). Thus He has entered and not entered simultaneously.
This is also explained in Bhagavad-gita (9.4), wherein the Lord says:
maya tatam 10071 sarvari
jagad avyakta-miirtind
mat-sthani sarva-bhitani
na caharih tesv avasthitah
“By Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded. All
beings are in Me, but I am not in them.” The Lord can defy Himself.
Thus there is variety in unity (ekatvari bahutvam). .

Lord, for in this way it is possible to understand the Absolute
Truth.
PURPORT
This is the beginning of self-realization. One must first understand
how Brahman is present everywhere and how He is acting. This educa-
tion is called brahma-jijidsa and is the real concern of human life. With-
out such knowledge, one cannot claim to be a human being; rather, he
remains in the animal kingdom. As it is said, sa eva go-kharah: without
such knowledge, one is no better than a cow or an ass.

fruit ripened by the sunshine.

one’s self or one’s own. One should gradually merge the material
body into the five elements [earth, water, fire, air and sky].
PURPORT

The body is an effect of a cause, namely the five material elements
(earth, water, fire, air and sky). In other words, one should know per-
fectly well that the material body is nothing but a combination of the five
elements. This knowledge constitutes merging of the material body and
the five material elements. Merging into Brahman in perfect knowledge
means understanding perfectly that one is not the body but a spiritual
soul.

TRANSLATION

A sober, self-realized person who has full knowledge should
merge the various parts of the body in their original sources. The
holes in the body are caused by the sky, the process of breathing is
caused by the air, the heat of the body is caused by fire, and semen,
blood and mucus are caused by water. The hard substances, like
skin, muscle and bone, are caused by earth. In this way all the


--- Page 85 ---

constituents of the body are caused by various elements, and they
should be merged again into those elements.
PURPORT
To be self-realized, one must understand the original sources of the
various elements of the body. The body is a combination of skin, bone,
muscle, blood, semen, urine, stool, heat, breath and so on, which all come
from earth, water, fire, air and sky. One must be well conversant with
the sources of all the bodily constituents. Then one becomes a self-
realized person, or atmavan, one who knows the self.

pleasure, along with the genitals, should be bestowed upon
Prajapati. The rectum, with the power of evacuation, should be
bestowed, in its proper place, unto Mrtyu. The aural instrument,
along with sound vibration, should be given to the deities presid-
ing over the directions. The instrument of touch, along with the
sense objects of touch, should be given to Vayu. Form, with the
power of sight, should be bestowed upon the sun. The tongue,
along with the demigod Varuna, should be bestowed upon water,
and the power of smell, along with the two AsSvini-kumara
demigods, should be bestowed upon the earth.

and which induces one to think, “I am this body, and everything

material activities, in Rudra, the predominating deity of false ego.
Material consciousness, along with the goal of thought, should be
merged in the individual living being, and the demigods acting
under the modes of material nature should be merged, along with
the perverted living being, into the Supreme Being. The earth
should be merged in water, water in the brightness of the sun, this
brightness into the air, the air into the sky, the sky into the false
ego, the false ego into the total material energy, the total material
energy into the unmanifested ingredients [the pradhina feature of
the material energy], and at last the ingredient feature of material
manifestation into the Supersoul.

When all the material designations have thus merged into their
respective material elements, the living beings, who are all
ultimately completely spiritual, being one in quality with the


--- Page 89 ---

Supreme Being, should cease from material existence, as flames
cease when the wood in which they are burning is consumed.
When the material body is returned to its various material ele-
ments, only the spiritual being remains. This spiritual being is
Brahman and is equal in quality with Parabrahman.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Seventh Canto, Twelfth
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “The Perfect Society: Four
Spiritual Classes.”

CHAPTER THIRTEEN
The Behavior of a Perfect Person

This Thirteenth Chapter describes the regulative principles for
sannyasts and also describes the history of an avadhiita. It concludes
with a description of perfection for the student in spiritual advancement.

Sri Narada Muni has been describing the symptoms of various
asramas and varnas. Now, in this chapter, he specifically describes the
regulative principles to be followed by sannyasis. After retiring from
family life, one should accept the status of vanaprastha, in which he
must formally accept the body as his means of existence but gradually
forget the bodily necessities of life. After vanaprastha life, having left
home, one should travel to different places as a sannyast. Without bodily
comforts and free from dependence on anyone with respect to bodily
necessities, one should travel everywhere, wearing almost nothing or ac-
tually walking naked. Without association with ordinary human society,
one should beg alms and always be satisfied in himself. One should be a
friend to every living entity and be very peaceful in Krsna consciousness.
A sannyast should travel alone in this way, not caring for life or death,
waiting for the time when he will leave his material body. He should not
indulge in unnecessary books or adopt professions like astrology, nor
should he try to become a great orator. He should also give up the path of
unnecessary argument and should not depend on anyone under any
circumstances. He should not try to allure people into becoming his disci-
ples just so that the number of his disciples may increase. He should give
up the habit of reading many books as a means of livelihood, and he
should not attempt to increase the number of temples and mathas, or
monasteries. When a sannyast thus becomes completely independent,
peaceful and equipoised, he can select the destination he desires after
death and follow the principles by which to reach that destination. Al-
though fully learned, he should always remain silent, like a dumb per-
son, and travel like a restless child.

In this regard, Narada Muni described a meeting between Prahlada
and a saintly person who had adopted the mode of life of a python. In this

85


--- Page 91 ---
86 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 13
way he described the symptoms of a paramaharisa. A person who has at-
tained the paramahamsa stage knows very well the distinction between
matter and spirit. He is not at all interested in gratifying the material
senses, for he is always deriving pleasure from devotional service to the
Lord. He is not very anxious to protect his material body. Being satisfied
with whatever he attains by the grace of the Lord, he is completely inde-
pendent of material happiness and distress, and thus he is transcendental
to all regulative principles. Sometimes he accepts severe austerities, and
sometimes he accepts material opulence. His only concern is to satisfy
Krsna, and for that purpose he can do anything and everything, without
reference to the regulative principles. He is never to be equated with ma-
terialistic men, nor is he subject to the judgments of such men.

Sri Narada Muni said: A person able to cultivate spiritual knowl-
edge should renounce all material connections, and merely keep-
ing the body inhabitable, he should travel from one place to
another, passing only one night in each village. In this way, with-
out dependence in regard to the needs of the body, the sannyasi
should travel all over the world.

TRANSLATION
A person in the renounced order of life may try to avoid even a
dress to cover himself. If he wears anything at all, it should be only
a loincloth, and when there is no necessity, a sannyasi should not
even accept a danda. A sannyasi should avoid carrying anything
but a danda and kamandalu.

this way he should move from one place to another.

TRANSLATION
During unconsciousness and consciousness, and between the
two, he should try to understand the self and be fully situated in
the self. In this way, he should realize that the conditional and
liberated stages of life are only illusory and not actually factual.
With such a higher understanding, he should see only the Ab-
solute Truth pervading everything.
PURPORT
The unconscious state is nothing but ignorance, darkness or material
existence, and in the conscious state one is awake. The marginal state,
between consciousness and unconsciousness, has no permanent exis-
tence. Therefore one who is advanced in understanding the self should
understand that unconsciousness and consciousness are but illusions, for
they fundamentally do not exist. Only the Supreme Absolute Truth ex-
ists. As confirmed by the Lord in Bhagavad-gita (9.4):

“By Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded. All
beings are in Me, but I am not in them.”” Everything exists on the basis of
Krsna’s impersonal feature; nothing can exist without Krsna. Therefore
the advanced devotee of Krsna can see the Lord everywhere, without il-
lusion.

TRANSLATION

Since the material body is sure to be vanquished and the dura-
tion of one’s life is not fixed, neither death nor life is to be
praised. Rather, one should observe the eternal time factor, in
which the living entity manifests himself and disappears.

PURPORT

The living entities in the material world, not only at the present but
also in the past, have been involved in trying to solve the problem of
birth and death. Some stress death and point to the illusory existence of
everything material, whereas others stress life, trying to preserve it per-

petually and enjoy it to the best of their ability. Both of them are fools
and rascals. It is advised that one observe the eternal time factor, which
is the cause of the material body’s appearance and disappearance, and
that one observe the living entity’s entanglement in this time factor. Srila
Bhaktivinoda Thakura therefore sings in his Gitavali:
anadi karama-phale, padi *bhavarpava-jale,
taribare na dekhi upaya
One should observe the activities of eternal time, which is the cause of
birth and death. Before the creation of the present millennium, the liv-
ing entities were under the influence of the time factor, and within the
time factor the material world comes into existence and is again anni-
hilated. Bhitva bhuatva praliyate. Being under the control of the time
factor, the living entities appear and die, life after life. This time factor
is the impersonal representation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
who gives the living entities conditioned by material nature a chance to
emerge from this nature by surrendering to Him.

TRANSLATION
Literature that is a useless waste of time—in other words,
literature without spiritual benefit—should be rejected. One
should not become a professional teacher as a means of earning
one’s livelihood, nor should one indulge in arguments and
counterarguments. Nor should one take shelter of any cause or
faction.
PURPORT
A person desiring to advance in spiritual understanding should be ex-
tremely careful to avoid reading ordinary literature. The world is full of
ordinary literature that creates unnecessary agitation in the mind. Such
literature, including newspapers, dramas, novels and magazines, is fac-
tually not meant for advancement in spiritual knowledge. Indeed, it has
been described as a place of enjoyment for crows (tad vayasar tirtham).
Anyone advancing in spiritual knowledge must reject such literature.
Furthermore, one should not concern oneself with the conclusions of
various logicians or philosophers. Of course, those who preach sometimes
need to argue with the contentions of opponents, but as much as possible
one should avoid an argumentative attitude. In this connection, Srila
Madhvacarya says:
aprayojana-paksarn na sarisrayet
naprayojana-paksi syan
na vrtha Sisya-bandha-krt
na codasinah Sastrani
na viruddhani cabhyaset

“There is no need to take shelter of unnecessary literature or concern
oneself with many so-called philosophers and thinkers who are useless
for spiritual advancement. Nor should one accept a disciple for the sake
of fashion or popularity. One should be callous to these so-called sastras,


--- Page 98 ---
Text 8] The Behavior of a Perfect Person 93
neither opposing nor favoring them, and one should not earn one’s liveli-
hood by taking money for explaining astra. A sannydsi must always be
neutral and seek the means to advance in spiritual life, taking full
shelter under the lotus feet of the Lord.”

TRANSLATION
A sannyasi must not present allurements of material benefits to
gather many disciples, nor should he unnecessarily read many
books or give discourses as a means of livelihood. He must never
attempt to increase material opulences unnecessarily.
PURPORT
So-called svamis and yogis generally make disciples by alluring them
with material benefits. There are many so-called gurus who attract disci-
ples by promising to cure their diseases or increase their material opu-
lence by manufacturing gold. These are lucrative allurements for unin-
telligent men. A sannyasi is prohibited from making disciples through
such material allurements. Sannydsis sometimes indulge in material
opulence by unnecessarily constructing many temples and monasteries,
but actually such endeavors should be avoided. Temples and monasteries


--- Page 99 ---
94 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 13
should be constructed for the preaching of spiritual consciousness or
Krsna consciousness, not to provide free hotels for persons who are
useful for neither material nor spiritual purposes. Temples and monas-
teries should be strictly off limits to worthless clubs of crazy men. In the
Krsna consciousness movement we welcome everyone who agrees at least
to follow the movement’s regulative principles —no illicit sex, no intoxi-
cation, no meat-eating and no gambling. In the temples and monasteries,
gatherings of unnecessary, rejected, lazy fellows should be strictly dis-
allowed. The temples and monasteries should be used exclusively by de-
votees who are serious about spiritual advancement in Krsna conscious-
ness. Srila Vi$vanatha Cakravarti Thakura explains the word arambhan
as meaning mathadi-vyaparan, which means “‘attempts to construct
temples and monasteries.” The first business of the sannydast is to preach
Krsna consciousness, but if, by the grace of Krsna, facilities are availa-
ble, then he may construct temples and monasteries to give shelter to the
serious students of Krsna consciousness. Otherwise such temples and
monasteries are not needed.

sannyasi, such as the tridanda and kamandalu. According to
necessity, he may sometimes accept those symbols and sometimes
reject them.
PURPORT

There are four stages of the renounced order of life — kuticaka,
bahidaka, parivrajakacarya and paramaharisa. Herein, Srimad-
Bhagavatam considers the paramaharisas among the sannyasis. The
Mayavadi impersonalist sannydsis cannot attain the paramaharisa stage.
This is because of their impersonal conception of the Absolute Truth.
Brahmeti paramatmeti bhagavan iti sabdyate. The Absolute Truth is
perceived in three stages, of which bhagavdn, or realization of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, is meant for the paramaharisas. In-
deed, Srimad-Bhagavatam itself is meant for the paramaharisas
(paramo nirmatsaranam satam). Unless one is in the paramahamsa
stage, he is not eligible to understand the Srimad-Bhagavatam. For
paramaharnsas, or sannyasis in the Vaisnava order, preaching is the first
duty. To preach, such sannyasis may accept the symbols of sannyasa,
such as the danda and kamandalu, or sometimes they may not.
Generally the Vaisnava sannyasis, being paramaharisas, are auto-
matically called babajis, and they do not carry a kamandalu or danda.
Such a sannyasi is free to accept or reject the marks of sannyasa. His
only thought is “Where is there an opportunity to spread Krsna con-
sciousness ?”’ Sometimes the Krsna consciousness movement sends its
representative sannydsis to foreign countries where the danda and
kamandalu are not very much appreciated. We send our preachers in or-
dinary dress to introduce our books and philosophy. Our only concern is
to attract people to Krsna consciousness. We may do this in the dress of
sannydasis or in the regular dress of gentlemen. Our only concern is to
spread interest in Krsna consciousness.

A great personality very much advanced in Krsna consciousness may
not expose himself by the signs of a sannydsi. To cover himself, he may
live like a restless child or a dumb person, although he is the greatest
orator or poet.

where but sits in one place for years and eats whatever is automatically
available. Prahlada Maharaja, along with his associates, met this great
saint and spoke to him as follows.

some of his confidential associates just to study the nature of
saintly persons. Thus he arrived at the bank of the Kaveri, where
there was a mountain known as Sahya. There he found a great
saintly person who was lying on the ground, covered with dirt and
dust, but who was deeply spiritually advanced.

known.
PURPORT
The inhabitants of that particular place on the bank of the Kaveri in
the valley of the mountain known as Sahya were unable to understand
whether that saint was the same man they had known. It is therefore
said, vaisnavera kriya mudra vie na bhujhaya. A highly advanced
Vaisnava lives in such a way that no one can understand what he is or
what he was. Nor should attempts be made to understand the past of a
Vaisnava. Without asking the saintly person about his previous life,
Prahlada Maharaja immediately offered him respectful obeisances.

TRANSLATION
Seeing the saintly person to be quite fat, Prahlada Maharaja said:
My dear sir, you undergo no endeavor to earn your livelihood, but
you have a stout body, exactly like that of a materialistic enjoyer. I
know that if one is very rich and has nothing to do, he becomes ex-
tremely fat by eating and sleeping and performing no work.
PURPORT
Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura did not like his disciples to
become very fat in the course of time. He would become very anxious
upon seeing his fat disciples becoming bhogis, or enjoyers of the senses.
This attitude is herewith confirmed by Prahlada Maharaja, who was
surprised to see a saintly person adopting djagara-vrtti and becoming
very fat. In the material world also, we generally see that when a man


--- Page 106 ---
Text 18] The Behavior of a Perfect Person 101
who is poor and skinny gradually endeavors to earn money through busi-
ness or some other means and he then gets the money, he enjoys the
senses to his satisfaction. By enjoying the senses one becomes fat.
Therefore in spiritual advancement becoming fat is not at all satisfactory.

O brahmana, fully in knowledge of transcendence, you have
nothing to do, and therefore you are lying down. It is also under-
stood that you have no money for sense enjoyment. How then has
your body become so fat? Under the circumstances, if you do not
consider my question impudent, kindly explain how this has hap-
pened.
PURPORT

Generally those engaged in spiritual advancement take food only once,
either in the afternoon or in the evening. If one takes food only once,
naturally he does not become fat. The learned sage, however, was quite


--- Page 107 ---
102 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 13
fat, and therefore Prahlada Maharaja was very much surprised. Because
of being experienced in self-realization, a transcendentalist certainly be-
comes bright-faced. And one who is advanced in self-realization must be
considered to possess the body of a brahmana. Because the bright-faced
saintly person was lying down and not working and yet was quite fat,
Prahlada Maharaja was puzzled and wanted to question him about this.

Prahlada Maharaja studied the bodily features of the saintly person,
and through the saint’s physiognomy Prahlada Maharaja could under-
stand that he was intelligent and expert, although he was lying down and
not doing anything. Prahlada was naturally inquisitive about why he was
lying there inactive.

thus know clearly the results of acceptance and rejection of things
as they are.

PURPORT

A pure devotee like Prahlada Maharaja can understand the minds of
others because of his pure vision in devotional service. A devotee like
Prahlada Maharaja can study another man’s character without difficulty.

cause of your being a pure devotee. He always drives away all the
darkness of ignorance, as the sun drives away the darkness of the
universe.
PURPORT

The words bhaktya kevalaya indicate that simply by executing devo-
tional service one can become full of all knowledge. Krsna is the master
of all knowledge (aisvaryasya samagrasya viryasya yasasah sriyah).
The Lord is situated in everyone’s heart (कण्वाय, sarva-bhiatanarm hrd-
dese 'rjuna tisthati), and when the Lord is pleased with a devotee, the
Lord instructs him. Only to the devotees, however, does the Lord give in-
structions by which to advance further and further in devotional service.
To others, the nondevotees, the Lord gives instructions according to the
manner of their surrender. The pure devotee is described by the words
bhaktya kevalaya. Srila Visvanitha Cakravarti Thakura explains that
bhaktya kevalaya means jiana-karmady-amisraya, ‘unmixed with
fruitive activities or speculative knowledge.” Simply surrendering at the
lotus feet is the cause of all a devotee’s enlightenment and awareness.

have learned by hearing from authorities. I cannot remain silent in
this regard, for a personality like you is just fit to be spoken to by
one who desires self-purification.
PURPORT

A saintly person doesn’t wish to speak to anyone and everyone, and he
is therefore grave and silent. Generally a common man does not need to
be advised. Unless one is prepared to take instructions, it is said that a
saintly person should not address him, although sometimes, because of
great kindness, a saintly person speaks to ordinary men. As for Prahlada
Maharaja, however, since he was not a common, ordinary man, whatever
questions he posed would have to be answered, even by a great and ex-
alted personality. Therefore the saintly brahmana did not remain silent,
but began to answer. These answers, however, were not concocted by
him. This is indicated by the words yatha-srutam, meaning “‘as I have
heard from the authorities.” In the parampara system, when the ques-
tions are bona fide the answers are bona fide. No one should attempt to
create or manufacture answers. One must refer to the sastras and give
answers according to Vedic understanding. The words yatha-srutam
refer to Vedic knowledge. The Vedas are known as sruti because this
knowledge is received from authorities. The statements of the Vedas are
known as Sruti-pramana. One should quote evidence from the Sruti—
the Vedas or Vedic literature —and then one’s statements will be correct.
Otherwise one’s words will proceed from mental concoction.

TRANSLATION

Because of insatiable material desires, I was being carried away
by the waves of material nature’s laws, and thus I was engaging in
different activities, struggling for existence in various forms of
life.

PURPORT

As long as a living entity wants to fulfill various types of material
desire, he must continuously change from one body to accept another.
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura explains that as a small piece of
grass falls in a river and is tossed about with different types of wood and
tree branches, the living entity floats in the ocean of material existence
and is dashed and tossed amidst material conditions. This is called the
struggle for existence. One kind of fruitive activity causes the living
being to take one form of body, and because of actions performed in that
body, another body is created. One must therefore stop these material ac-
tivities, and the chance to do so is given in the human form of life.
Specifically, our energy to act should be engaged in the service of the
Lord, for then materialistic activities will automatically stop. One must
fulfill one’s desires by surrendering unto the Supreme Lord, for He
knows how to fulfill them. Even though one may have material desires,
one should therefore engage in the devotional service of the Lord. That
will purify one’s struggle for existence.

Text 25] The Behavior of a Perfect Person 109
and death in different species may be called the evolutionary process, but
in the Western world it has been wrongly explained. Darwin’s theory of
evolution from animal to man is incomplete because the theory does not
present the reverse condition, namely evolution from man to animal. In
this verse, however, evolution has been very well explained on the
strength of Vedic authority. Human life, which is obtained in the course
of the evolutionary process, is a chance for elevation (svargapavarga) or
for degradation (tirascam punar asya ca). If one uses this human form
of life properly, he can elevate himself to the higher planetary systems,
where material happiness is many thousands of times better than on this
planet, or one may cultivate knowledge by which to become free from
the evolutionary process and be reinstated in one’s original spiritual life.
This is called apavarga, or liberation.

Material life is called pavarga because here we are subject to five dif-
ferent states of suffering, represented by the letters pa, pha, ba, bha and
ma. Pa means parisrama, very hard labor. Pha means phena, or foam
from the mouth. For example, sometimes we see a horse foaming at the
mouth with heavy labor. Ba means byarthata, disappointment. In spite
of so much hard labor, at the end we find disappointment. Bha means
bhaya, or fear. In material life, one is always in the blazing fire of fear,
since no one knows what will happen next. Finally, ma means mrtyu, or
death. When one attempts to nullify these five different statuses of life—
pa, pha, ba, bha and ma—one achieves apavarga, or liberation from the
punishment of material existence.

The word tirascam refers to degraded life. Human life, of course, pro-
vides an opportunity for the best living conditions. As Western people
think, from the monkeys come the human beings, who are more comfor-
tably situated. However, if one does not utilize his human life for svarga
or apavarga, he falls again to the degraded life of animals like dogs and
hogs. Therefore a sane human being must consider whether he will ele-
vate himself to the higher planets, prepare to free himself from the
evolutionary process, or travel again through the evolutionary process in
higher and lower grades of life. If one works piously one may be elevated
to the higher planetary systems or achieve liberation and return home,
back to Godhead, but otherwise one may be degraded to a life as a dog, a
hog and so on. As explained in Bhagavad-gita (9.25), yanti deva-vrata
devan. Those interested in being elevated to the higher planetary

110 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 13
systems (Devaloka or Svargaloka) must prepare to do so. Similarly, if one
wants liberation and wants to return home, back to Godhead, he should
prepare himself for that purpose.

Our Krsna consciousness movement is therefore the highest move-
ment for the benediction of human society because this movement is
teaching people how to go back home, back to Godhead. In Bhagavad-
gita (13.22) it is clearly stated that different forms of life are obtained by
association with the three modes of material nature (karanam guna-
sango sya sad-asad-yoni-janmasu). According to one’s association with
the material qualities of goodness, passion and ignorance in this life, in
one’s next life one receives an appropriate body. Modern civilization does
not know that because of varied association in material nature, the living
entity, although eternal, is placed in different diseased conditions known
as the many species of life. Modern civilization is unaware of the laws of
nature.

“The bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of
material nature, thinks himself the performer of activities that are in ac-
tuality carried out by nature.” (Bg. 3.27) Every living entity is under
the full control of the stringent laws of material nature, but rascals think
themselves independent. Actually, however, they cannot be independent.
This is foolishness. A foolish civilization is extremely risky, and
therefore the Krsna consciousness movement is trying to make people
aware of their fully dependent condition under the stringent laws of
nature and is trying to save them from being victimized by strong maya,
which is Krsna’s external energy. Behind the material laws is the
supreme controller, Krsna (mayadhyaksena prakrtih 1
sacaracaram). Therefore if one surrenders unto Krsna (mam eva ye
prapadyante mayam 6277) taranti te), one may immediately be freed
from the control of external nature (sa gundan samatityaitan brahma-
bhayaya kalpate). This should be the aim of life.

TRANSLATION

In this human form of life, a man and women unite for the sen-
sual pleasure of sex, but by actual experience we have observed
that none of them are happy. Therefore, seeing the contrary
results, I have stopped taking part in materialistic activities.

PURPORT

As stated by Prahlada Maharaja, yan maithunadi-grhamedhi-sukham
hi tuccham. Man and woman both seek sexual enjoyment, and when they
are united by the ritualistic ceremony of marriage, they are happy for
some time, but finally there is dissension, and thus there are so many
cases of separation and divorce. Although every man and woman is ac-
tually eager to enjoy life through sexual unity, the result is disunity and
distress. Marriage is recommended to give men and women a concession
for restricted sex life, which is also recommended in Bhagavad-gita by
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Dharmaviruddho bhitesu kamo
’smi: sex life not against the principles of religion is Krsna. Every living
entity is always eager to enjoy sex life because materialistic life consists
of eating, sleeping, sex and fear. In animal life, eating, sleeping, sexual


--- Page 117 ---
112 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 13
enjoyment and fear cannot be regulated, but for human society the plan
is that although men, like animals, must be allowed to eat, sleep, enjoy
sex and take protection from fear, they must be regulated. The Vedic
plan for eating recommends that one take yajiia-Sista, or prasada, food
offered to Krsna. Yajiia-Sistasinah santo mucyante sarva-kilbisaih: “The
devotees of the Lord are released from all kinds of sins because they eat
food that is offered first for sacrifice.” (Bg. 3.13) In material life, one
commits sinful activities, especially in eating, and because of sinful ac-
tivities one is condemned by nature’s laws to accept another body, which
is imposed as punishment. Sex and eating are essential, and therefore
they are offered to human society under Vedic restrictions so that accord-
ing to the Vedic injunctions people may eat, sleep, enjoy sex, be protected
from fearful life and gradually be elevated and liberated from the
punishment of material existence. Thus the Vedic injunctions for mar-
riage offer a concession to human society, the idea being that a man and
woman united in a ritualistic marriage ceremony should help one
another advance in spiritual life. Unfortunately, especially in this age,
men and women unite for unrestricted sexual enjoyment. Thus they are
victimized, being obliged to take rebirth in the forms of animals to fulfill
their animalistic propensities. The Vedic injunctions therefore warn,
nayarin deho deha-bhajari nrloke kastan kaman arhate vid-bhujari ye.
One should not enjoy sex life like hogs, and eat everything, even to the
limit of stool. A human being should eat prasada offered to the Deity and
should enjoy sex life according to the Vedic injunctions. He should
engage himself in the business of Krsna consciousness, he should save
himself from the fearful condition of material existence, and he should
sleep only to recover from fatigue due to working hard.

The learned brahmana said that since everything is misused by
fruitive workers, he had retired from all fruitive activities.

TRANSLATION

The actual form of life for the living entities is one of spiritual
happiness, which is real happiness. This happiness can be achieved
only when one stops all materialistic activities. Material sense en-
joyment is simply imagination. Therefore, considering this subject
matter, I have ceased from all material activities and am lying down
here.

PURPORT

The difference between the philosophy of the Mayavadis and that of
the Vaisnavas is explained herein. Both the Mayavadis and Vaisnavas
know that in materialistic activities there is no happiness. The Mayavadi
philosophers, therefore, adhering to the slogan brahma satyari jagan
mithya, want to refrain from false, materialistic activities. They want to
stop all activities and merge in the Supreme Brahman. According to the
Vaisnava philosophy, however, if one simply ceases from materialistic
activity one cannot remain inactive for very long, and therefore everyone
should engage himself in spiritual activities, which will solve the
problem of suffering in this material world. It is said, therefore, that al-
though the Mayavadi philosophers strive to refrain from materialistic ac-
tivities and merge in Brahman, and although they may actually merge in
the Brahman existence, for want of activity they fall down again into ma-
terialistic activity (aruhya krcchrena [00707 padam tatah patanty
adhah). Thus the so-called renouncer, unable to remain in meditation
upon Brahman, returns to materialistic activities by opening hospitals


--- Page 119 ---
114 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 13
and schools and so on. Therefore, simply cultivating knowledge that ma-
terialistic activities cannot give one happiness, and that one should con-
sequently cease from such activities, is insufficient. One should cease
from materialistic activities and take up spiritual activities. Then the
solution to the problem will be achieved. Spiritual activities are activ-
ities performed according to the order of Krsna (anukilyena
krsnanustlanam). If one does whatever Krsna says, his activities are not
material. For example, when Arjuna fought in response to the order of
Krsna, his activities were not material. Fighting for sense gratification is
a materialistic activity, but fighting by the order of Krsna is spiritual. By
spiritual activities one becomes eligible to go back home, back to God-
head, and then enjoy blissful life eternally. Here, in the material world,
everything is but a mental concoction that will never give us real happi-
ness. The practical solution, therefore, is to cease from materialistic ac-
tivities and engage in spiritual activities. Yajiarthat karmano ’nyatra
loko yar karma-bandhanah. If one works for the sake of pleasing the
Supreme Lord — Yajiia, or Visnu—one is in liberated life. If one fails to
do so, however, he remains in a life of bondage.

TRANSLATION

In this way the conditioned soul living within the body forgets
his self-interest because he identifies himself with the body. Be-
cause the body is material, his natural tendency is to be attracted
by the varieties of the material world. Thus the living entity
suffers the miseries of material existence.

PURPORT

Everyone is trying to be happy because, as explained in the previous
verse, sukham asyatmano ripari sarvehoparatis tanuh: when the living
entity is in his original spiritual form, he is happy by nature. There is no
question of miseries for the spiritual being. As Krsna is always happy,
the living entities, who are His parts and parcels, are also happy by
nature, but because of being put within this material world and forget-
ting their eternal relationship with Krsna, they have forgotten their real
nature. Because every one of us is a part of Krsna, we have a very affec-
tionate relationship with Him, but because we have forgotten our iden-
tities and are considering the body to be the self, we are afflicted by all
the troubles of birth, death, old age and disease. This misconception in
materialistic life continues unless and until one comes to understand his
relationship with Krsna. The happiness sought by the conditioned soul is
certainly only illusion, as explained in the next verse.

Just as a deer, because of ignorance, cannot see the water within

a well covered by grass, but runs after water elsewhere, the living
entity covered by the material body does not see the happiness
within himself, but runs after happiness in the material world.

PURPORT

This is an accurate example depicting how the living entity, because of

lack of knowledge, runs after happiness outside his own self. When one
understands his real identity as a spiritual being, he can understand the
supreme spiritual being, Krsna, and the real happiness exchanged be-
tween Krsna and one’s self. It is very interesting to note how this verse
points to the body’s growth from the spirit soul. The modern ma-
terialistic scientist thinks that life grows from matter, but actually the
fact is that matter grows from life. The life, or the spiritual soul, is com-
pared herein to water, from which clumps of matter grow in the form of
grass. One who is ignorant of scientific knowledge of the spirit soul does
not look inside the body to find happiness in the soul; instead, he goes
outside to search for happiness, just as a deer without knowledge of the
water beneath the grass goes out to the desert to find water. The Krsna
consciousness movement is trying to remove the ignorance of misled
human beings who are trying to find water outside the jurisdiction of
life. Raso vai sah. Raso ’ham apsu kaunteya. The taste of water is Krsna.
To quench one’s thirst, one must taste water by association with Krsna.
This is the Vedic injunction.

TRANSLATION

The living entity tries to achieve happiness and rid himself of
the causes of distress, but because the various bodies of the living
entities are under the full control of material nature, all his plans
in different bodies, one after another, are ultimately baffled.

PURPORT

Because the materialist is in gross ignorance of how the laws of ma-
terial nature act upon him as a result of his fruitive activity, he
mistakenly plans to enjoy bodily comfort in the human form of life
through so-called economic development, through pious activities for
elevation to the higher planetary systems, and in many other ways, but
factually he becomes a victim of the reactions of his fruitive activities.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is situated as the Supersoul within
the cores of the hearts of all living entities. As the Lord says in
Bhagavad-gita (15.15):

sarvasya cahari hrdi sannivisto
mattah smrtir jidnam apohanari ca

“I am seated in everyone's heart, and from Me come remembrance,
knowledge and forgetfulness.” The desires and activities of the living
being are observed by the Supersoul, who is the upadrastd, the overseer,
and who orders material nature to fulfill the various desires of the living
being. As clearly stated in Bhagavad-gita (18.61):


--- Page 123 ---
118 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 13
Svarah sarva-bhiitanam
hrd-dese ’rjuna tisthati
bhramayan sarva-bhitani ’
yantrariudhani mayaya

The Lord is situated in everyone’s heart, and as one desires, the Lord
gives one various types of bodies, which are like machines. Riding on
such a machine, the living entity wanders throughout the universe,
under the control of material nature and its modes. Thus the living being
is not at all free to act, but is fully under the control of material nature,
which is fully under the control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

As soon as a living entity is victimized by material desires to lord it
over material nature, he is subjected to the control of material nature,
which is supervised by the Supreme Soul. The result is that one again
and again makes plans and is baffled, but as foolish as he is he cannot see
the cause of his bafflement. This cause is distinctly stated in Bhagavad-
gita: because one has not surrendered to the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, he must work under the control of material nature and its
stringent laws (daivi hy esa gunamayi mama mdya duratyayd). The
only means of becoming free from this entanglement is to surrender to
the Supreme Lord. In the human form of life, the living entity must ac-
cept this instruction from the Supreme Person, Krsna: sarva-dharman
parityajya mam ekarn saranari vraja. *‘Do not plan to achieve happiness
and drive away distress. You will never be successful. Simply surrender
unto Me.” Unfortunately, however, the living entity does not accept the
Supreme Lord’s clearly stated instructions from Bhagavad-gita, and thus
he becomes a perpetual captive of the laws of material nature.

Yajiarthat karmano ’nyatra loko yarn karma-bandhanah: if one
does not act for the satisfaction of Krsna, who is known as Visnu or
Yajiia, he must be entangled in the reactions of fruitive activities. These
reactions are called papa and punya—sinful and pious. By pious ac-
tivities one is elevated to the higher planetary systems, and by impious
activities one is degraded to lower species of life, in which he is punished
by the laws of nature. In the lower species of life there is an evolutionary
process, and when the term of the living entity’s imprisonment or
punishment in the lower species is finished, he is again offered a human
form and given a chance to decide for himself which way he should plan.

If he again misses the opportunity, he is again put into the cycle of birth
and death, going sometimes higher and sometimes lower, turning on the
sarmsara-cakra, the wheel of material existence. As a wheel sometimes
goes up and sometimes comes down, the stringent laws of material nature
make the living entity in material existence sometimes happy and some-
times distressed. How he suffers iu the cycle of happiness and distress is
described in the next verse.

TRANSLATION

Materialistic activities are always mixed with three kinds of
miserable conditions—adhyatmika, adhidaivika and adhibautika.
Therefore, even if one achieves some success by performing such
activities, what is the benefit of this success? One is still subjected
to birth, death, old age, disease and the reactions of his fruitive ac-
tivities.

PURPORT

According to the materialistic way of life, if a poor man, after laboring

very, very hard, gets some material profit at the end of his life, he is


--- Page 125 ---
120 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 13
considered a success, even though he again dies while suffering the
threefold miseries—adhyatmika, adhidaivika and adhibhautika. No one
can escape the threefold miseries of materialistic life, namely miseries
pertaining to the body and mind, miseries pertaining to the difficulties
imposed by society, community, nation and other living entities, and
miseries inflicted upon us by natural disturbances from earthquakes,
famines, droughts, floods, epidemics, and so on. If one works very hard,
suffering the threefold miseries, and then is successful in getting some
small benefit, what is the value of this benefit? Besides that, even if a
karmiis successful in accumulating some material wealth, he still cannot
enjoy it, for he must die in bereavement. I have even seen a dying man
begging a medical attendant to increase his life by four years so that he
could complete his material plans. Of course, the medical man was un-
successful in expanding the life of the man, who therefore died in great
bereavement. Everyone must die in this way, and after one’s mental con-
dition is taken into account by the laws of material nature, he is given
another chance to fulfill his desires in a different body. Material plans for
material happiness have no value, but under the spell of the illusory en-
ergy we consider them extremely valuable. There were many politicians,
social reformers and philosophers who died very miserably, without
deriving any practical value from their material plans. Therefore, a sane
and sensible man never desires to work hard under the conditions of
threefold miseries, only to die in disappointment.

TRANSLATION

The brahmana continued: I am actually seeing how a rich man,
who is a victim of his senses, is very greedy to accumulate wealth,
and therefore suffers from insomnia due to fear from all sides,
despite his wealth and opulence.

PURPORT

Greedy capitalists accumulate wealth under so many miserable condi-
tions, the result being that because they collect money by questionable
means, their minds are always agitated. Thus they are unable to sleep at
night, and they have to take pills for mental tranquility to invite sleep.
And sometimes even the pills are a failure. Consequently the result of
having accumulated money by so much labor is certainly not happiness,
but only distress. What is the value of acquiring a comfortable position if
one’s mind is always disturbed? Narottama dasa Thakura has therefore
sung:

samsara-bisanale, dibanisi hiya jvale,
Jjudaite na kainu upaya
“I am suffering from the poisonous effect of material enjoyment. Thus
my heart is always burning and is almost on the verge of failure.” The
result of the greedy capitalist’s unnecessary accumulation of wealth is
that he must suffer from a blazing fire of anxiety and always be con-
cerned with how to save his money and invest it properly to get more and
more. Such a life is certainly not very happy, but because of the spell of
the illusory energy, materialistic persons engage in such activities.

As far as our Krsna consciousness movement is concerned, we are get-
ting money naturally, by the grace of God, by selling our literature. This
literature is not sold fhr our sense gratification; to spread the Krsna con-
sciousness movement we need so many things, and Krsna is therefore
supplying us the requisite money to advance this mission. The mission of
Krsna is to spread Krsna consciousness all over the world, and for this


--- Page 127 ---
122 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 13
purpose we naturally must have sufficient money. Therefore, according
to the advice of Srila Ripa Gosvami Prabhupada, we should not give up
attachment to money that can spread the Krsna consciousness movement.
Srila Ripa Gosvami says in his Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu (1.2.256):
prapaiicikataya buddhya
hari-sambandhi-vastunah
mumuksubhih parityago
vairagyar phalgu kathyate
“When persons eager to achieve liberation renounce things which are re-
lated to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, though they are material,
this is called incomplete renunciation.”” Money that can help in spreading
the Krsna consciousness movement is not a part of the material world,
and we should not give it up, thinking that it is material. Srila Ripa
Gosvami advises:
anasaktasya visayan
yatharham upayunjatah
nirbandhah krsna-sambandhe
yuktarh vairagyam ucyate
“When one is not attached to anything, but at the same time accepts
everything in relation to Krsna, one is rightly situated above possessive-
ness.” (Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 1.2.255) Money is undoubtedly coming
in great quantities, but we should not be attached to this money for sense
gratification; every cent should be spent for spreading the Krsna con-
sciousness movement, not for sense gratification. There is danger for a
preacher when he receives great quantities of money, for as soon as he
spends even a single cent of the collection for his personal sense
gratification, he becomes a fallen victim. The preachers of the Krsna con-
sciousness movement should be extremely careful not to misuse the im-
mense quantities of money needed to spread this movement. Let us not
make this money the cause of our distress; it should be used for Krsna,
and that will cause our eternal happiness. Money is Laksmi, or the god-
dess of fortune, the companion of Narayana. Laksmiji must always
remain with Narayana, and then there need be no fear of degradation.

rajatah—from the government; cauratah—from thieves and rogues;
Satroh—from enemies; sva-jandt—from relatives; pasu-paksitah—from
animals and birds; arthibhyah—from beggars and persons seeking
charity; kalatah—from the time factor; svasmat—as well as from one’s

TRANSLATION

Those who are considered materially powerful and rich are al-
ways full of anxieties because of governmental laws, ककन and
rogues, enemies, family members, animals, birds, persons seeking
charity, the inevitable time factor and even their own selves. Thus
they are invariably afraid.

PURPORT

The word svasmat means “from one’s self.” Because of attachment for
money, the richest person is even afraid of himself. He fears that he may
have locked his money in an unsafe manner or might have committed
some mistake. Aside from the government and its income tax and aside
from thieves, even a rich man’s own relatives are always thinking of how
to take advantage of him and take away his money. Sometimes these rela-
tives are described as sva-janaka-dasyu, which means “rogues and
thieves in the guise of relatives.” Therefore, there is no need to accumu-
late wealth or unnecessarily endeavor for more and more money. The
real business of life is to ask “Who am 1?" and to understand one’s self.
One should understand the position of the living entity in this material
world and understand how to return home, back to Godhead.

TRANSLATION

Those in human society who are intelligent should give up the
original cause of lamentation, illusion, fear, anger, attachment,
poverty and unnecessary labor. The original cause of all of these is

the desire for unnecessary prestige and money.

PURPORT

Here is the difference between Vedic civilization and the modern
demoniac civilization. Vedic civilization concerned itself with how to
achieve self-realization, and for this purpose one was recommended to
have a small income to maintain body and soul together. The society was
divided into brahmanas, ksatriyas, vaiSyas and Siidras, and the members
of this society would limit their endeavors to meeting their minimum
demands. The brahmanas, in particular, would have no material desires.
Because the ksatriyas had to rule the people, it was necessary for them to
have money and prestige. But the vaiSyas were satisfied with agricultural
produce and milk from the cow, and if by chance there were excess,
trade was allowed. The $00705 were also happy, for they would get food
and shelter from the three higher classes. In the demoniac civilization of
the present day, however, there is no question of brahmanas or


--- Page 130 ---
Text 34] The Behavior of a Perfect Person 125
ksatriyas; there are only so-called workers and a flourishing mercantile
class who have no goal in life.

According to Vedic civilization, the ultimate perfection of life is to take
sannyasa, but at the present moment people do not know why sannyasa
is accepted. Because of misunderstanding, they think that one accepts
sannydsa to escape social responsibilities. But one does not accept
sannyasa to escape from responsibility to society. Generally one accepts
sannydasa at the fourth stage of spiritual life. One begins as a brahmacari
then becomes a grhastha, a vanaprastha and finally a sannyasi to take
advantage of the duration of one’s life by engaging oneself fully in self-
realization. Sannyasa does not mean begging from door to door to ac-
cumulate money for sense gratification. However, because in Kali-yuga
people are more or less prone to sense gratification, immature sannydsa
is not recommended. Srila Ripa Gosvami writes in his Nectar of Instruc-
tion (2):

atyaharah prayasas ca
prajalpo niyamagrahah
jana-sangas ca laulyam ca
sadbhir bhaktir vinasyati
“One’s devotional service is spoiled when he becomes too entangled in
the following six activities: (1) eating more than necessary or collecting
more funds than required; (2) overendeavoring for mundane things
that are very difficult to obtain; (3) talking unnecessarily about mun-
dane subject matters; (4) practicing the scriptural rules and regulations
only for the sake of following them and not for the sake of spiritual ad-
vancement, or rejecting the rules and regulations of the scriptures and
working independently or whimsically; (5) associating with worldly-
minded persons who are not interested in Krsna consciousness; and
(6) being greedy for mundane achievements.” A sannydasi should have
an institution meant to preach Krsna consciousness; he need not ac-
cumulate money for himself. We recommend that as soon as money ac-
cumulates in our Krsna consciousness movement, fifty per cent of it
should be invested in printing books, and fifty per cent for expenditures,
especially in establishing centers all over the world. The managers of the
Krsna consciousness movement should be extremely cautious in regard
to this point. Otherwise money will be the cause of lamentation, illusion,


--- Page 131 ---
126 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 13
fear, anger, material attachment, material poverty, and unnecessary
hard work. When I was alone in Vrndavana, I never attempted to con-
struct mathas or temples; rather, I was fully satisfied with the small
amount of money I could gather by selling Back to Godhead, and thus I
would provide for myself and also print the literature. When I went to
foreign countries, I lived according to the same principle, but when
Europeans and Americans began to give money profusely, I started tem-
ples and Deity worship. The same principle should still be followed.
Whatever money is collected should be spent for Krsna, and not a
farthing for sense gratification. This is the Bhagavata principle.

TRANSLATION
From the bumblebee I have learned to be unattached to ac-
cumulating money, for although money is as good as honey, any-
one can kill its owner and take it away.
PURPORT
The honey gathered in the comb is taken away by force. Therefore one
who accumulates money should realize that he may be harassed by the
government or by thieves or even killed by enemies. Especially in this
age of Kali-yuga, it is said that instead of protecting the money of the
citizens, the government itself will take away the money with the force of
law. The learned brahmana had therefore decided that he should not ac-
cumulate any money. One should own as much as he immediately needs.
There is no need to keep a big balance at hand, along with the fear that it
may be plundered by the government or by thieves.

I do not endeavor to get anything, but am satisfied with whatever

PURPORT
One should learn detachment from the bumblebees, for they collect
drops of honey here and there and keep it in their honeycomb, but then
someone comes and by force takes all the honey away, leaving the
bumblebees with nothing. Therefore one should learn from the
bumblebee not to keep more money than one needs. Similarly, one
should learn from the python to stay in one place for many, many days
without food and then eat only if something comes in its own way. Thus
the learned brahmana gave instructions gained from two creatures,
namely the bumblebee and the python.

PURPORT
The learned brahmana’s description indicates different types of
births, for one lies down according to one’s body. Sometimes one takes
birth as an animal and sometimes as a king. When he takes birth as an
animal he must lie down on the ground, and when he takes birth as a
king or a very rich man he is allowed to lie in first-class rooms in huge
palaces decorated with beds and other furniture. Such facilities are not
available, however, at the sweet will of the living entity; rather, they are


--- Page 136 ---
Text 41] The Behavior of a Perfect Person 131
available by the supreme will (parecchaya), or by the arrangement of
maya. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (18.61):
Svarah sarva-bhitanam
hrd-dese ’rjuna tisthati
bhramayan sarva-bhitani
yantraridhani mayaya
“The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone’s heart, O Arjuna, and is
directing the wanderings of all living entities, who are seated as on a
machine, made of the material energy.” The living entity, according to
his material desires, receives different types of bodies, which are nothing
but machines offered by material nature according to the order of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. By the will of the Supreme, one must
take different bodies with different means for lying down.

Different people are of different mentalities. Therefore it is not
my business either to praise them or to blaspheme them. I only
desire their welfare, hoping that they will agree to become one
with the Supersoul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna.
PURPORT

As soon as one comes to the platform of bhakti-yoga, one understands
fully the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vasudeva, is the goal of life
(vasudevah sarvam iti sa mahatma sudurlabhah). This is the instruction
of all the Vedic literature (vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah, sarva
dharman parityajya mam ekam $aranari vraja). There is no use in
praising someone for material qualifications or blaspheming him for ma-
terial disqualifications. In the material world, good and bad have no
meaning because if one is good he may be elevated to a higher planetary
system and if one is bad he may be degraded to the lower planetary
systems. People of different mentalities are sometimes elevated and


--- Page 138 ---
Text 43] The Behavior of a Perfect Person 133
sometimes degraded, but this is not the goal of life. Rather, the goal of
life is to become free from elevation and degradation and take to Krsna
consciousness. Therefore a saintly person does not discriminate between
that which is supposedly good and supposedly bad; rather, he desires for
everyone to be happy in Krsna consciousness, which is the ultimate goal
of life.

The mental concoction of discrimination between good and bad
should be accepted as one unit and then invested in the mind,
which should then be invested in the false ego. The false ego
should be invested in the total material energy. This is the process
of fighting false discrimination.

PURPORT

This verse describes how a yogi can become free from material affec-
tion. Because of material attraction, a karmi cannot see himself. Jianis
can discriminate between matter and spirit, but the yogis, the best of


--- Page 139 ---
134 Srimad-Bhiagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 13
whom are the bhakti-yogis, want to return home, back to Godhead. The
karmis are completely in illusion, the jiianis are neither in illusion nor in
positive knowledge, but the yogis, especially the bhakti-yogis, are com-
pletely on the spiritual platform. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita
(14.26):
mar ca yo ’vyabhicarena
bhakti-yogena sevate
sa gunan samatityaitan
brahma-bhityaya kalpate
“One who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down
under any circumstance, at once transcends the modes of material nature
and thus comes to the level of Brahman.” Thus a devotee’s position is
secure. A devotee is at once elevated to the spiritual platform. Others,
such as jAianis and hatha-yogts, can only gradually ascend to the spiritual
platform by nullifying their material discrimination on the platform of
psychology and nullifying the false ego, by which one thinks, “I am this
body, a product of matter.” One must merge the false ego into the total
material energy and merge the total material energy into the supreme
energetic. This is the process of becoming free from material attraction.

. TRANSLATION

A learned, thoughtful person must realize that material exis-
tence is illusion. This is possible only by self-realization. A self-
realized person, who has actually seen the truth, should retire
from all material activities, being situated in self-realization.

PURPORT

By an analytical study of the entire constitution of the body, one can
surely come to the conclusion that the soul is different from all the
body’s material constituents, such as earth, water, fire and air. Thus the
difference between the body and soul can be realized by a person who is
thoughtful (manisi or muni), and after this realization of the individual
spirit soul one can very easily understand the supreme spirit soul. If one
thus realizes that the individual soul is subordinate to the supreme spirit
soul, he achieves self-realization. As explained in the Thirteenth Chapter
of Bhagavad-gitd, there are two souls within the body. The body is called
ksetra, and there are two ksetra-jiias, or occupants of the body, namely
the Supersoul (Paramitmai) and the individual soul. The Supersoul and
the individual soul are like two birds sitting on the same tree (the ma-
terial body). One bird, the individual, forgetful bird, is eating the fruit
of the tree, not caring for the instructions of the other bird, which is only
a witness to the activities of the first bird, who is his friend. When the
forgetful bird comes to understand the supreme friend who is always
with him and trying to give him guidance in different bodies, he takes
shelter at the lotus feet of that supreme bird. As explained in the yoga
process, dhyandavasthita-tad-gatena manasa pasyanti yar yoginah.
When one actually becomes a perfect yogi, by meditation he can see the
supreme friend and surrender unto Him. This is the beginning of
bhakti-yoga, or actual life in Krsna consciousness.

TRANSLATION

Prahlada Maharaja, you are certainly a self-realized soul and a
devotee of the Supreme Lord. You do not care for public opinion
or so-called scriptures. For this reason I have described to you
without hesitation the history of my self-realization.

PURPORT

A person who is actually a devotee of Krsna does not care about so-
called public opinion and Vedic or philosophical literatures. Prahlada
Maharaja, who is such a devotee, always defied the false instructions of
his father and the so-called teachers who were appointed to teach him.
Instead, he simply followed the instructions of Narada Muni, his guru,
and thus he always remained a stalwart devotee. This is the nature
of an intelligent devotee. The Srimad-Bhagavatam instructs, yajiaih
sarikirtana-prayair yajanti hi sumedhasah. One who is actually very in-
telligent must join the Krsna consciousness movement, realizing his own
self as an eternal servant of Krsna, and thus practice constant chanting of
the holy name of the Lord —Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare
Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rima Rama, Hare Hare.

Narada Muni continued: After Prahlada Maharaja, the King of
the demons, heard these instructions from the saint, he under-
stood the occupational duties of a perfect person [paramaharnsa].
Thus he duly worshiped the saint, took his permission and then
left for his own home.
PURPORT
As quoted in Caitanya-caritamrta (Madhya 8.128), Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu said:
kiba vipra, kiba nyasi, Sidra kene naya
yei krsna-tattva-vetta sei ‘guru’ haya
A guru, or spiritual master, can be anyone who is well conversant with
the science of Krsna. Therefore although Prahlada Maharaja was a
grhastha ruling over the demons, he was a paramaharisa, the best of
human beings, and thus he is our guru. In the list of gurus, or authori-
ties, Prahlada Maharaja’s name is therefore mentioned:
svayambhir naradah sambhuh
kumarah kapilo manuh

prahlado janako bhismo
balir vaiyasakir vayam
(Bhag. 6.3.20)

The conclusion is that a paramaharisa is an exalted devotee (bhagavat-
priya). Such a paramahariisa may be in any stage of life—brahmacari,
grhastha, vanaprastha or sannyasa—and be equally liberated and ex-
alted.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Seventh Canto, Thirteenth
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “The Behavior of a Perfect
Person.”

CHAPTER FOURTEEN

Ideal Family Life
This chapter describes the occupational duties of the householder accord-
ing to the time, the country and the performer. When Yudhisthira
Maharaja became very much inquisitive about the occupational duties for
the householder, Narada Muni advised him that a grhastha’s first duty is
to be fully dependent on Vasudeva, Krsna, and to try to satisfy Him in all
respects by executing one’s prescribed devotional service. This devo-
tional service will depend on the instructions of authorities and the asso-
ciation of devotees who are actually engaged in devotional service. The
beginning of devotional service is Sravanam, or hearing. One must hear
from the mouths of realized souls. In this way the grhastha’s attraction to
his wife and children will gradually be reduced.

As for the maintenance of his family, a grhastha, while earning what
he requires for his living, must be very conscientious and must not un-
dergo extraordinary endeavor simply to accumulate money and unneces-
sarily increase in material comforts. Although a grhastha should
externally be very active in earning his livelihood, he should internally
be situated as a fully self-realized person, without attachment for ma-
terial gains. His dealings with family members or friends should be per-
formed simply to fulfill their purpose; one should not be extravagantly
engaged in this way. Instructions from family members and society
should be accepted superficially, but in essence the grhastha should be
engaged in occupational duties advised by the spiritual master and astra.
Specifically a grhastha should engage in agricultural activities to earn
money. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (18.44), krsi-go-raksya-vanijyam—
agriculture, cow protection and trade—are special duties of grhasthas. If
by chance or by the grace of the Lord more money comes, it should be
properly engaged for the Krsna consciousness movement. One should not
be eager to earn more money simply for sensual pleasure. A grhastha
should always remember that one who is endeavoring to accumulate
more money than necessary is to be considered a thief and is punishable
by the laws of nature.

140 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 14

A grhastha should be very much affectionate toward lower animals,
birds and bees, treating them exactly like his own children. A grhastha
should not indulge in killing animals or birds for sense gratification. He
should provide the necessities of life even to the dogs and the lowest
creatures and should not exploit others for sense gratification. Factually,
according to the instructions of Srimad-Bhagavatam, every grhastha is a
great communist who provides the means of living for everyone. What-
ever a grhastha may possess he should equally distribute to all living en-
tities, without discrimination. The best process is to distribute prasada.

A grhastha should not be very much attached to his wife; he should
engage even his own wife in serving a guest with all attention. Whatever
money a grhastha accumulates by the grace of God he should spend in
five activities, namely worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
receiving Vaisnavas and saintly persons, distributing prasada to the
general public and to all living entities, offering prasada to his
forefathers, and also offering prasada to his own self. Grhasthas should
always be ready to worship everyone as mentioned above. The grhastha
should not eat anything not offered to the Supreme Personality of God-
head. As it is said in the Bhagavad-gita (3.13), yajiia-§istasinah santo
mucyante sarva-kilbisaih: “The devotees of the Lord are released from
all kinds of sins because they eat food that is offered first for sacrifice.”
The grhastha should also visit the holy places of pilgrimage mentioned in
the Puranas. In this way he should fully engage in worshiping the
Supreme Personality of Godhead for the benefit of his family, his society,
his country, and humanity at large.

TRANSLATION

Maharaja Yudhisthira inquired from Narada Muni: O my lord, O
great sage, kindly explain how we who are staying at home without
knowledge of the goal of life may also easily attain liberation, ac-
cording to the instructions of the Vedas.

PURPORT

In the previous chapters the great sage Narada has explained how a
brahmacari, a vanaprastha and a sannyast should act. He first explained
the dealings of a brahmacart, vanaprastha and sannyasi because these
three asramas, or statuses of life, are extremely important for fulfillment
of the goal of life. One should note that in the brahmacari-asrama,
vanaprastha-asrama and sannyasa-asrama there is no scope for sex life,
whereas sex is allowed in grhastha life under regulations. Narada Muni,
therefore, first described brahmacarya, vanaprastha and sannyasa be-
cause he wanted to stress that sex is not at all necessary, although one
who absolutely requires it is allowed to enter grhastha life, or household
life, which is also regulated by the sastras and guru. Yudhisthira
Maharaja could understand all this. Therefore, as a grhastha, he pre-
sented himself as grha-miidha-dhih, one who is completely ignorant of
the goal of life. A person who remains a householder in family life is cer-
tainly ignorant of life’s goal; he is not very much advanced in intelli-
gence. As soon as possible, one should give up his so-called comfortable
life at home and prepare to undergo austerity, or tapasya. Tapo divyam
putraka. According to the instructions given by Rsabhadeva to His sons,
we should not create a so-called comfortable situation, but must prepare
to undergo austerity. This is how a human being should actually live to
fulfill life’s ultimate goal.

TRANSLATION
Narada Muni replied: My dear King, those who stay at home as
householders must act to earn their livelihood, and instead of try-
ing to enjoy the results of their work themselves, they should offer
these results to Krsna, Vasudeva. How to satisfy Vasudeva in this
life can be perfectly understood through the association of great
devotees of the Lord.
PURPORT
The format for grhastha life should be dedication to the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead. In Bhagavad-gita (6.1) it is said:
andsritah karma-phalar
karyar karma karoti yah
sa sannyasi ca yogi ca
na niragnir na cakriyah


--- Page 148 ---
Text 4] Ideal Family Life 143
“One who is unattached to the fruits of his work and who works as he is
obligated is in the renounced order of life, and he is the true mystic, not
he who lights no fire and performs no work.” Whether one acts as a
brahmacari, grhastha, vanaprastha or sannyasi, he must act only for the
satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vasudeva—Krsna,
the son of Vasudeva. This should be the principle for everyone's life.
Narada Muni has already described the principles of life for a
brahmacari, vanaprastha and sannyast, and now he is describing how a
grhastha should live. The basic principle is to satisfy the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead.

The science of satisfying the Supreme Lord can be learned as de-
scribed here: saksad upasita maha-munin. The word maha-munin
refers to great saintly persons or devotees. Saintly persons are generally
known as munis, or thoughtful philosophers concerned with transcen-
dental subject matters, and maha-munin refers to those who have not
only thoroughly studied the goal of life but who are actually engaged in
satisfying the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vasudeva. These persons
are known as devotees. Unless one associates with devotees, one cannot
learn the science of vasudevarpana, or dedicating one’s life to Vasudeva,
Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

In India the principles of this science were followed strictly. Even fifty
years ago, I saw that in the villages of Bengal and the suburbs of
Calcutta, people engaged in hearing Srimad-Bhagavatam daily when all
their activities ended, or at least in the evening before going to bed.
Everyone would hear the Bhagavatam. Bhagavata classes were held in
every village, and thus people had the advantage of hearing Srimad-
Bhagavatam, which describes everything about the aim of life —libera-
tion or salvation. This will be clearly explained in the next verses.

TRANSLATION
A grhastha must associate again and again with saintly persons,
and with great respect he must hear the nectar of the activities of
the Supreme Lord and His incarnations as these activities are de-
scribed in Srimad-Bhagavatam and other Puranas. Thus one
should gradually become detached from affection for his wife and
children, exactly like a man awakening from a dream.
PURPORT
The Krsna consciousness movement has been established to give
grhasthas all over the world an opportunity to hear Srimad-Bhagavatam
and Bhagavad-gita specifically. The process, as described in many ways,
is one of hearing and chanting (Srnvatam sva-kathah krsnah punya-
Sravana-kirtanah). Everyone, especially the grhasthas, who are midha-
dhi, ignorant about the goal of life, should be given opportunities to hear


--- Page 150 ---
Text 4] Ideal Family Life 145
about Krsna. Simply by hearing, by attending lectures in the different
centers of the Krsna consciousness movement, where topics of Krsna
from Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam are discussed, they will be
purified of their sinful inclination for constant indulgence in illicit sex,
meat-eating, intoxication and gambling, which have all become promi-
nent in modern days. Thus they can be raised to the status of light.
Punya-sravana-kirtanah. Simply by joining the kirtana—Hare Krsna,
Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rima, Rima
Rama, Hare Hare—and by hearing about Krsna from Bhagavad-gita,
one must be purified, especially if he also takes prasada. This is all going
on in the Krsna consciousness movement.

Another specific description here is Srnvan bhagavato ’bhiksnam
avatara-kathamrtam. It is not that because one has once finished
Bhagavad-gita he should not hear it again. The word abhiksnam is very
important. We should hear again and again. There is no question of stop-
ping: even if one has read these topics many times, he should go on read-
ing again and again because bhagavat-katha, the words spoken by Krsna
and spoken by Krsna’s devotees about Krsna, are amrtam, nectar. The
more one drinks this amrtam, the more he advances in his eternal life.

The human form of life is meant for liberation, but unfortunately,
due to the influence of Kali-yuga, every day the grhasthas are working
hard like asses. Early in the morning they rise and travel even a hundred
miles away to earn bread. Especially in the Western countries, I have
seen that people awaken at five o’clock to go to offices and factories to
earn their livelihood. People in Calcutta and Bombay also do this every
day. They work very hard in the office or factory, and again they spend
three or four hours in transportation returning home. Then they retire at
ten o’clock and again rise early in the morning to go to their offices and
factories. This kind of hard labor is described in the Sastras as the life of
pigs and stool-eaters. Nayar deho deha-bhajari nrioke kastan kaman
arhate vid-bhujari ye: “Of all living entities who have accepted material
bodies in this world, one who has been awarded this human form should
not work hard day and night simply for sense gratification, which is
available even for dogs and hogs that eat stool.” (Bhag. 5.5.1) One must
find some time for hearing Srimad-Bhagavatam and Bhagavad-gita.
This is Vedic culture. One should work eight hours at the most to earn
his livelihood, and either in the afternoon or in the evening a house-
holder should associate with devotees to hear about the incarnations of


--- Page 151 ---
146 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 14
Krsna and His activities and thus be gradually liberated from the
clutches of maya. However, instead of finding time to hear about Krsna,
the householders, after working hard in offices and factories, find time to
go to a restaurant or a club where instead of hearing about Krsna and His
activities they are very much pleased to hear about the political activities
of demons and nondevotees and to enjoy sex, wine, women and meat and
in this way waste their time. This is not grhastha life, but demoniac life.
The Krsna consciousness movement, however, with its centers all over
the world, gives such fallen and condemned persons an opportunity to
hear about Krsna.

In a dream we form a society of friendship and love, and when we
awaken we see that it has ceased to exist. Similarly, one’s gross society,
family and love are also a dream, and this dream will be over as soon as
one dies. Therefore, whether one is dreaming in a subtle way or a gross
way, these dreams are all false and temporary. One’s real business is to
understand that one is soul (aham brahmasmi) and that his activities
should therefore be different. Then one can be happy.

“One who is transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme
Brahman and becomes fully joyful. He never laments nor desires to have
anything; he is equally disposed toward all living entities. In that state he
attains pure devotional service unto Me.” (Bg. 18.54) One who is
engaged in devotional service can very easily be liberated from the
dream of materialistic life.

TRANSLATION
While working to earn his livelihood as much as necessary to
maintain body and soul together, one who is actually learned
should live in human society unattached to family affairs, although

externally appearing very much attached.

PURPORT

This is the picture of ideal family life. When Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu
asked Ramananda Raya about the goal of life, Raimananda Raya described
it in different ways, according to the recommendations of the revealed
scriptures, and finally Sri Ramananda Raya explained that one may stay
in his own position, whether as a brahmana, a Sidra, a sanmyasi or what-
ever, but one must try to inquire about life’s goal (athato brahma-
jijisasa). This is the proper utilization of the human form of life. When
one misuses the gift of the human form by unnecessarily indulging in
the animal propensities of eating, sleeping, mating and defending and
does not try to get out of the clutches of maya, which subjects one to
repeated birth, death, old age and disease, one is again punished by being
forced to descend to the lower species and undergo evolution according to
the laws of nature. Prakrteh kriyamanani gunaih karmani sarvasah.
Being completely under the grip of material nature, the living entity
must evolve again from the lower species to the higher species until he at
last returns to human life and gets the chance to be freed from the ma-
terial clutches. A wise man, however, learns from the sastras and guru
that we living entities are all eternal but are put into troublesome condi-
tions because of associating with different modes under the laws of ma-
terial nature. He therefore concludes that in the human form of life he


--- Page 153 ---
148 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 14.
should not endeavor for unnecessary necessities, but should live a very
simple life, just maintaining body and soul together. Certainly one re-
quires some means of livelihood, and according to one’s varna and
asrama this means of livelihood is prescribed in the sastras. One should
be satisfied with this. Therefore, instead of hankering for more and more
money, a sincere devotee of the Lord tries to invent some ways to earn
his livelihood, and when he does so Krsna helps him. Earning one’s
livelihood, therefore, is not a problem. The real problem is how to get
free from the bondage of birth, death and old age. Attaining this
freedom, and not inventing unnecessary necessities, is the basic principle
of Vedic civilization. One should be satisfied with whatever means of life
comes automatically. The modern materialistic civilization is just the op-
posite of the ideal civilization. Every day the so-called leaders of modern
society invent something contributing to a cumbersome way of life that
implicates people more and more in the cycle of birth, death, old age and
disease.

The natural products created by the Supreme Personality of
Godhead should be utilized to maintain the bodies and souls of all
living entities. The necessities of life are of three types: those pro-
duced from the sky [from rainfall], from the earth [from the
mines, the seas or the fields], and from the atmosphere [that which
is obtained suddenly and unexpectedly].
PURPORT
We living entities in different forms are all children of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, as confirmed by the Lord in Bhagavad-gita
(14.4):


--- Page 155 ---

“It should be understood that all species of life, O son of Kunti, are made
possible by birth in this material nature, and that I am the seed-giving
father.” The Supreme Lord, Krsna, is the father of all living entities in
different species and forms. One who is intelligent can see that all living
entities in the 8,400,000 bodily forms are part of the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead and are His sons. Everything within the material and
spiritual worlds is the property of the Supreme Lord (#avasyam idam
sarvam), and therefore everything has a relationship with Him. Srila
Ripa Gosvami says in this regard:
prapancikataya buddhya
hari-sambandhi-vastunah
mumuksubhih parityago
vairagyari phalgu kathyate
“One who rejects anything without knowledge of its relation-
ship to Krsna is incomplete in his renunciation.” (Bhakti-rasamrta-
sindhu 1.2.256) Although Mayavadi philosophers say that the material
creation is false, actually it is not false; it is factual, but the idea that
everything belongs to human society is false. Everything belongs to the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, for everything is created by Him. All
living entities, being the Lord’s sons, His eternal parts and parcels, have
the right to use their father’s property by nature’s arrangement. As
stated in the Upanisads, tena tyaktena bhunjitha ma grdhah kasya svid
dhanam. Everyone should be satisfied with the things allotted him by the
Supreme Personality of Godhead; no one should encroach upon another’s
rights or property.
In Bhagavad-gita it is said:

*“All living bodies subsist on food grains, which are produced from rains.
Rains are produced by performance of yajiia [sacrifice], and yajiia is
born of prescribed duties.” (Bg. 3.14) When food grains are sufficiently
produced, both animals and human beings can be nourished without dif-
ficulty for their maintenance. This is nature’s arrangement. Prakrteh
kriyamanani gunaih karmani sarvasah. Everyone is acting under the in-
fluence of material nature, and only fools think they can improve upon
what God has created. The householders are specifically responsible for
seeing that the laws of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are main-
tained, without fighting between men, communities, societies or nations.
Human society should properly utilize the gifts of God, especially the
food grains that grow because of rain falling from the sky. As stated in
Bhagavad-gita, yajiiad bhavati parjanyah. So that rainfall will be regu-
lated, humanity should perform yajias, sacrifices. Yajiias were pre-
viously performed with offerings of oblations of ghee and food grains,
but in this age, of course, this is no longer possible, for the production of
ghee and food grains has diminished because of the sinful life of human
society. However, people should take to Krsna consciousness and chant
the Hare Krsna mantra, as recommended in the 5050705 (yajiiaih
sanikirtana-prayair yajanti hi sumedhasah). If people throughout the
world take to the Krsna consciousness movement and chant the easy
sound vibration of the transcendental name and fame of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, there will be no scarcity of rainfall; conse-
quently food grains, fruits and flowers will be properly produced, and all
the necessities of life will be easily obtained. Grhasthas, or householders,
should take the responsibility for organizing such natural production. It
is therefore said, tasyaiva hetoh prayateta kovidah. An intelligent person
should try to spread Krsna consciousness through the chanting of the
holy name of the Lord, and all the necessities of life will automatically
follow.

One may claim proprietorship to as much wealth as required to

PURPORT
By God’s favor we sometimes get large quantities of food grains or
suddenly receive some contribution or unexpected profit in business. In
this way we may get more money than needed. So, how should that be
spent? There is no need to accumulate money in the bank merely to in-
crease one’s bank balance. Such a mentality is described in Bhagavad-
gita (16.13) as asuric, demoniac.

“The demoniac person thinks, ‘So much wealth do I have today, and I
will gain more according to my schemes. So much is mine now, and it
will increase in the future, more and more.” The asura is concerned
with how much wealth he has in the bank today and how it will increase
tomorrow, but unrestricted accumulation of wealth is not permitted
either by the astra or, in the modern age, by the government. Actually,
if one has more than one requires for his necessities, the extra money
should be spent for Krsna. According to the Vedic civilization. it should

all be given to the Krsna consciousness movement, as ordered by the
Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gita (9.27):
yat karosi yad asnasi
20] juhosi dadasi yat
yat tapasyasi kaunteya
tat kurusva mad-arpanam
“0 son of Kunti, all that you do, all that you eat, all that you offer and
give away, as well as all austerities that you may perform, should be done
as an offering unto Me.” Grhasthas should spend extra money only for
the Krsna consciousness movement.

The grhasthas should give contributions for constructing temples of
the Supreme Lord and for preaching of Srimad Bhagavad-gita, or Krsna
consciousness, all over the world. Srnvan bhagavato *bhiksnam avatara-
kathamrtam. In the Sastras—the Puranas and other Vedic literatures —
there are so many narrations describing the transcendental activities of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and everyone should hear them
again and again. For example, even if we read the entire Bhagavad-gita
every day, all eighteen chapters, in each reading we shall find a new ex-
planation. That is the nature of transcendental literature. The Krsna con-
sciousness movement therefore affords one an opportunity to spend his
extra earnings for the benefit of all human society by expanding Krsna
consciousness. In India especially we see hundreds and thousands of tem-
ples that were constructed by the wealthy men of society who did not
want to be called thieves and be punished.

This verse is very important. As stated here, one who accumulates
more money than needed is a thief, and by the laws of nature he will be
punished. One who acquires more money than necessary becomes
desirous of enjoying material comforts more and more. Materialists are
inventing so many artificial necessities, and those who have money,
being allured by such artificial necessities, try to accumulate money to
possess more and more. This is the idea of modern economic develop-
ment. Everyone is engaged in earning money, and the money is kept in
the bank, which then offers money to the public. In this cycle of ac-
tivities, everyone is engaged in getting more and more money, and
therefore the ideal goal of human life is being lost. Concisely, it may be


--- Page 159 ---
154 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 14
said that everyone is a thief and is liable to be punished. Punishment by
the laws of nature takes place in the cycle of birth and death. No one dies
fully satisfied by the fulfillment of material desires, for that is not possi-
ble. Therefore at the time of one’s death one is very sorry, being unable
to fulfill his desires. By the laws of nature one is then offered another
body to fulfill his unsatisfied desires, and upon taking birth again, ac-
cepting another material body, one voluntarily accepts the threefold mis-
eries of life.

One should treat animals such as deer, camels, asses, monkeys,

animals.
PURPORT
One who is in Krsna consciousness understands that there is no dif-
ference between the animals and the innocent children in one’s home.
Even in ordinary life, it is our practical experience that a household dog
or cat is regarded on the same level as one’s children, without any envy.
Like children, the unintelligent animals are also sons of the Supreme


--- Page 160 ---
Text 10] Ideal Family Life 155
Personality of Godhead, and therefore a Krsna conscious person, even
though a householder, should not discriminate between children and
poor animals. Unfortunately, modern society has devised many means
for killing animals in different forms of life. For example, in the
agricultural fields there may be many mice, flies and other creatures that
disturb production, and sometimes they are killed by pesticides. In this
verse, however, such killing is forbidden. Every living entity should be
nourished by the food given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Human society should not consider itself the only enjoyer of all the prop-
erties of God; rather, men should understand that all the other animals
also have a claim to God’s property. In this verse even the snake is men-
tioned, indicating that a householder should not be envious even of a
snake. If everyone is fully satisfied by eating food that is a gift from the
Lord, why should there be envy between one living being and another?
In modern days people are very much inclined toward communistic ideas
of society, but we do not think that there can be any better communistic
idea than that which is explained in this verse of Srimad-Bhagavatam.
Even in the communistic countries the poor animals are killed without
consideration, although they also should have the right to take their
allotted food with which to live.

156 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 14
TRANSLATION

Even if one is a householder rather than a brahmacari, a
sannyasi or a vanaprastha, one should not endeavor very hard for
religiosity, economic development or satisfaction of the senses.
Even in householder life, one should be satisfied to maintain body
and soul together with whatever is available with minimum en-
deavor, according to place and time, by the grace of the Lord. One
should not engage oneself in ugra-karma.

PURPORT

In human life there are four principles to be fulfilled —dharma,
artha, kama and moksa (religion, economic development, sense gratifica-
tion, and liberation). First one should be religious, observing various
rules and regulations, and then one must earn some money for
maintenance of his family and the satisfaction of his senses. The
most important ceremony for sense gratification is marriage because sex-
ual intercourse is one of the principal necessities of the material body.
Yan maithunadi-grhamedhi-sukhari hi tuccham. Although sexual inter-
course is not a very exalted requisite in life, both animals and men re-
quire some sense gratification because of material propensities. One
should be satisfied with married life and not expend energy for extra
sense gratification or sex life.

As for economic development, the responsibility for this should be en-
trusted mainly to the vaiSyas and grhasthas. Human society should be
divided into varnas and asramas—brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya, ऽद्वा,
brahmacarya, grhastha, vanaprastha and sannyasa. Economic develop-
ment is necessary for grhasthas. Brahmana grhasthas should be satisfied
with a life of adhyayana, adhyapana, yajana and ydajana—being
learned scholars, teaching others to be scholars, learning how to worship
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu, and also teaching others
how to worship Lord Visnu, or even the demigods. A brahmana should
do this without remuneration, but he is allowed to accept charity from a
person whom he teaches how to be a human being. As for the ksatriyas,
they are supposed to be the kings of the land, and the land should be dis-
tributed to the wvaiSyas for agricultural activities, cow protection and
trade. Sidras must work; sometimes they should engage in occupational


--- Page 162 ---
Text 11] Ideal Family Life 157
duties as cloth manufacturers, weavers, blacksmiths, goldsmiths, brass-
smiths, and so on, or else they should engage in hard labor to produce
food grains.

These are the different occupational duties by which men should earn
their livelihood, and in this way human society should be simple. At the
present moment, however, everyone is engaged in technological ad-
vancement, which is described in Bhagavad-gita as ugra-karma—ex-
tremely severe endeavor. This ugra-karma is the cause of agitation
within the human mind. Men are engaging in many sinful activities and
becoming degraded by opening slaughterhouses, breweries and cigarette
factories, as well as nightclubs and other establishments for sense enjoy-
ment. In this way they are spoiling their lives. In all of these activities, of
course, householders are involved, and therefore it is advised here, with
the use of the word api, that even though one is a householder, one
should not engage himself in severe hardships. One’s means of livelihood
should be extremely simple. As for those who are not grhasthas—the
brahmacaris, vanaprasthas and sannyasis—they don’t have to do any-
thing but strive for advancement in spiritual life. This means that three
fourths of the entire population should stop sense gratification and
simply be engaged in the advancement of Krsna consciousness. Only one
fourth of the population should be grhastha, and that should be accord-
ing to laws of restricted sense gratification. The grhasthas, vanaprasthas,
brahmacaris and sannyasis should endeavor together with their total en-
ergy to become Krsna conscious. This type of civilization is called daiva-
varnasrama. One of the objectives of the Krsna consciousness movement
is to establish this daiva-varnasrama, but not to encourage so-called
varnasrama without scientifically organized endeavor by human society.

divide; yatha—as much as (deserved); api—even; ekam—one;
atmanah—own; daram—the wife; nrnam—of the people in general;
svatva-grahah—the wife is accepted as being identical with one’s self;
yatah—because of which.

TRANSLATION

Dogs, fallen persons and untouchables, including candalas [dog-
eaters], should all be maintained with their proper necessities,
which should be contributed by the householders. Even one’s wife
at home, with whom one is most intimately attached, should be
offered for the reception of guests and people in general.

PURPORT

Although in modern society the dog is accepted as part of one’s house-
hold paraphernalia, in the Vedic system of household life the dog is un-
touchable; as mentioned here, a dog may be maintained with proper
food, but it cannot be allowed to enter one’s house, what to speak of the
bedroom. Outcastes or untouchable candalas should also be provided
with the necessities for life. The word used in this connection is yatha,
which means “as much as deserved.” The outcastes should not be given
money with which to indulge in more than they need, for otherwise they
will misuse it. At the present moment, for example, low-class men are
generally paid quite amply, but instead of using their money to cultivate
knowledge and advance in life, such low-class men use their extra money
for wine-drinking and similar sinful activities. As mentioned in
Bhagavad-gita (4.13), catur-varnyarn maya 37587 guna-karma-
vibhagasah: there must be four divisions of human society according to
the work and qualities of men. Men with the lowest qualities cannot do
any work that requires higher intelligence. However, although such a
division of men must exist according to their quality and work, it is sug-
gested herewith that everyone must have the necessities of life. The com-
munists of the present day are in favor of supplying the necessities of life
to everyone, but they consider only the human beings and not the lower
animals. The Bhagavatam’s principles are so broad, however, that it


--- Page 164 ---
Text 12] Ideal Family Life 159
recommends that the necessities of life be supplied to everyone, man or
animal, regardless of good or bad qualities.

The idea of giving even one’s wife to the service of the public is that
one’s intimate relationship with his wife, or one’s excessive attachment
for his wife, by which one thinks his wife to be his better half or to be
identical with himself, must gradually be given up. As formerly sug-
gested, the idea of ownership, even of one’s family, must be abandoned.
The dream of material life is the cause of bondage in the cycle of birth
and death, and therefore one should give up this dream. Consequently,
in the human form of life one’s attachment for his wife should be given
up, as suggested herein.

TRANSLATION

One so seriously considers one’s wife to be his own that he
sometimes kills himself for her or kills others, including even his
parents or his spiritual master or teacher. Therefore if one can
give up his attachment to such a wife, he conquers the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, who is never conquered by anyone.

PURPORT

Every husband is too much attached to his wife. Therefore, to give up

one’s connection with his wife is extremely difficult, but if one can


--- Page 165 ---
160 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 14
somehow or other give it up for the service of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, then the Lord Himself, although not able to be conquered by
anyone, comes very much under the control of the devotee. And if the
Lord is pleased with a devotee, what is there that is unobtainable? Why
should one not give up his affection for his wife and children and take
shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead? Where is the loss of any-
thing material? Householder life means attachment for one’s wife,
whereas sannyasa means detachment from one’s wife and attachment to
Krsna.

his wife’s body because that body will ultimately be transformed
into small insects, stool or ashes. What is the value of this insignifi-
cant body? How much greater is the Supreme Being, who is all-
pervading like the sky?

PURPORT

Here also, the same point is stressed: one should give up attachment

for his wife—or, in other words, for sex life. If one is intelligent, he can


--- Page 166 ---
Text 14] Ideal Family Life 161
think of his wife’s body as nothing but a lump of matter that will
ultimately be transformed into small insects, stool or ashes. In different
societies there are different ways of dealing with the human body at the
time of the funeral ceremony. In some societies the body is given to the
vultures to be eaten, and therefore the body ultimately turns to vulture
stool. Sometimes the body is merely abandoned, and in that case the body
is consumed by small insects. In some societies the body is immediately
burned after death, and thus it becomes ashes. In any case, if one intelli-
gently considers the constitution of the body and the soul beyond it, what
is the value of the body? Antavanta ime deha nityasyoktah saririnah:
the body may perish at any moment, but the soul is eternal. If one gives
up attachment for the body and increases his attachment for the spirit
soul, his life is successful. It is merely a matter of deliberation.

[food offered to the Lord] or with performing the five different

kinds of yajfia [pafica-siina]. By such activities, one can give up at-
tachment for the body and so-called proprietorship with reference
to the body. When one is able to do this, he is firmly fixed in the
position of a mahatma.
PURPORT

Nature already has an arrangement to feed us. By the order of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, there is an arrangement for eatables
for every living entity within the 8,400,000 forms of life. Eko bahiinam
yo vidadhati kaman. Every living entity has to eat something, and in fact
the necessities for his life have already been provided by the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. The Lord has provided food for both the
elephant and the ant. All living beings are living at the cost of the
Supreme Lord, and therefore one who is intelligent should not work very
hard for material comforts. Rather, one should save his energy for ad-
vancing in Krsna consciousness. All created things in the sky, in the air,
on land and in the sea belong to the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
and every living being is provided with food. Therefore one should not
be very much anxious about economic development and unnecessarily
waste time and energy with the risk of falling down in the cycle of birth
and death.

When one is enriched with wealth and knowledge which are
under his full control and by means of which he can perform yajiia
or please the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one must perform
sacrifices, offering oblations to the fire according to the directions
of the §astras. In this way one should worship the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead.
PURPORT
If a grhastha, or householder, is sufficiently educated in Vedic knowl-
edge and has become sufficiently rich to offer worship to please the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, he must perform yajiias as directed by


--- Page 169 ---
164 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 14
the authorized scriptures. Bhagavad-gita (3.9) clearly says, yajaarthat
karmano ’nyatra loko ‘yarn karma-bandhanah: everyone may be
engaged in his occupational duties, but the result of these duties should
be offered for sacrifice to satisfy the Supreme Lord. If one is fortunate
enough to possess transcendental knowledge as well as the money with
which to perform sacrifices, one must do it according to the directions
given in the sastras. It is said in Srimad-Bhdgavatam (12.3.52):
krte yad dhyayato visnum
tretayar yajato makhaih
dvapare paricaryayarm
kalau tad dhari-kirtanat
The entire Vedic civilization aims at satisfying the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. This was possible in Satya-yuga by meditation upon the
Supreme Lord within the core of one’s heart and in Treta-yuga by the
performance of costly 20705. The same goal could be achieved in
Dvapara-yuga by worship of the Lord in the temple, and in this age of
Kali one can achieve the same goal by performing sarkirtana-yajna.
Therefore one who has education and wealth must use them to satisfy the
Supreme Personality of Godhead by helping the sarikirtana movement
that has already begun —the Hare Krsna movement, or Krsna conscious-
ness movement. All educated and wealthy persons must join this move-
ment, since money and education are meant for service to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. If money and education are not engaged in the
service of the Lord, these valuable assets must be engaged in the service
of maya. The education of so-called scientists, philosophers and poets is
now engaged in the service of maya, and the wealth of the rich is also
engaged in maya’s service. The service of maya, however, creates a
chaotic condition in the world. Therefore the wealthy man and the edu-
cated man should sacrifice their knowledge and opulence by dedicating
them for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord and joining this sarikirtana
movement (yajiiaih sarikirtana-prayair yajanti hi sumedhasah).

TRANSLATION

The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Krsna, is the enjoyer
of sacrificial offerings. Yet although His Lordship eats the obla-
tions offered in the fire, my dear King, He is still more satisfied
when nice food made of grains and ghee is offered to Him through
the mouths of qualified brahmanas.

PURPORT

As stated in Bhagavad-gita (3.9), yajAdrthat karmano ’nyatra loko
’yariv karma-bandhanah: all fruitive activities should be performed for
sacrifice, which should be directed toward pleasing Krsna. As stated
elsewhere in Bhagavad-gita (5.29), bhoktarar yajiia-tapasam sarva-
loka-mahesvaram: He is the Supreme Lord and enjoyer of everything.
However, although sacrifice may be offered to please Krsna, He is more
pleased when grains and ghee, instead of being offered in the fire, are
prepared as prasdda and distributed, first to the brahmanas and then to
others. This system pleases Krsna more than anything else. Furthermore,
at the present time there is very little chance to offer sacrifices by pour-
ing oblations of food grains and ghee into the fire. Especially in India,
there is practically no ghee; for everything that should be done with
ghee, people use a certain type of oil preparation. Oil, however, is never
recommended for offering in a sacrificial fire. In Kali-yuga, the available
quantity of food grains and ghee is gradually diminishing, and people are
embarrassed that they cannot produce sufficient ghee and food grains.

166 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 14
Under the circumstances, the $astras enjoin, yajiaih sarnkirtana-prayair

one should join the sarikirtana movement, offering to the fire of this
movement the oblations of his knowledge and riches. In our sarikirtana
movement, or Hare Krsna movement, we offer sumptuous prasada to the
Deity and later distribute the same prasada to the brahmanas, the
Vaisnavas and then to the people in general. Krsna’s prasada is offered
to the brahmanas and Vaisnavas, and the prasada of the brahmanas and
Vaisnavas 15 offered to the general populace. This kind of sacrifice—
chanting of the Hare Krsna mantra and distribution of prasada—is the
most perfect and bona fide way of offering sacrifice for the pleasure of
Yajiia, or Visnu.

Text 19] Ideal Family Life 167
In this way you will be able to worship all living entities—or, in
other words, the supreme living entity within every living entity.
PURPORT

To distribute prasada to all living entities, the process is that we must
first offer prasada to the brahmanas and the Vaisnavas, for the demigods
are represented by the brahmanas. In this way the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, who is situated in everyone’s heart, will be worshiped. This
is the Vedic system of offering prasada. Whenever there is a ceremony
for distribution of prasada, the prasada is offered first to the
brahmanas, then to the children and old men, then to the women, and
then to animals like dogs and other domestic animals. When it is said that
Narayana, the Supreme Being, is situated in everyone’s heart, this does
not mean that everyone has become Narayana or that a particular poor
man has become Narayana. Such a conclusion is rejected herein.

One should perform the $raddha ceremony on the Makara-
sankranti [the day when the sun begins to move north] or on the
Karkata-sankranti [the day when the sun begins to move south].
One should also perform this ceremony on the Mesa-sankranti day
and the Tula-sankranti day, in the yoga named Vyatipata, on that
day in which three lunar tithis are conjoined, during an eclipse of
either the moon or the sun, on the twelfth lunar day, and in the
Sravana-naksatra. One should perform this ceremony on the
Aksaya-trtiya day, on the ninth lunar day of the bright fortnight of

the month of Kartika, on the four astakas in the winter season and
cool season, on the seventh lunar day of the bright fortnight of the
month of Magha, during the conjunction of Magha-naksatra and
the full-moon day, and on the days when the moon is completely
full, or not quite completely full, when these days are conjoined
with the naksatras from which the names of certain months are
derived. One should also perform the $raddha ceremony on the
twelfth lunar day when it is in conjunction with any of the
naksatras named Anuradha, Sravana, Uttara-phalguni, Uttarasadha
or Uttara-bhadrapada. Again, one should perform this ceremony
when the eleventh lunar day is in conjunction with either Uttara-
phalguni, Uttarasadha or Uttara-bhadrapada. Finally, one should
perform this ceremony on days conjoined with one’s own birth
star [janma-naksatra] or with Sravana-naksatra.
PURPORT

The word ayana means “path” or “going.” The six months when the
sun moves toward the north are called uttarayana, or the northern path,
and the six months when it moves south are called daksinayana, or the
southern path. These are mentioned in Bhagavad-gita (8.24-25). The
first day when the sun begins to move north and enter the zodiacal sign
of Capricorn is called Makara-sankranti, and the first day when the sun
begins to move south and enter the sign of Cancer is called Karkata-
sankranti. On these two days of the year, one should perform the
sraddha ceremony.

Visuva, or Visuva-sankranti, means Mesa-sankranti, or the day on
which the sun enters the sign Aries. Tula-sankranti is the day on which
the sun enters the sign Libra. Both of these days occur only once within a
year. The word yoga refers to a certain relationship between the sun and
moon as they move in the sky. There are twenty-seven different degrees
of yoga, of which the seventeenth is called Vyatipata. On the day when
this occurs, one should perform the sraddha ceremony. A tithi, or lunar
day, consists of the distance between the longitude of the sun and that of
the moon. Sometimes a tithi is less than twenty-four hours. When it
starts after sunrise on a certain day and ends before the sunrise of the
following day, the previous tithi and the following tithi both ‘“‘touch’ the

Text 24] Ideal Family Life 171
twenty-four-hour day between the sunrises. This is called tryaha-sparsa,
or a day touched by some portion of three tithis.

Srila Jiva Gosvami has given quotations from many Sastras stating that
the Sraddha ceremony of oblations to the forefathers should not be per-
formed on Ekadasi tithi. When the tithi of the death anniversary falls on
the Ekadasi day, the sraddha ceremony should be held not on Ekadasi
but on the next day, or dvadasi. In the Brahma-vaivarta Purana it is
said:

ye kurvanti mahipala
sraddham caikadasi-dine
trayas te narakam yanti
data bhokta ca prerakah
If one performs the sraddha ceremony of oblations to the forefathers on
the Ekadasi tithi, then the performer, the forefathers for whom the
sraddha is observed, and the purohita, or the family priest who en-
courages the ceremony, all go to hell.

and if one practices devotional service to the Lord, he goes back home,
back to Godhead. In the human form of life, therefore, one is meant to
act auspiciously in order to return home, back to Godhead. Devotional
service, however, does not depend on material conditions. Ahaituky

the material platform, the times and seasons mentioned above are ex-

the directions of the sastra. Bhagavad-gita strongly recommends, jiatva
Sastra-vidhanoktam: everything must be performed as indicated in the
Sastras. For Kali-yuga, the $astras enjoin that sarikirtana-yajiia be per-
formed always: kirtaniyah sada harih. All the ritualistic ceremonies
recommended in the $astras must be preceded and followed by
sarikirtana. This is the recommendation of Srila Jiva Gosvami.

TRANSLATION
Narada Muni continued: Now I shall describe the places where
religious performances may be well executed. Any place where a
Vaisnava is available is an excellent place for all auspicious ac-
tivities. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the support of this
entire cosmic manifestation, with all its moving and nonmoving
living entities, and the temple where the Deity of the Lord is in-
stalled is a most sacred place. Furthermore, places where learned
brahmanas observe Vedic principles by means of austerity, educa-
tion and mercy are also most auspicious and sacred.
PURPORT
In this verse it is indicated that a Vaisnava temple where the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Krsna, is worshiped, and where Vaisnavas are
engaged in the service of the Lord, is the best sacred place for perform-
ing any religious ceremonies. At the present day, especially in big, big
cities, people live in small apartments and are not able to establish a
Deity or temple. Under the circumstances, therefore, the centers and
temples being established by the expanding Krsna consciousness move-
ment are the best sacred places for performing religious ceremonies. Al-
though people in general are no longer interested in religious ceremonies
or Deity worship, the Krsna consciousness movement gives everyone the
chance to advance in spiritual life by becoming Krsna conscious.

TRANSLATION

Auspicious indeed are the places where there is a temple of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, in which He is duly
worshiped, and also the places where there flow the celebrated
sacred rivers mentioned in the Puranas, the supplementary Vedic
literatures. Anything spiritual done there is certainly very effec-
tive.

PURPORT

There are many atheists who oppose the worship of the Deity of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead in the temple. In this verse, however, it
is authoritatively stated that any place where the Deity is worshiped is
transcendental; it does not belong to the material world. It is also said
that the forest is in the mode of goodness, and therefore those who want
to cultivate spiritual life are advised to go to the forest (vanam gato yad
dharim asrayeta). But one should not go to the forest simply to live like a
monkey. Monkeys and other ferocious animals also live in the forest, but
a person who goes to the forest for spiritual culture must accept the lotus
feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead as shelter (vanam gato yad
dharim asrayeta). One should not be satisfied simply to go to the forest;
one must take shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. In this age, therefore, since it is impossible to go to the forest
for spiritual culture, one is recommended to live in the temple com-
munity as a devotee, regularly worship the Deity, follow the regulative
principles and thus make the place like Vaikuntha. The forest may be in
goodness, the cities and villages in passion, and the brothels, hotels and
restaurants in ignorance, but when one lives in the temple community he
lives in Vaikuntha. Therefore it is said here, sreyasarm padam: it is the
best, most auspicious place.

In many places throughout the world we are constructing communities
to give shelter to devotees and worship the Deity in the temple. The
Deity cannot be worshiped except by devotees. Temple worshipers who


--- Page 182 ---
Text 33] Ideal Family Life 177
fail to give importance to the devotees are third class. They are kanistha-
adhikaris in the lower stage of spiritual life. As it is said in Srimad-
Bhagavatam (11.2.47);
arcayam eva haraye
pijam yah sraddhayehate
na tad-bhaktesu canyesu
sa bhaktah prakrtah smrtah
“A person who is very faithfully engaged in the worship of the Deity in
the temple but does not know how to behave toward devotees or people in
general is called a prakrta-bhakta, or kanistha-adhikari.”” Therefore, in
the temple there must be the Deity of the Lord, and the Lord should be
worshiped by the devotees. This combination of the devotees and the
Deity creates a first-class transcendental place.

Aside from this, if a grhastha devotee worships the salagrama-sila, or
the form of the Deity at home, his home also becomes a very great place.
It was therefore customary for members of the three higher classes—
namely the brahmanas, ksatriyas and wvaiSyas—to worship the
Salagrama-sila, or a small Deity of Radha-Krsna or Sita-Rama in each
and every home. This made everything auspicious. But now they have
given up the Deity worship. Men have become modernized and are con-
sequently indulging in all sorts of sinful activities, and therefore they are
extremely unhappy.

According to Vedic civilization, therefore, the holy places of
pilgrimage are considered most sacred, and still there are hundreds and
thousands of holy places like Jagannatha Puri, Vrndavana, Hardwar,
Ramesvara, Prayaga and Mathura. India is the place for worshiping or
for cultivating spiritual life. The Krsna consciousness movement invites
everyone from all over the world, without discrimination as to caste or
creed, to come to its centers and cultivate spiritual life perfectly.

Varanasi, Mathura, Pampa, Bindu-sarovara, Badarikasrama
[NarayanaSrama], the places where the Nanda River flows, the
places where Lord Ramacandra and mother Sita took shelter, such
as Citrakiita, and also the hilly tracts of land known as Mahendra
and Malaya—all of these are to be considered most pious and
sacred. Similarly, places outside India where there are centers of
the Krsna consciousness movement and where Radha-Krsna


--- Page 185 ---
180 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 14
Deities are worshiped must all be visited and worshiped by those
who want to be spiritually advanced. One who intends to advance
in spiritual life may visit all these places and perform ritualistic
ceremonies to get results a thousand times better than the results
of the same activities performed in any other place.
PURPORT

In these verses and in verse twenty-nine, stress is given to one point:
harer arcasritas ca ye or harer arca. In other words, any place where the
Deity of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshiped by devotees is
most significant. The Krsna consciousness movement is giving the
population of the entire world a chance to take advantage of Krsna con-
sciousness through the ISKCON centers, where one may perform Deity
worship and chant the Hare Krsna mahad-mantra and in this way obtain
results with effectiveness increased a thousand times. This constitutes
the best welfare activity for human society. This was Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu’s mission as it was predicted by Him in the Caitanya-
bhagavata (Antya 4.126):

prthivite ache yata nagaradi-grama
sarvatra pracdara haibe mora nama
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu wanted the Hare Krsna movement, with in-
stalled Deities, to spread to every village and town in the world, so that
everyone in the world might take advantage of this movement and be-
come all-auspicious in spiritual life. Without spiritual life, nothing is
auspicious. Moghasa  mogha-karmano mogha-jiana  vicetasah
(Bg. 9.12). No one can become successful in fruitive activities or specu-
lative knowledge without being Krsna conscious. As recommended in the
Sastras, everyone should be very eagerly interested in taking part in the
Krsna consciousness movement and understanding the value of spiritual
life.

PURPORT
Whenever we perform some religious act in terms of dharma, artha,
kama and moksa, we must perform it according to the time, place and
person (kala, desa, patra). Narada Muni has already described the desa
(place) and kala (time). The kala has been described in verses twenty
through twenty-four, beginning with the words ayane visuve kuryad
vyatipate dina-ksaye. And the places for giving charity or performing
ritualistic ceremonies have been described in verses thirty through
thirty-three, beginning with sararmsi puskaradini ksetrany arhasritany
uta. Now, to whom everything must be given is decided in this verse.
Harir evaika urvisa yan-mayariv vai caracaram. The Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead, Krsna, is the root of everything, and therefore He is
the best patra, or person, to whom everything must be given. In
Bhagavad-gita (5.29) it is said:
bhoktaram yajiia-tapasari
sarva-loka-mahesvaram


--- Page 187 ---
182 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 14
suhrdari sarva-bhitanam
JAatva mar santim rcchati
If one wants to enjoy real peace and prosperity, he should give every-
thing to Krsna, who is the real enjoyer, real friend and real proprietor. It
is therefore said:
yatha taror miila-nisecanena
trpyanti tat-skandha-bhujopasakhah
pranopahdrac ca yathendriyanam
tathaiva sarvarhanam acyutejya
(Bhag. 4.31.14)
By worshiping or satisfying Acyuta, the Supreme Personality of God-
head, Krsna, one can satisfy everyone, just as one can water the
branches, leaves and flowers of a tree simply by watering its root or as
one satisfies all the senses of the body by giving food to the stomach.
Therefore, a devotee simply offers everything to the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead to receive the best results of charity, religious per-
formances, sense gratification and even liberation (dharma, artha,
kama, moksa).

O King Yudhisthira, the demigods, many great sages and saints
including even the four sons of Lord Brahma, and I myself were
present at your Rajasiiya sacrificial ceremony, but when there was
a question of who should be the first person worshiped, everyone
decided upon Lord Krsna, the Supreme Person.

PURPORT

This is a reference to the Rajasiiya sacrifice performed by Maharaja
Yudhisthira. In that meeting there was a great turmoil over selecting the
best person to be worshiped first. Everyone decided to worship Sri Krsna.
The only protest came from SiSupila, and because of his vehement op-
position he was killed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

[Krsna]. Therefore simply by worshiping Lord Krsna one can wor-
ship all living entities.
PURPORT
In Bhagavad-gita (10.8) the Lord says:
ahari sarvasya prabhavo
mattah sarvam pravartate
iti matva bhajante mam
budha bhava-samanvitah

“I am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything ema-
nates from Me. The wise who perfectly know this engage in My devo-
tional service and worship Me with all their hearts.” People are very
much anxious to give service to other living entities, especially to the
poor, but although they have manufactured many ways to give such
help, actually they are expert in killing the poor living entities. This sort
of service or mercy is not recommended in the Vedic wisdom. As stated
in a previous verse, it has been decided (niruktam) by expert saintly per-
sons that Krsna is the root of everything and that worshiping Krsna is
worshiping everyone, just as supplying water to the root of a tree means
satisfying all of its branches and twigs.

Another point is that this universe is full of living entities from top to
bottom, on every planet (jiva-rasibhir gkirnah). Modern scientists and
so-called scholars think that there are no living entities on planets other
than this one. Recently they have said that they have gone to the moon
but did not find any living entities there. But Srimad-Bhagavatam and
the other Vedic literatures do not agree with this foolish conception.
There are living entities everywhere, not only one or two but jiva-
rasibhih —many millions of living entities. Even on the sun there are liv-
ing entities, although it is a firey planet. The chief living entity on the
sun is called Vivasvan (imam vivasvate 20807 proktavan aham
avyayam). All the different planets are filled with different types of liv-
ing entities according to different living conditions. To suggest that only
this planet is filled with living entities and that others are vacant is
foolish. This betrays a lack of real knowledge.

the purusavatira.
PURPORT
In Bhagavad-gita (18.61) it is said:

“The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone’s heart, O Arjuna, and is
directing the wanderings of all living entities, who are seated as on a
machine, made of the material energy.” The living entity, who is part
and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, exists on the mercy of


--- Page 191 ---
186 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 14
the Lord, who is always with him in any form of body. The living entity
desires a particular type of material enjoyment, and thus the Lord sup-
plies him with a body, which is like a machine. Just to keep him alive in
that body, the Lord remains with him as the purusa (Ksirodakasayi
Visnu). This is also confirmed in Brahma-sarhita (5.35):

“I worship the Personality of Godhead, Govinda, who enters the exis-
tence of every universe and every atom by one of His plenary portions
and thus manifests His infinite energy throughout the material cre-
ation.” The living entity, being part and parcel of the Lord, is known as
jiva. The Supreme Lord purusa remains with the jiva to enable him to
enjoy material facilities.

standing. Therefore the Supersoul is the chief within the body.
The Supersoul is manifested to the individual soul according to
the individual’s comparative development of knowledge, austerity,
penance and so on.
PURPORT
In Bhagavad-gita (15.15) it is said, mattah smrtir jiagnam apohanam
ca: the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His localized aspect gives in-
telligence to the individual soul as far as he is able to grasp it. Therefore
we find the individual soul in different high and low positions. A living
entity with the body of a bird or beast cannot take instructions from the
Supreme Soul as adequately as an advanced human being. Thus there are
gradations of bodily forms. In human society, the perfect brahmana is
supposed to be the most advanced in spiritual consciousness, and further
advanced than the brahmana is the Vaisnava. Therefore the best persons
are the Vaisnavas and Visnu. When charity is to be given, one should
take instruction from Bhagavad-gita (17.20):
datavyam iti yad 02707
diyate ’nupakarine
dese kale ca patre ca
tad danari sattvikarn smrtam
“That gift which is given out of duty, at the proper time and place, to a
worthy person, and without expectation of return, is considered to be
charity in the mode of goodness.” One should give charity to the
brahmanas and Vaisnavas, for thus the Supreme Personality of Godhead
will be worshiped. In this connection, Srila Madhvacarya comments:
brahmadi-sthavarantesu
na viseso hareh kvacit
vyakti-matra-visesena
taratamyarih vadanti ca
Beginning from Brahma down to the ant, everyone is conducted by the
Supersoul (कष्य, sarva-bhitanam hrd-dese ’rjuna tisthati). But be-
cause of a particular person’s advancement in spiritual consciousness, he


--- Page 193 ---
188 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 14
is considered to be important. Therefore, the brahmana Vaisnava 15 im-
portant, and, above all, the Supersoul, the Personality of Godhead, is the
most important personality.

My dear King, when great sages and saintly persons saw
mutually disrespectful dealings at the beginning of Treta-yuga,
Deity worship in the temple was introduced with all paraphernalia.
PURPORT
As it is said in Srimad-Bhagavatam (12.3.52):
krte yad dhyayato visnum
tretayar yajato makhaih
dvapare paricaryayar
kalau tad dhari-kirtanat
“Whatever result one obtained in Satya-yuga by meditating on Visnu, in
Treta-yuga by performing sacrifices and in Dvapara-yuga by serving the


--- Page 194 ---
Text 39] Ideal Family Life 189
Lord’s lotus feet one can also obtain in Kali-yuga simply by chanting the
Hare Krsna maha-mantra.” In Satya-yuga, every person was spiritually
advanced, and there was no envy between great personalities. Gradually,
however, because of material contamination with the advance of the
ages, disrespectful dealings appeared even among brahmanas and
Vaisnavas. Actually, an advanced Vaisnava is to be respected more than
Visnu. As stated in the Padma Purana, aradhananarh sarvesam visnor
aradhanarin param: of all kinds of worship, worship of Lord Visnu is the
best. Tasmat paratararii devi tadiyanam samarcanam: and recom-
mended more than worship of Visnu is worship of the Vaisnava.

Formerly, all activities were performed in connection with Visnu, but
after Satya-yuga there were symptoms of disrespectful dealings among
Vaispavas. Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura has said that a Vaisnava is he
who has helped others become Vaisnavas. An example of one who has
converted many others into Vaisnavas is Narada Muni. A powerful
Vaisnava who has converted others into Vaisnavas is to be worshiped,
but because of material contamination, sometimes such an exalted
Vaisnava is disrespected by other, minor Vaisnavas. When great saintly
persons saw this contamination, they introduced worship of the Deity in
the temple. This began in Tretd-yuga and was especially prominent in
Dvipara-yuga (dvapare paricaryayar). But in Kali-yuga, worship of the
Deity is being neglected. Therefore chanting of the Hare Krsna mantra is
more powerful than Deity worship. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu set a prac-
tical example in that He did not establish any temples or Deities, but He
profusely introduced the sarikirtana movement. Therefore Krsna con-
sciousness preachers should give more stress to the sarnkirtana move-
ment, especially by distributing transcendental literature more and
more. This helps the sarikirtana movement. Whenever there is a
possibility to worship the Deity, we may establish many centers, but
generally we should give more stress to the distribution of transcendental
literature, for this will be more effective in converting people to Krsna
consciousness.

It is said in Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.2.47):

arcayam eva haraye
puja yah sraddhayehate


--- Page 195 ---
190 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 14
na tad-bhaktesu canyesu

sa bhaktah prakrtah smrtah
“A person who is very faithfully engaged in the worship of the Deity in
the temple but does not know how to behave toward devotees or people in
general is called a prakrta-bhakta, or kanistha-adhikari.”” A prakrta de-
votee, or neophyte devotee, is still on the material platform. He certainly
engages in worshiping the Deity, but he cannot appreciate the activities
of a pure devotee. It has actually been seen that even an authorized devo-
tee who is engaged in the service of the Lord by preaching the mission of
Krsna consciousness is sometimes criticized by neophyte devotees. Such
neophytes are described by Viévanatha Cakravarti Thakura: sarva-
prani-sammanandasamarthanam avajiia spardhadimatarm tu bhagavat-
pratimaiva patram ity aha. For those who cannot properly appreciate the
activities of authorized devotees, Deity worship is the only way for spiri-
tual advancement. In the Caitanya-caritamrta (Antya 7.11) it is clearly
said, krsna-sakti vind nahe tara pravartana: without being authorized by
Krsna, one cannot preach the holy name of the Lord throughout the en-
tire world. Nevertheless, a devotee who does so is criticized by neophyte
devotees, kanistha-adhikaris , who are on the lower stages of devotional
service. For them, Deity worship is strongly recommended.

TRANSLATION
Sometimes a neophyte devotee offers all the paraphernalia for
worshiping the Lord, and he factually worships the Lord as the
Deity, but because he is envious of the authorized devotees of Lord
Visnu, the Lord is never satisfied with his devotional service.
PURPORT
Deity worship is especially meant for purifying the neophyte devotees.
Actually, however, preaching is more important. In Bhagaved-gita
(18.69) it is said, na ca tasman manusyesu kascin me priya-krttamah: if
one wants to be recognized by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he
must preach the glories of the Lord. One who worships the Deity must
therefore be extremely respectful to preachers; otherwise simply
worshiping the Deity will keep one in the lower stage of devotion.

TRANSLATION
My dear King, of all persons a qualified brahmana must be ac-
cepted as the best within this material world because such a
brahmana, by practicing austerity, Vedic studies and satisfaction,
becomes the counterpart body of the Supreme Personality of God-
head.
PURPORT
From the Vedas we learn that the Personality of Godhead is the
Supreme Person. Every living entity is an individual person, and the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, is the Supreme Person. A
brahmana who is well versed in Vedic knowledge and fully conversant
with transcendental matters becomes a representative of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, and therefore one should worship such a
brahmana or Vaisnava. A Vaisnava is superior to a brahmana because
whereas a brahmana knows that he is Brahman, not matter, a Vaisnava
knows that he is not only Brahman but also an eternal servant of the
Supreme Brahman. Therefore, worship of a Vaisnava is superior to wor-
ship of the Deity in the temple. Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says,
saksad dharitvena samasta-sastraih: in all the scriptures the spiritual
master, who is the best of the brahmanas, the best of the Vaisnavas, is
considered to be as good as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This
does not mean, however, that the Vaisnava thinks himself God, for this is
` blasphemous. Although a brahmana or Vaisnava is worshiped as being as
good as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, such a devotee always
remains a faithful servant of the Lord and never tries to enjoy the
prestige that might accrue to him from being the Supreme Lord’s repre-
sentative.

TRANSLATION

My dear King Yudhisthira, the brahmanas, especially those
engaged in preaching the glories of the Lord throughout the en-
tire world, are recognized and worshiped by the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead, who is the heart and soul of all creation. The
brahmanas, by their preaching, sanctify the three worlds with the
dust of their lotus feet, and thus they are worshipable even for
Krsna.

PURPORT

As admitted by Lord Krsna in Bhagavad-gita (18.69), na ca tasman
manusyesu kascin me priya-krttamah. The brahmanas preach the cult of
Krsna consciousness all around the world, and therefore, although they
worship Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Lord also rec-
ognizes them as worshipable. The relationship is reciprocal. The
brahmanas want to worship Krsna, and similarly Krsna wants to worship
the brahmanas. In conclusion, therefore, brahmanas and Vaisnavas who
are engaged in preaching the glories of the Lord must be worshiped by
religionists, philosophers and people in general. At the Rajasiiya-yajia of
Maharaja Yudhisthira, many hundreds and thousands of brahmanas
were present, yet Krsna was selected to be worshiped first. Therefore,
Krsna is always the Supreme Person, but by His causeless mercy He rec-
ognizes the brahmanas as dearmost to Him.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Seventh Canto, Fourteenth
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “Ideal Family Life.”


--- Page 199 ---
CHAPTER FIFTEEN
Instructions for
Civilized Human Beings

The summary of the Fifteenth Chapter is as follows. In the previous
chapter, Sri Narada Muni proved the importance of the brahmana in
society. Now, in this chapter, he will show the differences between dif-
ferent grades of brahmanas. Among the brahmanas, some are house-
holders and are mostly attached to fruitive activities or the betterment of
social conditions. Above them, however, are brahmanas who are very
much attracted by austerities and penances and who retire from family
life. They are known as vanaprasthas. Other brahmanas are very much
interested in studying the Vedas and explaining the purport of the Vedas
to others. Such brahmanas are called brahmacaris. And still other
brahmanas are interested in different types of yoga, especially bhakti-
yoga and jAdna-yoga. Such brahmanas are mostly sannydsis, members
of the renounced order of life.

As far as householders are concerned, they engage in different types of
scriptural activities, especially in offering oblations to their forefathers
and giving as charity to other brahmanas the paraphernalia engaged in
such sacrifices. Generally the charity is given to sannydsis, brahmanas in
the renounced order of life. If such a sannyasi is not available, the
charity is given to brahmana householders engaged in fruitive activities.

One should not make very elaborate arrangements to perform the
sraddha ceremony of offering oblations to one’s forefathers. The best
process for the sraddha ceremony is to distribute bhagavata-prasada
(remnants of food that has first been offered to Krsna) to all of one’s
forefathers and relatives. This makes a first-class sraddha ceremony. In
the Sraddha ceremony there is no need to offer meat or eat meat. Unnec-
essary killing of animals must be avoided. Those who are in the lower
grades of society prefer to perform sacrifices by killing animals, but one
who is advanced in knowledge must avoid such unnecessary violence.

Brahmanas should execute their regulative duties in worshiping Lord
Visnu. Those who are advanced in knowledge of religious principles

195


--- Page 200 ---
196 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 15
must avoid five kinds of irreligion, known as vidharma, para-dharma,
dharmabhasa, upadharma and chala-dharma. One must act according
to the religious principles that suit his constitutional position; it is not
that everyone must adhere to the same type of religion. A general prin-
ciple is that a poor man should not unnecessarily endeavor for economic
development. One who refrains from such endeavors but who engages in
devotional service is most auspicious.

One who is not satisfied with the mind must fall to degradation. One
must conquer lusty desires, anger, greed, fear, lamentation, illusion,
fright, unnecessary talks on material subjects, violence, the four miseries
of material existence, and the three material qualities. That is the objec-
tive of human life. One who has no faith in the spiritual master, who is
identical with Sri Krsna, cannot get any benefit from reading sastra. One
should never consider the spiritual master an ordinary human being,
even though the members of the spiritual master’s family may think of
him as such. Meditation and other processes of austerity are useful only
if they help in advancement toward Krsna consciousness; otherwise,
they are simply a waste of time and labor. For those who are not devo-
tees, such meditation and austerity cause falldown.

Every householder should be very careful because even though a
householder may try to conquer the senses, he becomes a victim to the
association of relatives and falls down. Thus a grhastha must become a
vanaprastha or sannyasi, live in a secluded place, and be satisfied with
food gotten by begging from door to door. He must chant the omkara
mantra or Hare Krsna mantra, and in this way he will perceive transcen-
dental bliss within himself. After taking sannyasa, however, if one
returns to grhastha life, he is called a vantasi, which means “one who
eats his own vomit.” Such a person is shameless. A householder should
not give up the ritualistic ceremonies, and a sannyasi should not live in
society. If a sannyast is agitated by the senses, he is a cheater influenced
by the modes of passion and ignorance. When one assumes a role in
goodness by starting philanthropic and altruistic activities, such activities
become impediments on the path of devotional service.

The best process for advancing in devotional service is to abide by the
orders of the spiritual master, for only by his direction can one conquer
the senses. Unless one is completely Krsna conscious, there is a chance of
falling down. Of course, in performing ritualistic ceremonies and other
fruitive activities there are also many dangers at every moment. Fruitive


--- Page 201 ---
Text 1] Instructions for Civilized Human Beings 197
activities have been divided into twelve portions. Because of performing
fruitive activities, which are called the path of dharma, one has to accept
the cycle of birth and death, but when one takes the path of moksa, or
liberation, which is described in Bhagavad-gita as arcana-marga, one
can get relief from the cycle of birth and death. The Vedas describe these
two paths as pitr-yana and deva-yana. Those who follow the paths of
pitr-yana and deva-yana are never bewildered, even while in the ma-
terial body. A monistic philosopher who gradually develops control of the
senses understands that the objective of all the different asramas, the
statuses of life, is salvation. One must live and act according to Sastras.

If one who is performing the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies becomes a
devotee, even if he is a grhastha, he can receive the causeless mercy of
Krsna. The objective of a devotee is to return home, back to Godhead.
Such a devotee, even though not performing ritualistic ceremonies, ad-
vances in spiritual consciousness by the supreme will of the Personality
of Godhead. One may actually become successful in spiritual conscious-
ness by the mercy of devotees, or one may fall from spiritual conscious-
ness by being disrespectful to devotees. In this regard, Narada Muni
narrated the history of how he had fallen from the Gandharva kingdom,
how he was born in a Sidra family, and how by serving exalted
brahmanas he become the son of Lord Brahma and was reinstated in his
transcendental position. After narrating all these stories, Narada Muni
praised the mercy received from the Lord by the Pandavas. Maharaja
Yudhisthira, after hearing from Narada, become ecstatic in love of
Krsna, and then Narada Muni left that place and returned to his own
place. Thus Sukadeva Gosvami, having described various descendants of
the daughters of Daksa, ends the Seventh Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam.

whereas some, although very few, cultivate knowledge and prac-

TRANSLATION

A person desiring liberation for his forefathers or himself
should give charity to a brahmana who adheres to impersonal
monism [jiiana-nistha]. In the absence of such an advanced
brahmana, charity may be given to a brahmana addicted to fruitive
activities [karma-kanda].

PURPORT

There are two processes by which to get free from material bondage.
One involves jiana-kanda and karma-kanda, and the other involves
upasana-kanda. Vaisnavas never want to merge into the existence of the
Supreme; rather, they want to be everlastingly servants of the Lord to
render loving service unto Him. In this verse the words anantyam
icchata refer to persons who desire to achieve liberation from material
bondage and merge into the existence of the Lord. Devotees, however,
whose objective is to associate personally with the Lord, have no desire
to accept the activities of karma-kanda or jiana-kanda, for pure
devotional service is above both karma-kanda and jRana-kanda.
Anyabhilasita-sinyarn jiana-karmady-anavrtam. In pure devotional
service there is not even a pinch of jiigna or karma. Consequently, when
Vaisnavas distribute charity, they do not need to find a brahmana per-
forming the activities of jiiana-kanda or karma-kanda. The best exam-
ple in this regard is provided by Advaita Gosvami, who, after performing
the sraddha ceremony for his father, offered charity to Haridasa
Thakura, although it was known to everyone that Haridasa Thakura was
born in a Mohammedan family, not a brahmana family, and was not in-
terested in the activities of jiana-kanda or karma-kanda.

Charity, therefore, should be given to the first-class transcendentalist,
the devotee, because the sdstras recommend:

muktanam api siddhanari
narayana-parayanah
sudurlabhah prasantatma
kotisv api maha-mune

“O great sage, among many millions who are liberated and perfect in
knowledge of liberation, one may be a devotee of Lord Narayana, or


--- Page 204 ---
200 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 15
Krsna. Such devotees, who are fully peaceful, are extremely rare.”
(Bhag. 6.14.5) A Vaisnpava is in a higher position than a jiani, and
therefore Advaita Acarya selected Haridasa Thakura to be the person to
accept His charity. The Supreme Lord also says:
na me ‘bhaktas catur-vedt
mad-bhaktah Sva-pacah priyah
tasmai deyar tato grahyam
sa ca (च्छ) yatha hy aham
“Even though a person is a very learned scholar of the Sanskrit Vedic
literatures, he is not accepted as My devotee unless he is pure in devo-
tional service. However, even though a person is born in a family of dog-
eaters, he is very dear to Me if he is a pure devotee who has no motive to
enjoy fruitive activity or mental speculation. Indeed, all respect should
be given to him, and whatever he offers should be accepted. Such
devotees are as worshipable as 1 am.” (Hari-bhakti-vilasa 10.127)
Therefore, even if not born in a brahmana family, a devotee, because of
his devotion to the Lord, is above all kinds of brahmanas, whether they
be karma-kandis or jiana-kandis.

In this regard, it may be mentioned that brahmanas in Vrndavana
who are karma-kandis and jRana-kandis sometimes decline to accept in-
vitations to our temple because our temple is known as the angareji tem-
ple, or “Anglican temple.” But in accordance with the evidence given in
the sastra and the example set by Advaita Acirya, we give prasada to de-
votees regardless of whether they come from India, Europe or America.
It is the conclusion of the $astra that instead of feeding many jiana-
kandi or karma-kandi brahmanas, it is better to feed a pure Vaisnava,
regardless of where he comes from. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-
gita (9.30):

api cet suduracaro
bhajate mam ananya-bhak
sadhur eva sa mantavyah
samyag vyavasito hi sah
“Even if one commits the most abominable actions, if he is engaged in
devotional service he is to be considered saintly because he is properly


--- Page 205 ---
Text 3] Instructions for Civilized Human Beings 201
situated.” Thus it doesn’t matter whether a devotee comes from a
brahmana family or non-brahmana family; if he is fully devoted to
Krsna, he is a sadhu.

are offered to the forefathers; trin—three; eka—one; ekam—one;
ubhayatra—for both occasions; va—either; bhojayet—one should feed;
su-samrddhah api—even though one is very rich; sraddhe —when offer-

TRANSLATION
During the period for offering oblations to the demigods, one
should invite only two brahmanas, and while offering oblations to
the forefathers, one may invite three brahmanas. Or, in either
case, only one brahmana will suffice. Even though one is very opu-
lent, he should not endeavor to invite more brahmanas or make
various expensive arrangements on those occasions.
PURPORT
As we have already mentioned, Srila Advaita Acarya, during the
generally observed ceremony to offer oblations to the forefathers, invited
only Haridasa Thakura. Thus He followed this principle: na me ’bhaktas
catur-vedi mad-bhaktah Sva-pacah priyah. The Lord says, “It is not
necessary that one become very expert in Vedic knowledge before he can
become My bhakta, or devotee. Even if one is born in a family of dog-
eaters, he can become My devotee and be very dear to Me, in spite of


--- Page 206 ---
202 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 15
having taken birth in such a family. Therefore, offerings should be given
to My devotee, and whatever My devotee has offered Me should be ac-
cepted.” Following this principle, one should invite a first-class
brahmana or Vaisnava—a realized soul —and feed him while observing
the sraddha ceremony to offer oblations to one’s forefathers.

TRANSLATION

If one arranges to feed many brahmanas or relatives during the
sraddha ceremony, there will be discrepancies in the time, place,
respectability and ingredients, the person to be worshiped, and the
method of offering worship.

PURPORT

Narada Muni has prohibited unnecessarily gorgeous arrangements to
feed relatives or brahmanas during the sraddha ceremony. Those who
are materially opulent spend lavishly during this ceremony. Indians
spend especially lavishly on three occasions—at the birth of a child, at
marriage and while observing the sraddha ceremony —but the $astras
prohibit the excessive expenditures involved in inviting many
brahmanas and relatives, especially during the sraddha ceremony.

TRANSLATION

One should offer prasada to the demigods, the saintly persons,
one’s forefathers, the people in general, one’s family members,
one’s relatives and one’s friends, seeing them all as devotees of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead.

PURPORT

As mentioned above, it is recommended that everyone distribute
prasada, considering every living being a part and parcel of the Supreme
Lord. Even in feeding the poor, one should distribute prasada. In Kali-
yuga there is a scarcity of food almost every year, and thus
philanthropists spend lavishly to feed the poor. For this they invent the
term daridra-narayana-sevd. This is prohibited. One should distribute
sumptuous prasada, considering everyone a part of the Supreme Lord,
but one should not juggle words to make a poor man Narayana. Everyone
is related to the Supreme Lord, but one should not mistakenly think that
because one is related to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he has be-
come the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana. Such a Mayavada
philosophy is extremely dangerous, especially for a devotee. Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu has therefore strictly forbidden us to associate with
Mayavadi philosophers. Mayavadi-bhasya Sunile haya sarva-nasa: if
one associates with the Mayavada philosophy, his devotional life is
doomed.

A person fully aware of religious principles should never offer
anything like meat, eggs or fish in the sraddha ceremony, and even
if one is a ksatriya, he himself should not eat such things. When
suitable food prepared with ghee is offered to saintly persons, the
function is pleasing to the forefathers and the Supreme Lord, who
are never pleased when animals are killed in the name of sacrifice.

religious principles and who are free from material desires, con-
trol the self in the fire of spiritual knowledge, or knowledge of the
Absolute Truth. They may give up the process of ritualistic
ceremonies.
PURPORT
People are generally very much interested in karma-kanda ritualistic
ceremonies for elevation to the higher planetary systems, but when one
awakens his spiritual knowledge, he becomes uninterested in such eleva-
tion and engages himself fully in jAiana-yajiia to find the objective of
life. The objective of life is to stop completely the miseries of birth and
death and to return home, back to Godhead. When one cultivates knowl-
edge for this purpose, he is considered to be on a higher platform than
one who is engaged in karma-yajna, or fruitive activities.

TRANSLATION

Upon seeing the person engaged in performing the sacrifice,
animals meant to be sacrificed are extremely afraid, thinking,
“This merciless performer of sacrifices, being ignorant of the pur-
pose of sacrifice and being most satisfied by killing others, will
surely kill us.”

PURPORT

Animal sacrifice in the name of religion is current practically all over
the world in every established religion. It is said that Lord Jesus Christ,
when twelve years old, was shocked to see the Jews sacrificing birds and
animals in the synagogues and that he therefore rejected the Jewish
system of religion and started the religious system of Christianity, adher-
ing to the Old Testament commandment “Thou shalt not kill.” At the
present day, however, not only are animals killed in the name of
sacrifice, but the killing of animals has increased enormously because of
the increasing number of slaughterhouses. Slaughtering animals, either
for religion or for food, is most abominable and is condemned herein.
Unless one is merciless, one cannot sacrifice animals, either in the name
of religion or for food.

TRANSLATION
Therefore, day by day, one who is actually aware of religious

happily perform daily sacrifices and those for certain occasions
with whatever food is available easily by the grace of the Lord.
PURPORT
The word dharmavit, meaning 0116 who knows the actual purpose of
religion,” is very significant. As explained in Bhagavad-gita (18.66),
sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekari Saranam vraja: becoming Krsna
conscious is the topmost stage in understanding of religious principles.
One who reaches this stage performs the arcana process in devotional
service. Anyone, whether a grhastha or a sanmyasi, can keep small
Deities of the Lord suitably packed or, if possible, installed, and thus
worship the Deities of Radha-Krsna, Sita-Rama, Laksmi-Narayana, Lord
Jagannatha or Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu by offering food prepared in
ghee and then offering the sanctified prasdda to the forefathers,
demigods and other living entities as a matter of routine daily work. All
the centers of our Krsna consciousness movement have Deity worship
programs very nicely going on in which food is offered to the Deity and
distributed to the first-class brahmanas and Vaisnavas and even to the
people in general. This performance of sacrifice brings complete satisfac-
tion. The members of the Krsna consciousness movement engage daily in
such transcendental activities. Thus in our Krsna consciousness move-
ment there is no question at all of killing animals.

TRANSLATION

There are five branches of irreligion, appropriately known as ir-
religion [vidharma], religious principles for which one is unfit
[para-dharma], pretentious religion [abhasa], analogical religion
[upadharma] and cheating religion [chala-dharma]. One who is
aware of real religious life must abandon these five as irreligious.

PURPORT

Any religious principles opposed to the principle of surrendering to
the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, are to be
considered religious principles of irregularity or cheating, and one who is
actually interested in religion must give them up. One should simply
follow the instructions of Krsna and surrender unto Him. To do this, of
course, one needs very good intelligence, which may be awakened after
many, many births through good association with devotees and the prac-
tice of Krsna consciousness. Everything but the principle of religion
recommended by Krsna—sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam
$aranar vraja—should be given up as irreligion.

TRANSLATION

Religious principles that obstruct one from following his own
religion are called vidharma. Religious principles introduced by
others are called para-dharma. A new type of religion created by
one who is falsely proud and who opposes the principles of the
Vedas is called upadharma. And interpretation by one’s jugglery of
words is called chala-dharma.

PURPORT

To create a new type of dharma has become fashionable in this age.
So-called svamis and yogis support that one may follow any type of
religious system, according to one’s own choice, because all systems are
ultimately the same. In Srimad-Bhagavatam, however, such fashionable
ideas are called vidharma because they go against one’s own religious
system. The real religious system is described by the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead: sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekari saranam
vraja. The real religious system is that of surrender to the lotus feet of
the Lord. In the Sixth Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam, in connection with


--- Page 215 ---
Text 14] Instructions for Civilized Human Beings 211
Ajamila’s deliverance, Yamaraja says, dharmari tu saksad bhagavat-
pranitam: real religion is that which is given by the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, just as real law is that which is given by the government. No
one can manufacture actual law at home, nor can one manufacture actual
religion. Elsewhere it is said, sa vai purisam paro dharmo yato bhaktir
adhoksaje: the real religious system is that which leads one to become a
devotee of the Supreme Lord. Therefore, anything opposed to this
religious system of progressive Krsna consciousness is called vidharma,
para-dharma, upadharma or chala-dharma. Misinterpretation of
Bhagavad-gita is chala-dharma. When Krsna directly says something
and some rascal interprets it to mean something different, this is chala-
dharma—a religious system of cheating—or Sabda-bhit, a jugglery of
words. One should be extremely careful to avoid these various types of
cheating systems of religion.

TRANSLATION

A pretentious religious system manufactured by one who
willfully neglects the prescribed duties of his order of life is called
abhasa [a dim reflection or false similarity]. But if one performs
the prescribed duties for his particular arama or varna, why are
they not sufficient to mitigate all material distresses?


--- Page 216 ---
212 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 15
PURPORT

It is indicated here that everyone should strictly follow the principles
of varna and asrama as given in the $astra. In the Visnu Purana (3.8.9)
it is said:

varnasramacaravata
purusena parah puman
visnur aradhyate pantha
nanyat tat-tosa-karanam
One should focus upon the destination for progress, which is to become
Krsna conscious. This is the aim and end of all varnas and asramas.
However, if Visnu is not worshiped, the followers of the varnasrama in-
stitution manufacture some concocted God. Thus it has now become
fashionable for any rascal or fool to be elected God, and there are many
missionaries who have concocted their own gods, giving up their rela-
tionship with the real God. In Bhagavad-gita it is clearly said that one
who worships the demigods has lost his intelligence. Nonetheless we find
that even an illiterate person who has lost all intelligence is elected God,
and although he has a temple, it has meat-eating sannyasis, and many
polluted activities go on there. This type of religious system, which
misguides its poor followers, is strictly forbidden. Such pretentious
religions should be stopped altogether.

The original system is that a brahmana should actually become a
brahmana; he should not only take birth in a brahmana family, but
must also be qualified. Also, even if one is not born in a brahmana
family but has brahminical qualifications, he must be considered a
brahmana. By strictly following this system, one can be happy without
extra endeavor. Sva-bhava-vihito dharmah kasya nestah prasantaye.
The real aim of life is to mitigate distress, and one can do this very easily
by following the principles of sastra.

TRANSLATION

Even if a man is poor, he should not endeavor to improve his
economic condition just to maintain his body and soul together or
to become a famous religionist. Just as a great python, although
lying in one place, not endeavoring for its livelihood, gets the food
it needs to maintain body and soul, one who is desireless also ob-

tains his livelihood without endeavor.

PURPORT
Human life is simply meant for developing Krsna consciousness. One
need not even try to earn a livelihood to maintain body and soul together.
This is illustrated here by the example of the great python, which lies in
one place, never going here and there to earn a livelihood to maintain it-
self, and yet is maintained by the grace of the Lord. As advised by
Narada Muni (Bhag. 1.5.18), tasyaiva hetoh prayateta kovidah: one
should simply endeavor to increase his Krsna consciousness. One should
not desire to do anything else, even to earn his livelihood. There are
many, many examples of this attitude. Madhavendra Puri, for instance,
would never go to anyone to ask for food. Sukadeva Gosvami has also
said, kasrmad bhajanti kavayo dhana-durmadandhan. Why should one
approach a person who is blind with wealth? Rather, one should depend
on Krsna, and He will give everything. All the members of our Krsna
consciousness movement, whether they be grhasthas or sannyasis,


--- Page 218 ---
214 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 15
should try to spread the Krsna consciousness movement with determina-
tion, and Krsna will supply all necessities. The process of ajagara-vrtti,
the means of livelihood of a python, is very much appreciated in this
regard. Even though one may be very poor, he should simply try to ad-
vance in Krsna consciousness and not endeavor to earn his livelihood.

One who is content and satisfied and who links his activities with

enjoys transcendental happiness without endeavoring for his
livelihood. Where is such happiness for a materialistic man who is
impelled by lust and greed and who therefore wanders in all direc-
tions with a desire to accumulate wealth?

--- Page 220 ---
216 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 15
PURPORT
According to the $astras, a brahmana, or a cultured person in Krsna
consciousness, will not enter anyone’s service to maintain body and soul
together, and especially not for satisfaction of the senses. A true
brahmana is always satisfied. Even if he has nothing to eat, he can drink
a little water and be satisfied. This is only a matter of practice. Unfor-
tunately, however, no one is educated in how to be satisfied in self-
realization. As explained above, a devotee is always satisfied because he
feels the presence of the Supersoul within his heart and thinks of Him
twenty-four hours a day. That is real satisfaction. A devotee is never
driven by the dictations of the tongue and genitals, and thus he is never
victimized by the laws of material nature.

TRANSLATION

The strong bodily desires and needs of a person disturbed by
hunger and thirst are certainly satisfied when he eats. Similarly, if
one becomes very angry, that anger is satisfied by chastisement and
its reaction. But as for greed, even if a greedy person has con-
quered all the directions of the world or has enjoyed everything in
the world, still he will not be satisfied.

PURPORT

In Bhagavad-gita (3.37) it is stated that lust, anger and greed are the
causes of the conditioned soul’s bondage in this material world. Kama
esa krodha esa rajo-guna-samudbhavah. When strong lusty desires for
sense gratification are unfulfilled, one becomes angry. This anger can be
satisfied when one chastises his enemy, but when there is an increase in
lobha, or greed, which is the greatest enemy caused by rajo-guna, the
mode of passion, how can one advance in Krsna consciousness?

If one is very greedy to enhance his Krsna consciousness, this is a
great boon. Tatra laulyam ekalarh milam. This is the best path availa-
ble.

TRANSLATION

O King Yudhisthira, many persons with varied experience,
many legal advisers, many learned scholars and many persons eli-
gible to become presidents of learned assemblies fall down into
hellish life because of not being satisfied with their positions.

PURPORT

For spiritual advancement, one should be materially satisfied, for if
one is not materially satisfied, his greed for material development will
result in the frustration of his spiritual advancement. There are two
things that nullify all good qualities. One is poverty. Daridra-doso guna-
rasi-nasi. If one is poverty-stricken, all his good qualities become null
and void. Similarly, if one becomes too greedy, his good qualifications are
lost. Therefore the adjustment is that one should not be poverty-stricken,
but one must try to be fully satisfied with the bare necessities of life and
not be greedy. For a devotee to be satisfied with the bare necessities is
therefore the best advice for spiritual advancement. Learned authorities
in devotional life consequently advise that one not endeavor to increase
the number of temples and mathas. Such activities can be undertaken
only by devotees experienced in propagating the Krsna consciousness
movement. All the dcaryas in South India, especially Sri Ramanujicarya,
constructed many big temples, and in North India all the Gosvimis of
Vrndavana constructed large temples. Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati
Thakura also constructed large centers, known as Gaudiya Mathas.
Therefore temple construction is not bad, provided proper care is taken
for the propagation of Krsna consciousness. Even if such endeavors are


--- Page 223 ---
Text 22] Instructions for Civilized Human Beings 219
considered greedy, the greed is to satisfy Krsna, and therefore these are
spiritual activities.

By making plans with determination, one should give up lusty
desires for sense gratification. Similarly, by giving up envy one
should conquer anger, by discussing the disadvantages of ac-
cumulating wealth one should give up greed, and by discussing the
truth one should give up fear.

PURPORT

Srila Viévanatha Cakravarti Thakura has suggested how one can con-
quer lusty desires for sense gratification. One cannot give up thinking of
women, for thinking in this way is natural; even while walking on the
street, one will see so many women. However, if one is determined not to
live with a woman, even while seeing a woman he will not become lusty.
If one is determined not to have sex, he can automatically conquer lusty
desires. The example given in this regard is that even if one is hungry, if
on a particular day he is determined to observe fasting, he can naturally
conquer the disturbances of hunger and thirst. If one is determined not


--- Page 224 ---
220 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 15
to be envious of anyone, he can naturally conquer anger. Similarly, one
can give up the desire to accumulate wealth simply by considering how
difficult it is to protect the money in one’s possession. If one keeps a large
amount of cash with him, he is always anxious about keeping it properly.
Thus if one discusses the disadvantages of accumulating wealth, he can
naturally give up business without difficulty.

If one’s son has died, one may certainly be affected by lamentation and
illusion and cry for the dead son, but one may overcome lamentation and
illusion by considering the verses of Bhagavad-gita.

Text 24] Instructions for Civilized Human Beings 221
As the soul transmigrates, one who has taken birth must give up the
present body, and then he must certainly accept another body. This
should be no cause for lamentation. Therefore Lord Krsna says, dhiras
tatra na muhyati: one who is dhira, or sober, who is learned in philoso-
phy and established in knowledge, cannot be unhappy over the
transmigration of the soul.

By good behavior and freedom from envy one should counteract
sufferings due to other living entities, by meditation in trance one
should counteract sufferings due to providence, and by practicing
hatha-yoga, pranayama and so forth one should counteract suffer-
ings due to the body and mind. Similarly, by developing the mode
of goodness, especially in regard to eating, one should conquer
sleep.

PURPORT

By practice, one should avoid eating in such a way that other living en-

tities will be disturbed and suffer. Since I suffer when pinched or killed


--- Page 226 ---
222 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 15
by others, I should not attempt to pinch or kill any other living entity.
People do not know that because of killing innocent animals they them-
selves will have to suffer severe reactions from material nature. Any
country where people indulge in unnecessary killing of animals will have
to suffer from wars and pestilence imposed by material nature. Compar-
ing one’s own suffering to the suffering of others, therefore, one should
be kind to all living entities. One cannot avoid the sufferings inflicted by
providence, and therefore when suffering comes one should fully absorb
oneself in chanting the Hare Krsna mantra. One can avoid sufferings
from the body and mind by practicing mystic hatha-yoga.

tion. In this way one can conquer the influence of the modes of
nature.

Text 26] Instructions for Civilized Human Beings 223
PURPORT

Just by treating the root cause of an ailment, one can conquer all
bodily pains and sufferings. Similarly, if one is devoted and faithful to
the spiritual master, he can conquer the influence of sattva-guna, rajo-
guna and tamo-guna very easily. Yogis and jianis practice in many ways
to conquer the senses, but the bhakta immediately attains the mercy of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead through the mercy of the spiritual
master. Yasya prasadad bhagavat-prasado. If the spiritual master is
favorably inclined, one naturally receives the mercy of the Supreme
Lord, and by the mercy of the Supreme Lord one immediately becomes
transcendental, conquering all the influences of sattva-guna, rajo-guna
and tamo-guna within this material world. This is confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita (sa gundn samatityaitan brahma-bhityaya kalpate). If
one is a pure devotee acting under the directions of the guru, one easily
gets the mercy of the Supreme Lord and thus becomes immediately situ-
ated on the transcendental platform. This is explained in the next verse.

considers the spiritual master to be like an ordinary human being and

TRANSLATION

The spiritual master should be considered to be directly the

Supreme Lord because he gives transcendental knowledge for

enlightenment. Consequently, for one who maintains the material
conception that the spiritual master is an ordinary human being,
everything is frustrated. His enlightenment and his Vedic studies
and knowledge are like the bathing of an elephant. ४
PURPORT

It is recommended that one honor the spiritual master as being on
an equal status with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Saksad
dharitvena samasta-sastraih. This is enjoined in every scripture.
Acaryam mar vijanityat. One should consider the ৫০৫7৫ to be as good as
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In spite of all these instructions, if
one considers the spiritual master an ordinary human being, one is
doomed. His study of the Vedas and his austerities and penances for en-
lightenment are all useless, like the bathing of an elephant. An elephant
bathes in a lake quite thoroughly, but as soon as it comes on the shore it
takes some dust from the ground and strews it over its body. Thus there
is no meaning to the elephant’s bath. One may argue by saying that since
the spiritual master’s relatives and the men of his neighborhood consider
him an ordinary human being, what is the fault on the part of the disci-
ple who considers the spiritual master an ordinary human being? This
will be answered in the next verse, but the injunction is that the spiritual
master should never be considered an ordinary man. One should strictly
adhere to the instructions of the spiritual master, for if he is pleased, cer-
tainly the Supreme Personality of Godhead is pleased. Yasya prasadad
bhagavat-prasado yasyaprasadan na gatih kuto ‘pi.

are sought; lokah—people in general; yam—Him; manyate —consider;
naram—a human being.

TRANSLATION

The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Krsna, is the master
of all other living entities and of the material nature. His lotus feet
are sought and worshiped by great saintly persons like Vyasa.
Nonetheless, there are fools who consider Lord Krsna an ordinary
human being.

PURPORT

The example of Lord Krsna’s being the Supreme Personality of God-
head is appropriate in regard to understanding the spiritual master. The
spiritual master is called sevaka-bhagavan, the servitor Personality of
Godhead, and Krsna is called sevya-bhagavan, the Supreme Personality
of Godhead who is to be worshiped. The spiritual master is the worshiper
God, whereas the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, is the
worshipable God. This is the difference between the spiritual master and
the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Another point: Bhagavad-gita, which constitutes the instructions of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is presented by the spiritual master
as it is, without deviation. Therefore the Absolute Truth is present in the
spiritual master. As clearly stated in Text 26, jiana-dipa-prade. The
Supreme Personality of Godhead gives real knowledge to the entire
world, and the spiritual master, as the representative of the Supreme
Godhead, carries the message throughout the world. Therefore, on the
absolute platform, there is no difference between the spiritual master
and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If someone considers the
Supreme Personality —Krsna or Lord Ramacandra—to be an ordinary
human being, this does not mean that the Lord becomes an ordinary
human being. Similarly, if the family members of the spiritual master,
who is the bona fide representative of the Supreme Personality of God-
head, consider the spiritual master an ordinary human being, this does
not mean that he becomes an ordinary human being. The spiritual


--- Page 230 ---
226 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 15
master is as good as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore
one who is very serious about spiritual advancement must regard the
spiritual master in this way. Even a slight deviation from this under-
standing can create disaster in the disciple’s Vedic studies and austerities.

Ritualistic ceremonies, regulative principles, austerities and the
practice of yoga are all meant to control the senses and mind, but
even after one is able to control the senses and mind, if he does not
come to the point of meditation upon the Supreme Lord, all such
activities are simply labor in frustration.
PURPORT
One may argue that one may achieve the ultimate goal of life —realiza-
tion of the Supersoul—by practicing the yoga system and ritualistic
performances according to the Vedic principles, even without staunch
devotion to the spiritual master. The actual fact, however, is that by
practicing yoga one must come to the platform of meditating upon the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. As stated in the scriptures,


--- Page 231 ---
Text 29] Instructions for Civilized Human Beings 227
dhyanavasthita-tad-gatena manasa pasyanti yam yoginah: a person in
meditation achieves the perfection of yoga practice when he can see the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. By various practices, one may come to
the point of controlling the senses, but simply controlling the senses does
not bring one to a substantial conclusion. However, by staunch faith in
the spiritual master and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one not
only controls the senses but also realizes the Supreme Lord.

“Only unto those great souls who have implicit faith in both the Lord and

automatically revealed.” (Svetasvatara Upanisad 6.23) It is further
stated, tusyeyarn sarva-bhitatma guru-Susrisaya and taranty कन्म
bhavarnavam. Simply by rendering service to the spiritual master, one
crosses the ocean of nescience and returns home, back to Godhead. Thus
he gradually sees the Supreme Lord face to face and enjoys life in asso-
ciation with the Lord. The ultimate goal of yoga is to come in contact
with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Unless this point is achieved,
one’s so-called yoga practice is simply labor without any benefit.

TRANSLATION

As professional activities or business profits cannot help one in
spiritual advancement but are a source of material entanglement,
the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies cannot help anyone who is not a
devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

PURPORT

If one becomes very rich through his professional activities, through
trade or through agriculture, this does not mean that he is spiritually ad-
vanced. To be spiritually advanced is different from being materially
rich. Although the purpose of life is to become spiritually rich, unfortu-
nate men, misguided as they are, are always engaged in trying to become
materially rich. Such material engagements, however, do not help one in
the actual fulfillment of the human mission. On the contrary, material
engagements lead one to be attracted to many unnecessary necessities,
which are accompanied by the risk that one may be born in a degraded
condition. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (14.18):

ardhvam gacchanti sattva-stha
madhye tisthanti rajasah
Jaghanya-guna-vrtti-stha
adho gacchanti tamasah

“Those situated in the mode of goodness gradually go upward to the
higher planets; those in the mode of passion live on the earthly planets;
and those in the mode of ignorance go down to the hellish worlds.” Es-
pecially in this Kali-yuga, material advancement means degradation and
attraction to many unwanted necessities that create a low mentality.
Therefore, jaghanya-guna-vrtti-stha: since people are contaminated by
the lower qualities, they will lead their next lives either as animals or in
other degraded forms of life. Making a show of religion without Krsna
consciousness may make one popular in the estimation of unintelligent


--- Page 233 ---
Text 30] Instructions for Civilized Human Beings 229
men, but factually such a materialistic display of spiritual advancement
does not help one at all; it will not prevent one from missing the goal of
life.

TRANSLATION
One who desires to conquer the mind must leave the company of
his family and live in a solitary place, free from contaminated asso-
ciation. To maintain the body and soul together, he should beg as
much as he needs for the bare necessities of life.
PURPORT
This is the process for conquering the agitation of the mind. One is
recommended to take leave of his family and live alone, maintaining
body and soul together by begging alms and eating only as much as
needed to keep himself alive. Without such a process, one cannot con-
quer lusty desires. Sannydsa means accepting a life of begging, which
makes one automatically very humble and meek and free from lusty
desires. In this regard, the following verse appears in the Smrti
literature:
dvandvahatasya garhasthyarn

In this world of duality, family life is the cause that spoils one’s spiritual
life or meditation. Specifically understanding this fact, one should accept
the order of sannydsa without hesitation.

TRANSLATION
My dear King, in a sacred and holy place of pilgrimage one
should select a place in which to perform yoga. The place must be
level and not too high or low. There one should sit very comforta-
bly, being steady and equipoised, keeping his body straight, and
thus begin chanting the Vedic pranava.
PURPORT
Generally the chanting of ori is recommended because in the begin-
ning one cannot understand the Personality of Godhead. As stated in
Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.11):
vadanti tat tattva-vidas
tattvarn yaj jiagnam advayam

Text 31] Instructions for Civilized Human Beings 231
brahmeti paramatmeti
bhagavan iti sabdyate
“Learned transcendentalists who know the Absolute Truth call this non-
dual substance Brahman, Paramatma or Bhagavan.” Unless one is fully
convinced of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one has the tendency
to become an impersonalist yogi searching for the Supreme Lord within
the core of his heart (dhyanavasthita-tad-gatena manasa pasyanti yar
yoginah). Here the chanting of oritkara is recommended because in the
beginning of transcendental realization, instead of chanting the Hare
Krsna maha-mantra, one may chant orikara (pranava). There is no dif-
ference between the Hare Krsna maha-mantra and orikara because both
of them are sound representations of the Supreme Personality of God-
head. Pranavah sarva-vedesu. In all Vedic literatures, the sound vibra-
tion orikara is the beginning. Ori namo bhagavate vasudevaya. The dif-
ference between chanting orikara and chanting the Hare Krsna mantra
is that the Hare Krsna mantra may be chanted without consideration of
the place or the sitting arrangements recommended in Bhagavad-gita
(6.11):
Sucau dese pratisthapya
sthiram asanam atmanah
naty-ucchritarn natinicarn
cailajina-kusottaram

“To practice yoga, one should go to a secluded place and should lay kusa
grass on the ground and then cover it with a deerskin and a soft cloth.
The seat should neither be too high nor too low and should be situated in
a sacred place.” The Hare Krsna mantra may be chanted by anyone,
without consideration of the place or how one sits. Sri Caitanya Maha-
prabhu has openly declared, niyamitah smarane na kalah. In chanting
the Hare Krsna maha-mantra there are no particular injunctions regard-
ing one’s sitting place. The injunction niyamitah smarane na kalah
includes desa, kala and patra—place, time and the individual. Therefore
anyone may chant the Hare Krsna mantra, without consideration of the
time and place. Especially in this age, Kali-yuga, it is very difficult to find
a suitable place according to the recommendations of Bhagavad-gita. The
Hare Krsna maha-mantra, however, may be chanted at any place and
any time, and this will bring results very quickly. Yet even while


--- Page 236 ---
232 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 15
chanting the Hare Krsna mantra one may observe regulative principles.
Thus while sitting and chanting one may keep his body straight, and this
will help one in the chanting process; otherwise one may feel sleepy.

known as क्षा, kumbhaka and recaka—controlling inhalation
and exhalation and then stopping them both. In this way the yogi
restricts his mind from material attachments and gives up all men-
tal desires. As soon as the mind, being defeated by lusty desires,
drifts toward feelings of sense gratification, the yogi should im-
mediately bring it back and arrest it within the core of his heart.
PURPORT

The practice of yoga is concisely explained herein. When this practice
of yoga is perfect, one sees the Supersoul, the Paramatma feature of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, within the core of one’s heart.
However, in Bhagavad-gita (6.47) the Supreme Lord says:

yogindam api sarvesam
mad-gatenantaratmana
Sraddhavan bhajate yo mam
sa me yuktatamo matah
“Of all yogis, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping
Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in
yoga and is the highest of all.” A devotee can immediately become a per-
fect yogi because he practices keeping Krsna constantly within the core
of his heart. This is another way to practice yoga easily. The Lord says:
man-mana bhava mad-bhakto
mad-yaji mar namaskuru

“Always think of Me and become My devotee. Worship Me and offer
your homage unto Me.” (Bg. 18.65) If one practices devotional service
by always keeping Krsna within the core of his heart (man-manah), he
immediately becomes a first-class yogi. Furthermore, keeping Krsna
within the mind is not a difficult task for the devotee. For an ordinary
man in the bodily concept of life, the practice of yoga may be helpful,
but one who immediately takes to devotional service can immediately be-
come a perfect yogi without difficulty.

cessation; tasya—of him; nirvanam —purification from all material con-
tamination; yati—reaches; anindhana—without flame or smoke; vahni-
vat—like a fire.
TRANSLATION
When the yogi regularly practices in this way, in a short time his
heart becomes fixed and free from disturbance, like a fire without
flames or smoke.
PURPORT
Nirvana means the cessation of all material desires. Sometimes
desirelessness is understood to imply an end to the workings of the mind,
but this is not possible. The living entity has senses, and if the senses
stopped working, the living entity would no longer be a living entity; he
would be exactly like stone or wood. This is not possible. Because he is
living, he is nitya and cetana—eternally sentient. For those who are not
very advanced, the practice of yoga is recommended in order to stop the
mind from being agitated by material desires, but if one fixes his mind
on the lotus feet of Krsna, his mind naturally becomes peaceful very
soon. This peace is described in Bhagavad-gita (5.29):
bhoktarari yajiia-tapasarit
sarva-loka-mahesvaram
suhrdam sarva-bhitanarm
JAatva mar santim rcchati


--- Page 239 ---
Text 35] Instructions for Civilized Human Beings 235
If one can understand Krsna as the supreme enjoyer, the supreme
proprietor of everything, and the supreme friend of everyone, one is
established in peace and is free from material agitation. However, for one
who cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the prac-
tice of yoga is recommended.

236 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 15
“One who is transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme
Brahman and becomes fully joyful. He never laments nor desires to have
anything; he is equally disposed toward every living entity. In this situa-
tion, he begins transcendental activities, or devotional service to the
Lord.” Generally, once elevated to the transcendental platform of
brahma-sukha, transcendental bliss, one never comes down. But if one
does not engage in devotional service, there is a chance of his returning
to the material platform. Aruhya krcchrena [0070 778 pada tatah patanty
adho ’nadrta-yusmad-arighrayah: one may rise to the platform of
brahma-sukha, transcendental bliss, but even from that platform one
may fall down to the material platform if he does not engage himself in
devotional service.

TRANSLATION

One who accepts the sannyasa order gives up the three prin-
ciples of materialistic activities in which one indulges in the field
of household life —namely religion, economic development and
sense gratification. One who first accepts sannyasa but then returns


--- Page 241 ---
Text 37] Instructions for Civilized Human Beings 237
to such materialistic activities is to be called a vantasi, or one who
eats his own vomit. He is indeed a shameless person.
PURPORT

Materialistic activities are regulated by the institution of varnasrama-
dharma. Without varnasrama-dharma, materialistic activities constitute
animal life. Yet even in human life, while observing the principles of
varna and @srama—brahmana, ksatriya, vaiSya, $0070, brahmacarya,
grhastha, vanaprastha and sannydsa—one must ultimately accept
sannyasa, the renounced order, for only by the renounced order can one
be situated in brahma-sukha, or transcendental bliss. In brahma-sukha
one is no longer attracted by lusty desires. Indeed, when one is no longer
disturbed, especially by lusty desires for sexual indulgence, he is fit to
become a sannyasi. Otherwise, one should not accept the sannyasa order.
If one accepts sannydsa at an immature stage, there is every possibility
of his being attracted by women and lusty desires and thus again becom-
ing a so-called grhastha or a victim of women. Such a person is most
shameless, and he is called vantasi, or one who eats that which he has
already vomited. He certainly leads a condemned life. In our Krsna con-
sciousness movement it is advised, therefore, that the sannyasis and
brahmacdris keep strictly aloof from the association of women so that
there will be no chance of their falling down again as victims of lusty
desires.

persons; enam—this body; atmasat krtva—again identifying with the

TRANSLATION

Sannyasis who first consider that the body is subject to death,
when it will be transformed into stool, worms or ashes, but who
again give importance to the body and glorify it as the self, are to
be considered the greatest rascals.

PURPORT

A sannyasi is one who has clearly understood, through advancement
in knowledge, that Brahman —he, the person himself —is the soul, not
the body. One who has this understanding may take sannyasa, for
he is situated in the ‘“‘ahari brahmasmi’ position. Brahma-bhiitah
prasannatma na Socati na kariksati. Such a person, who no longer
laments or hankers to maintain his body and who can accept all living en-
tities as spirit souls, can then enter the devotional service of the Lord. If
one does not enter the devotional service of the Lord but artificially con-
siders himself Brahman or Narayana, not perfectly understanding that
the soul and body are different, one certainly falls down (patanty
adhah). Such a person again gives importance to the body. There are
many sannydsis in India who stress the importance of the body. Some of
them give special importance to the body of the poor man, accepting him
as daridra-narayana, as if Narayana had a material body. Many other
sanmnyasis stress the importance of the social position of the body as a
brahmana, ksatriya, vaiya or Sitdra. Such sannyasis are considered the
greatest rascals (asattamah). They are shameless because they have not
yet understood the difference between the body and the soul and instead
have accepted the body of a brahmana to be a brahmana. Brahmanism
(brahmanya) consists of the knowledge of Brahman. But actually the
body of a brahmana is not Brahman. Similarly, the body is neither rich
nor poor. If the body of a poor man were daridra-narayana, this would
mean that the body of a rich man, on the contrary, must be dhani-
narayana. Therefore sannyasis who do not know the meaning of
Narayana, those who regard the body as Brahman or as Narayana, are


--- Page 243 ---
Text 39] Instructions for Civilized Human Beings 239
described here as asattamah, the most abominable rascals. Following the
bodily concept of life, such sannyasts make various programs to serve
the body. They conduct farcical missions consisting of so-called religious
activities meant to mislead all of human society. These sannyasis have
been described herein as apatrapeh and asattamah—shameless and
fallen from spiritual life.

TRANSLATION

It is abominable for a person living in the grhastha-asrama to
give up the regulative principles, for a brahmacari not to follow
the brahmaciri vows while living under the care of the guru, for a
vanaprastha to live in the village and engage in so-called social ac-
tivities, or for a sannyaisi to be addicted to sense gratification. One
who acts in this way is to be considered the lowest renegade. Such a
pretender is bewildered by the external energy of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, and one should either reject him from
any position, or taking compassion upon him, teach him, if possi-
ble, to resume his original position.

PURPORT

We have repeatedly stressed that human culture does not begin unless
one takes to the principles of varnasrama-dharma. Although grhastha
life is a concession for the enjoyment of sex, one cannot enjoy sex with-
out following the rules and regulations of householder life. Furthermore,
as already instructed, a brahmacari must live under the care of the guru:
brahmacari guru-kule vasan danto guror hitam. If a brahmacart does
not live under the care of the guru, if a vanaprastha engages in ordinary
activities, or if a sannydsiis greedy and eats meat, eggs and all kinds of
nonsense for the satisfaction of his tongue, he is a cheater and should im-
mediately be rejected as unimportant. Such persons should be shown
compassion, and if one has sufficient strength one should teach them to
stop them from following the wrong path in life. Otherwise one should
reject them and pay them no attention.

TRANSLATION

The human form of body is meant for understanding the self
and the Supreme Self, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, both
of whom are transcendentally situated. If both of them can be
understood when one is purified by advanced knowledge, for what
reason and for whom does a foolish, greedy person maintain the
body for sense gratification?

PURPORT

Of course, everyone in this material world is interested in maintaining
the body for sense gratification, but by cultivating knowledge one should
gradually understand that the body is not the self. Both the soul and the
Supersoul are transcendental to the material world. This is to be under-
stood in the human form of life, especially when one takes sannydsa. A
sannyasi, one who has understood the self, should be engaged in elevat-
ing the self and associating with the Superself. Our Krsna consciousness
movement is meant for elevating the living being for promotion back
home, back to Godhead. Seeking such elevation is one’s duty in the
human form of life. Unless one performs this duty, why should one
maintain the body? Especially if a sannyasi not only maintains the body
by ordinary means but does everything to maintain the body, including
even eating meat and other abominable things, he must be a lampatah, a
greedy person simply engaged in sense gratification. A sannydsi must
specifically remove himself from the urges of the tongue, belly and
genitals, which disturb one as long as one is not fully aware that the body
is separate from the soul.

TRANSLATION
Transcendentalists who are advanced in knowledge compare the
body, which is made by the order of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, to a chariot. The senses are like the horses; the mind,
the master of the senses, is like the reins; the objects of the senses
are the destinations; intelligence is the chariot driver; and con-
sciousness, which spreads throughout the body, is the cause of
bondage in this material world.
PURPORT
For a bewildered person in the materialistic way of life, the body, the
mind and the senses, which are engaged in sense gratification, are the
cause of bondage to repeated birth, death, old age and disease. But for
one who is advanced in spiritual knowledge, the same body, senses and
mind are the cause of liberation. This is confirmed in the Katha
Upanisad (1.3.3-4,9) as follows:
atmanari rathinam viddhi
Sarirarh ratham eva ca
buddhiri tu sarathir viddhi
manah pragraham eva ca


--- Page 247 ---
Text 41] Instructions for Civilized Human Beings 243
indriyani hayan ahur
visayaris tesu gocaran
so ’dhvanah param apnoti
tad visnoh paramari padam
The soul is the occupant of the chariot of the body, of which the driver is
the intelligence. The mind is the determination to reach the destination,
the senses are the horses, and the sense objects are also included in that
activity. Thus one can reach the destination, Visnu, who is paramam
padam, the supreme goal of life. In conditioned life the consciousness in
the body is the cause of bondage, but the same consciousness, when
transformed into Krsna consciousness, becomes the cause for one’s
returning home, back to Godhead.

The human body, therefore, may be used in two ways—for going to
the darkest regions of ignorance or for going forward, back home, back
to Godhead. To go back to Godhead, the path is mahat-seva, to accept the
self-realized spiritual master. Mahat-sevarn dvaram ahur vimukteh. For
liberation, one should accept the direction of authorized devotees who
can actually endow one with perfect knowledge. On the other hand,
tamo-dvdrari yositarn sangi-sangam: if one wants to go to the darkest
regions of material existence, one may continue to associate with persons
who are attached to women (yositar sangi-sarigam). The word yosit
means ‘“‘woman.” Persons who are too materialistic are attached to
women.

It is said, therefore, atmanarm rathinam viddhi sarirarm ratham eva
ca. The body is just like a chariot or car in which one may go anywhere.
One may drive well, or else one may drive whimsically, in which case it is
quite possible that he may have an accident and fall into a ditch. In other
words, if one takes directions from the experienced spiritual master one
can go back home, back to Godhead; otherwise, one may return to the
cycle of birth and death. Therefore Krsna personally advises:

asraddadhanah purusa
dharmasyasya parantapa

aprapya mar nivartante
mrtyu-sarsara-vartmani


--- Page 248 ---
244 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 15
“Those who are not faithful on the path of devotional service cannot at-
tain Me, O conqueror of foes, but return to birth and death in this ma-
terial world.” (Bg. 9.3) The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna,
personally gives instructions on how one can return home, back to God-
head, but if one does not care to listen to His instructions, the result will
be that one will never go back to Godhead, but will continue life in this
miserable condition of repeated birth and death in material existence
(mrtyu-samsara-vartmani).

The advice of experienced transcendentalists, therefore, is that the
body be fully engaged for achieving the ultimate goal of life (svartha-
gatim). The real interest or goal of life is to return home, back to God-
head. To enable one to fulfill this purpose, there are so many Vedic
literatures, including Vedanta-sitra, the Upanisads, Bhagavad-gita,
Mahabharata and the Ramayana. One should take lessons from these
Vedic literatures and learn how to practice nivrtti-marga. Then one’s life
will be perfect. The body is important as long as it has consciousness.
Without consciousness, the body is merely a lump of matter. Therefore,
to return home, back to Godhead, one must change his consciousness
from material consciousness to Krsna consciousness. One’s consciousness
is the cause of material bondage, but if this consciousness is purified by
bhakti-yoga, one can then understand the falsity of his upadhi, his
designations as Indian, American, Hindu, Muslim, Christian and so on.
Sarvopadhi-vinirmuktari tat-paratvena nirmalam. One must forget
these designations and use this consciousness only for the service of
Krsna. Therefore if one takes advantage of the Krsna consciousness
movement, his life is certainly successful.

aksam—the spokes (on the chariot wheel); dasa—ten; pranam—the
ten kinds of air flowing within the body; adharma—irreligion;
dharmau—religion (two sides of the wheel, up and down); cakre—in
the wheel; abhimanam —false identification; rathinam—the charioteer
or master of the body; ca—also; jivam—the living entity; dhanuh—the

TRANSLATION

The ten kinds of air acting within the body are compared to the
spokes of the chariot’s wheels, and the top and bottom of the
wheel itself are called religion and irreligion. The living entity in
the bodily concept of life is the owner of the chariot. The Vedic
mantra pranava is the bow, the pure living entity himself is the ar-
row, and the target is the Supreme Being.

PURPORT

Ten kinds of life air always flow within the material body. They are
called prana, apana, samana, vyana, uddna, naga, karma, krkala,
devadatta and dhanafijaya. They are compared here to the spokes of the
chariot’s wheels. The life air is the energy for all of a living being’s ac-
tivities, which are sometimes religious and sometimes irreligious. Thus
religion and irreligion are said to be the upper and lower portions of the
chariot’s wheels. When the living entity decides to go back home, back to
Godhead, his target is Lord Visnu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
In the conditioned state of life, one does not understand that the goal of
life is the Supreme Lord. Na te viduh svartha-gatirm hi visnuri durd@saya
ye bahir-artha-maninah. The living entity tries to be happy within this
material world, not understanding the target of his life. When he is
purified, however, he gives up his bodily conception of life and his false
identity as belonging to a certain community, a certain nation, a certain
society, a certain family and so on (sarvopadhi-vinirmuktarn tat-


--- Page 250 ---
246 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 15
paratvena nirmalam). Then he takes the arrow of his purified life, and
with the help of the bow —the transcendental chanting of pranava, or
the Hare Krsna mantra—he throws himself toward the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead.

Srila Vidvanitha Cakravarti Thikura has commented that because the
words “bow” and “arrow” are used in this verse, one might argue that
the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the living entity have become
enemies. However, although the Supreme Personality of Godhead may
become the so-called enemy of the living being, this is His chivalrous
pleasure. For example, the Lord fought with Bhisma, and when Bhisma
pierced the Lord’s body on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra, this was a kind
of humor or relationship, of which there are twelve. When the condi-
tioned soul tries to reach the Lord by hurling an arrow at Him, the Lord
takes pleasure, and the living entity gains the profit of going back home,
back to Godhead. Another example given in this regard is that Arjuna, as
a result of piercing the adhdra-mina, or the fish within the cakra,
achieved the valuable gain of Draupadi. Similarly, if with the arrow of
chanting the holy name of the Lord one pierces Lord Visnu’s lotus feet,
by dint of performing this heroic activity of devotional service one
receives the benefit of returning home, back to Godhead.

TRANSLATION

In the conditioned stage, one’s conceptions of life are sometimes
polluted by passion and ignorance, which are exhibited by attach-
ment, hostility, greed, lamentation, illusion, fear, madness, false
prestige, insults, fault-finding, deception, envy, intolerance, pas-
sion, bewilderment, hunger and sleep. All of these are enemies.
Sometimes one’s conceptions are also polluted by goodness.

PURPORT

The actual aim of life is to go back home, back to Godhead, but there
are many hindrances created by the three modes of material .nature—
sometimes by a combination of rajo-guna and tamo-guna, the modes of
passion and ignorance, and sometimes by the mode of goodness. In the
material world, even if one is a philanthropist, a nationalist and a good
man according to materialistic estimations, these conceptions of life form
a hindrance to spiritual advancement. How much more of a hindrance,
then, are hostility, greed, illusion, lamentation and too much attachment
to material enjoyment? To progress toward the target of Visnu, which is
our real self-interest, one must become very powerful in conquering
these various hindrances or enemies. In other words, one should not be
attached to being a good man or a bad man in this material world.

In this material world, so-called goodness and badness are the same
because they consist of the three modes of material nature. One must
transcend this material nature. Even the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies
consist of the three modes of material nature. Therefore Krsna advised
Arjuna:

248 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 15
traigunya-visaya veda
nistraigunyo bhavarjuna
nirdvandvo nitya-sattva-stho
॥ niryoga-ksema atmavan
“The Vedas mainly deal with the subject of the three modes of material
nature. Rise above these modes, O Arjuna. Be transcendental to all of
them. Be free from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and
safety, and be established in the self.” (Bg. 2.45) Elsewhere in
Bhagavad-gita the Lord says, iardhvarih gacchanti sattva-sthah: if one
becomes a very good person—in other words, if one is in the mode of
goodness—he may be elevated to the higher planetary systems.
Similarly, if one is infected by rajo-guna and tamo-guna, he may remain
in this world or go down to the animal kingdom. But all of these situa-
tions are hindrances on the path of spiritual salvation. Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu therefore says:
brahmanda bhramite kona bhagyavan jiva
guru-krsna-prasade paya bhakti-lata-bija
If one is fortunate enough to transcend all this so-called goodness and
badness and come to the platform of devotional service by the mercy of
Krsna and the guru, his life becomes successful. In this regard, one must
be very bold so that he can conquer these enemies of Krsna conscious-
ness. Not caring for the good and bad of this material world, one must
boldly propagate Krsna consciousness.

TRANSLATION

As long as one has to accept a material body, with its different
parts and paraphernalia, which are not fully under one’s control,
one must have the lotus feet of his superiors, namely his spiritual
master and the spiritual master’s predecessors. By their mercy,
one can sharpen the sword of knowledge, and with the power of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead’s mercy one must then con-
quer the enemies mentioned above. In this way, the devotee
should be able to merge into his own transcendental bliss, and
then he may give up his body and resume his spiritual identity.

PURPORT
In Bhagavad-gita (4.9) the Lord says:
janma karma ca me divyam
evarh yo vetti tattvatah
tyaktva dehari punar janma
naiti mam eti so ’rjuna

“One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and ac-
tivities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this


--- Page 254 ---
250 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 15
material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.” This is the
highest perfection of life, and the human body is meant for this purpose.
It is said in Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.20.17):
nr-deham adyari sulabhariv sudurlabharm
plavar sukalpari guru-karmadharam
mayanukitlena nabhasvateritarin
puman bhavabdhiri na taret sa atma-ha
This human form of body is a most valuable boat, and the spiritual
master is the captain, guru-karnadharam, to guide the boat in plying
across the ocean of nescience. The instruction of Krsna is a favorable
breeze. One must use all these facilities to cross over the ocean of ne-
science. Since the spiritual master is the captain, one must serve the
spiritual master very sincerely so that by his mercy one will be able to get
the mercy of the Supreme Lord.

A significant word here is acyuta-balah. The spiritual master is cer-
tainly very merciful to his disciples, and consequently by satisfying him
a devotee gets strength from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu therefore says, guru-krsna-prasade paya bhakti-
lata-bija: one must first please the spiritual master, and then one auto-
matically pleases Krsna and gets the strength with which to cross the
ocean of nescience. If one seriously desires to return home, back to God-
head, one must therefore become strong enough by pleasing the spiritual
master, for thus one gets the weapon with which to conquer the enemy,
and one also gets the grace of Krsna. Simply getting the weapon of [ताप्य
is insufficient. One must sharpen the weapon by serving the spiritual
master and adhering to his instructions. Then the candidate will get the
mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In general warfare one
must take help from his chariot and horses in order to conquer his
enemy, and after conquering his enemies he may give up the chariot and
its paraphernalia. Similarly, as long as one has a human body, one should
fully use it to obtain the highest perfection of life, namely going back
home, back to Godhead.

The perfection of knowledge is certainly to become transcendentally
situated (brahma-bhiita). As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (18.54):


--- Page 255 ---
Text 45] Instructions for Civilized Human Beings 251
brahma-bhiitah prasannatma
na socati na karksati
samah sarvesu bhitesu
mad-bhaktirh labhate param
“One who is transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme
Brahman and becomes fully joyful. He never laments nor desires to have
anything; he is equally disposed toward all living entities. In that state he
attains pure devotional service.” Simply by cultivating knowledge as the
impersonalists do, one cannot get out of the clutches of maya. One must
attain the platform of bhakti.
bhaktya mam abhijanati
yavan yas casmi tattvatah
tato mam tattvato [72100
visate tad-anantaram
“One can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devo-
tional service. And when one is in full consciousness of the Supreme
Lord by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of God.”
(Bg. 18.55) Unless one has attained the stage of devotional service and
the mercy of the spiritual master and Krsna, there is a possibility that
one may fall down and again accept a material body. Therefore Krsna
stresses in Bhagavad-gita (4.9):
Jjanma karma ca me divyam
907 yo vetti tattvatah
tyaktva dehari punar janma
naiti mam eti so ‘rjuna
“One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and ac-
tivities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this ma-
terial world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.”

The word tattvatah, meaning “in reality,” is very important. Tato
mari tattvato jiatva. Unless one understands Krsna in truth by the
mercy of the spiritual master, one is not free to give up his material
body. As it is said, arukya krcchrena param padari tatah patanty adho


--- Page 256 ---
252 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 15
’nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah: if one neglects to serve the lotus feet of
Krsna, one cannot become free from the material clutches simply by
knowledge. Even if one attains the stage of brahma-padam, merging in
Brahman, without bhakti he is prone to fall down. One must be very
careful in regard to the danger of falling down again into material bon-
dage. The only insurance is to come to the stage of bhakti, from which
one is sure not to fall. Then one is free from the activities of the material
world. In summary, as stated by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, one must get
in touch with a bona fide spiritual master coming in the parampara of
Krsna consciousness, for by his mercy and instructions one is able to get
strength from Krsna. Thus one engages in devotional service and attains
the ultimate goal of life, the lotus feet of Visnu.

Significant in this verse are the words jAanasim acyuta-balah.
Jrianasim, the sword of knowledge, is given by Krsna, and when one
serves the guru and Krsna in order to hold the sword of Krsna’s instruc-
tions, Balarama gives one strength. Balarama is Nityananda. Vrajendra-
nandana 297, Saci-suta haila sei, balarama ha-ila nitai. This bala—
Balarama —comes with Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and both of Them are
so merciful that in this age of Kali one may very easily take shelter of
Their lotus feet. They come especially to deliver the fallen souls of this
age. Papi tapt yata chila, hari-name uddharila. Their weapon is
sankirtana, hari-nama. Thus one should accept the sword of knowledge
from Krsna and be strong with the mercy of Balarama. We are therefore
worshiping Krsna-Balarama in Vrndavana. In the Mundaka Upanisad
(3.2.4) it is said:

nayam atma bala-hinena labhyo
na ca pramadat tapaso vapy alingat
etair updyair yatate yas tu vidvams
tasyaisa atma visate brahma-dhama
One cannot attain the goal of life without the mercy of Balarama. Sri
Narottama dasa Thakura therefore says, nitaiyera karuna habe, vraje
radha-krsna pabe: when one receives the mercy of Balarama,
Nityananda, one can attain the lotus feet of Radha and Krsna very easily.
se sambandha nahi yara, brtha janma gela tara,
vidya-kule hi karibe tara


--- Page 257 ---
Text 46] Instructions for Civilized Human Beings 253
If one has no connection with Nitai, Balarama, then even though one is a
very learned scholar or jAani or has taken birth in a very respectable
family, these assets will not help him. We must therefore conquer the
enemies of Krsna consciousness with the strength received from
Balarama.

Otherwise, if one does not take shelter of Acyuta and Baladeva,

then the senses, acting as the horses, and the intelligence, acting as

tively bring the body, which acts as the chariot, to the path of sense
gratification. When one is thus attracted again by the rogues of

driver are thrown into the blinding dark well of material exis-
tence, and one is again put into a dangerous and extremely fearful
situation of repeated birth and death.
PURPORT
Without the protection of Gaura-Nitai—Krsna and Balarama—one
cannot get out of the dark well of ignorance in material existence. This is
indicated here by the word nocet, which means that one will always
remain in the dark well of material existence. The living entity must get
strength from Nitai-Gaura, or Krsna-Balarama. Without the mercy of
Nitai-Gaura, there is no way to come out of this dark well of ignorance.
As stated in the Caitanya-caritamrta (Adi 1.2):
vande sri-krsna-caitanya-
nityanandau sahoditau
gaudodaye puspavantau
citrau Sandau tamo-nudau
न्न्‌ offer my respectful obeisances unto Sri Krsna Caitanya and Lord
Nityananda, who are like the sun and moon. They have arisen
simultaneously on the horizon of Gauda to dissipate the darkness of ig-
norance and thus wonderfully bestow benediction upon all.”” This ma-
terial world is a dark well of ignorance. The fallen soul in this dark well
must take shelter of the lotus feet of Gaura-Nitai, for thus he can easily
emerge from material existence. Without Their strength, simply at-
tempting to get out of the clutches of matter by speculative knowledge
will be insufficient.

pravrttam—inclination for material enjoyment; ca—and; nivrttam—

TRANSLATION

According to the Vedas, there are two kinds of activities—
pravrtti and nivrtti. Pravrtti activities involve raising oneself from
a lower to a higher condition of materialistic life, whereas nivrtti
means the cessation of material desire. Through pravrtti activities
one suffers from material entanglement, but by nivrtti activities
one is purified and becomes fit to enjoy eternal, blissful life.

PURPORT

As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (16.7), pravrtti ca nivrttim ca jana
na vidur asurah: the asuras, nondevotees, cannot distinguish between
pravrtti and nivrtti. Whatever they like they do. Such persons think
themselves independent of the strong material nature, and therefore
they are irresponsible and do not care to act piously. Indeed, they do not
distinguish between pious and impious activity. Bhakti, of course, does
not depend on pious or impious activity. As stated in Srimad-
Bhagavatam (1.2.6):

sa vai purisam paro dharmo
yato bhaktir adhoksaje
ahaituky apratihata
yayatma suprasidati

“The supreme occupation [dharma] for all humanity is that by which
men can attain to loving devotional service unto the transcendent Lord.
Such devotional service must be unmotivated and uninterrupted in order
to completely satisfy the self.”” Nonetheless, those who act piously have a
better chance to become devotees. As Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita
(7.16), catur-vidha bhajante mari janah sukrtino ’rjuna: “O Arjuna,


--- Page 260 ---
256 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 15
four kinds of pious men render devotional service unto Me.” One who
takes to devotional service, even with some material motive, is con-
sidered pious, and because he has come to Krsna, he will gradually come
to the stage of bhakti. Then, like Dhruva Maharaja, he will refuse to ac-
cept any material benediction from the Lord (svamin krtartho ‘smi
varam na yace). Therefore, even if one is materially inclined, one may
take to the shelter of the lotus feet of Krsna and Balarama, or Gaura and
Nitai, so that he will very soon be purified of all material desires
(ksipram bhavati dharmatma sasvac chantim nigacchati). As soon as one
is freed from inclinations toward pious and impious activities, he be-
comes a perfect candidate for returning home, back to Godhead.

the burning of many valuables, especially food grains, all for the
fulfillment of material desires and the creation of anxiety. Per-
forming such sacrifices, worshiping Vaisvadeva, and performing
the ceremony of Baliharana, which all supposedly constitute the
goal of life, as well as constructing temples for demigods, building
resting houses and gardens, digging wells for the distribution of
water, establishing booths for the distribution of food, and per-
forming activities for public welfare —these are all symptomized
by attachment to material desires.

TRANSLATION
My dear King Yudhisthira, when oblations of ghee and food
grains like barley and sesame are offered in sacrifice, they turn
into celestial smoke, which carries one to successively higher
planetary systems like the kingdoms of Dhuma, Ratri, Krsnapaksa,
Daksinam and ultimately the moon. Then, however, the perfor-
mers of sacrifice descend again to earth to become herbs, creepers,
vegetables and food grains. These are eaten by different living en-
tities and turned to semen, which is injected into female bodies.
Thus one takes birth again and again.

This is explained in Bhagavad-gita (9.21):

the pravrtti-marga, the living entity who desires to be promoted to the
higher planetary systems performs sacrifices regularly, and how he goes
up and comes down again is described here in Srimad-Bhagavatam, as
well as in Bhagavad-gita. It is also said, traigunya-visaya vedah: “The
Vedas deal mainly with the three modes of material nature.” The Vedas,
especially three Vedas, namely Sama, Yajur and Rk, vividly describe this
process of ascending to the higher planets and returning. But Krsna ad-
vises Arjuna, traigunya-visaya veda nistraigunyo bhavarjuna: one has
to transcend these three modes of material nature, and then one will be
released from the cycle of birth and death. Otherwise, although one may
be promoted to a higher planetary system such as Candraloka, one must
again come down (ksine punye martya-lokam visanti). After one’s enjoy-
ment due to pious activities is finished, one must return to this planet in
rainfall and first take birth as a plant or creeper, which is eaten by
various animals, including human beings, and turned to semen. This
semen is injected into the female body, and thus the living entity takes
birth. Those who return to earth in this way take birth especially in
higher families like those of brahmanas.

It may be remarked in this connection that even the modern so-called
scientists who are going to the moon are not able to stay there, but are
returning to their laboratories. Therefore, whether one goes to the moon
by modern mechanical arrangements or by performing pious activities,
one must return to earth. That is clearly stated in this verse and ex-
plained in Bhagavad-gita. Even if one goes to the higher planetary
systems (yanti deva-vrata devan), one’s place there is not secure; one
must return to martya-loka. Abrahma-bhuvanal lokah punar avartino
’rjuna: aside from the moon, even if one goes to Brahmaloka, one must
return. Yar prapya na nivartante tad dhama paramarh mama: but if
one goes back home, back to Godhead, he need not return to this material
world.

semen into the womb of the mother); smasana-antaih—and at death,
when the body is put into a crematorium and burnt to ashes;

TRANSLATION

A twiceborn brahmana [dvija] gains his life by the grace of his
parents through the process of purification known as
garbhadhana. There are also other processes of purification, until
the end of life, when the funeral ceremony [antyesti-kriya] is per-
formed. Thus in due course a qualified brahmana becomes unin-
terested in materialistic activities and sacrifices, but he offers the
sensual sacrifices, in full knowledge, into the working senses,
which are illuminated by the fire of knowledge.

PURPORT

Those interested in materialistic activities remain in the cycle of birth
and death. Pravrtti-marga, or the inclination to stay in the material
world to enjoy varieties of sense gratification, has been explained in the
previous verse. Now, in this verse, it is explained that one who has per-
fect brahminical knowledge rejects the process of elevation to higher
planets and accepts nivrtti-marga; in other words, he prepares himself to
go back home, back to Godhead. Those who are not brahmanas but
atheists do not know what is pravrtti-marga or nivrtti-marga; they
simply want to obtain pleasure at any cost. Our Krsna consciousness
movement is therefore training devotees to give up the pravrtti-marga
and accept the nivrtti-marga in order to return home, back to Godhead.
This is a little difficult to understand, but it is very easy if one takes to
Krsna consciousness seriously and tries to understand Krsna. A Krsna


--- Page 265 ---
Text 53] Instructions for Civilized Human Beings 261
conscious person can understand that performing yajiia according to the
karma-kanda system is a useless waste of time and that merely giving up
the karma-kanda and accepting the process of speculation is also
unfruitful. Therefore Narottama dasa Thakura has sung in his Prema-
bhakti-candrika:
karma-kanda, jiana-kanda, kevala visera bhanda
‘amrta’ baliya yeba khaya
nana yoni sada phire, kadarya bhaksana kare,
tara janma adhah-pate yaya
A life of karma-kanda or jiiana-kanda is like a poison pot, and one who
takes to such a life is doomed. In the karma-kanda system, one is
destined to accept birth and death again and again. Similarly, with jiana-
kanda one falls down again to this material world. Only worship of the
Supreme Person offers one the safety of going back home, back to God-
head.

TRANSLATION

The mind is always agitated by waves of acceptance and rejec-
tion. Therefore all the activities of the senses should be offered
into the mind, which should be offered into one’s words. Then
one’s words should be offered into the aggregate of all alphabets,
which should be offered into the concise form ornkara. Ornkara
should be offered into the point bindu, bindu into the vibration of
sound, and that vibration into the life air. Then the living entity,
who is all that remains, should be placed in Brahman, the
Supreme. This is the process of sacrifice.

PURPORT

The mind is always agitated by acceptance and rejection, which are
compared to mental waves that are constantly tossing. The living entity is
floating in the waves of material existence because of his forgetfulness.
Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura has therefore sung in his Gitavali: miche
mayara vase, yaccha bhese’, khaccha habudubu, bhai. “My dear mind,
under the influence of maya you are being carried away by the waves of
rejection and acceptance. Simply take shelter of Krsna.” Jiva krsna-dasa,
ei viSvdsa, karle ta’ ara duhkha nai: if we simply regard the lotus feet of
Krsna as our ultimate shelter, we shall be saved from all these waves of
maya, which are variously exhibited as mental and sensual activities and
the agitation of rejection and acceptance. Krsna instructs in Bhagavad-
gita (18.66):

sarva-dharman parityajya
mam ekari Saranar vraja
aha tvarh sarva-papebhyo
moksayisyami ma sucah

“Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall
deliver you from all sinful reaction. Do not fear.” Therefore if we simply


--- Page 267 ---
Text 54] Instructions for Civilized Human Beings 263
place ourselves at the lotus feet of Krsna by taking to Krsna conscious-
ness and keeping always in touch with Him by chanting the Hare Krsna
mantra, we need not take much trouble in arranging to return to the
spiritual world. By the mercy of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, this is very
easy.

On his path of ascent, the progressive living entity enters the
different worlds of fire, the sun, the day, the end of the day, the
bright fortnight, the full moon, and the passing of the sun in the
north, along with their presiding demigods. When he enters
Brahmaloka, he enjoys life for many millions of years, and finally

his material designation comes to an end. He then comes to a subtle
designation, from which he attains the causal designation, witness-
ing all previous states. Upon the annihilation of this causal state,
he attains his pure state, in which he identifies with the Supersoul.
In this way the living entity becomes transcendental.

darkness and as light. Thus He, the Supreme Lord, is everything.

PURPORT

Here the Vedic aphorism ৩0707 khalv 10077 brahma is explained. It is
also explained in the catuh-sloki Bhagavatam. Aham evdsam evagre.
The Supreme Lord existed in the beginning, He exists after the creation
and maintains everything, and after destruction everything merges in
Him, as stated in Bhagavad-gita (prakrtirih yanti mamikam). Thus the
Supreme Lord is actually everything. In the conditioned state, we are
bewildered in our understanding, but in the perfect stage of liberation
we can understand that Krsna is the cause of everything.

fection of knowledge.

TRANSLATION

Although one may consider the reflection of the sun from a mir-
ror to be false, it has its factual existence. Accordingly, to prove by
speculative knowledge that there is no reality would be extremely
difficult.

PURPORT

The impersonalists try to prove that the varieties in the vision of the
empiric philosopher are false. The impersonalist philosophy, vivarta-
vada, generally cites the acceptance of a rope to be a snake as an example
of this fact. According to this example, the varieties within our vision are
false, just as a rope seen to be a snake is false. The Vaisnavas say,
however, that although the idea that the rope is a snake is false, the
snake is not false; one has experience of a snake in reality, and therefore
he knows that although the representation of the rope as a snake is false
or illusory, there is a snake in reality. Similarly, this world, which is full
of varieties, is not false; it is a reflection of the reality in the Vaikuntha
world, the spiritual world.

The reflection of the sun from a mirror is nothing but light within
darkness. Thus although it is not exactly sunlight, without the sunlight
the reflection would be impossible. Similarly, the varieties of this world
would be impossible unless there were a real prototype in the spiritual
world. The Mayavadi philosopher cannot understand this, but a real phi-
losopher must be convinced that light is not possible at all without a
background of sunlight. Thus the jugglery of words used by the


--- Page 272 ---
268 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 15
Mayavadi philosopher to prove that this material world is false may
amaze inexperienced children, but a man with full knowledge knows
perfectly well that there cannot be any existence without Krsna.
Therefore a Vaisnava insists on the platform of somehow or other accept-
ing Krsna (tasmat kenapy upayena manah krsne nivesayet).
When we raise our unmixed faith to the lotus feet of Krsna, every-
thing is revealed. Krsna also says in Bhagavad-gita (7.1):
mayy dsakta-mandah partha
yoga yuiijjan mad-asrayah
asams$ayar samagrari mam
yatha jidsyasi tac chrnu
“Now hear, O son of Prtha [Arjuna], how by practicing yoga in full con-
sciousness of Me, with mind attached to Me, you can know Me in full,
free from doubt.” Simply by raising one’s staunch faith in Krsna and His
instructions, one can understand reality without a doubt (asarisayari
samagrari mam). One can understand how Krsna’s material and spiri-
tual energies are working and how He is present everywhere although
everything is not Him. This philosophy of acintya-bhedabheda, incon-
ceivable oneness and difference, is the perfect philosophy enunciated by
the Vaisnavas. Everything is an emanation from Krsna, but it is not that
everything must therefore be worshiped. Speculative knowledge cannot
give us reality as it is, but will continue to be nefariously imperfect. So-
called scientists try to prove that there is no God and that everything is
happening because of the laws of nature, but this is imperfect knowledge
because nothing can work unless directed by the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. This is explained in Bhagavad-gita (9.10) by the Lord Him-
self:
mayadhyaksena prakrtih
siwyate sacaracaram
hetunanena kaunteya
Jagad viparivartate
“This material nature is working under My direction, O son of Kunti,
and it is producing all moving and unmoving beings. By its rule this


--- Page 273 ---
Text 59] Instructions for Civilized Human Beings 269
manifestation is created and annihilated again and again.” In this regard,
Srila Madhvacarya gives this note: durghatatvad arthatvena
paramesvarenaiva kalpitam. The background of everything is the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vasudeva. Vasudevah sarvam iti sa
mahatma sudurlabhah. This can be understood by a mahatma who is
perfect in knowledge. Such a mahatma is rarely seen.

TRANSLATION

In this world there are five elements—namely earth, water, fire,
air and ether —but the body is not a reflection of them, nor a com-
bination or transformation of them. Because the body and its in-
gredients are neither distinct nor amalgamated, all such theories
are insubstantial.

PURPORT

A forest is certainly a transformation of the earth, but one tree does
not depend on another tree; if one is cut down, this does not mean that
the others are cut down. Therefore, the forest is neither a combination
nor a transformation of the trees. The best explanation is given by Krsna
Himself:


--- Page 274 ---
270 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 15
maya tatam idari sarvari
jagad avyakta-miirtina
mat-sthani sarva-bhitani
na caham tesv avasthitah
“By Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded. All
beings are in Me, but I am not in them.” (Bg. 9.4) Everything is an ex-
pansion of Krsna’s energy. As it is said, pardsya Saktir vividhaiva
Srityate: the Lord has multi-energies, which are expressed in different
ways. The energies are existing, and the Supreme Personality of God-
head also exists simultaneously; because everything is His energy, He is
simultaneously one with everything and different from everything. Thus
our speculative theories that atma, the living force, is a combination of
matter, that matter is a transformation of the soul, or that the body is
part of the soul are all insubstantial.

Since all the Lord’s energies are simultaneously existing, one must
understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But although He is
everything, He is not present in everything. The Lord must be worshiped
in His original form as Krsna. He can also present Himself in any one of
His various expanded energies. When we worship the Deity of the Lord
in the temple, the Deity appears to be stone or wood. Now, because the
Supreme Lord does not have a material body, He is not stone or wood, yet
stone and wood are not different from Him. Thus by worshiping stone or
wood we get no result, but when the stone and wood are represented in
the Lord’s original form, by worshiping the Deity we get the desired
result. This is supported by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s philosophy,
acintya-bhedabheda, which explains how the Lord can present Himself
everywhere and anywhere in a form of His energy to accept service from
the devotee.

--- Page 276 ---
272 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 15
regulative principles of the scriptures, consisting of injunctions
and prohibitions, are recommended.

PURPORT

In material existence there are many regulative principles and for-
malities. If material existence is temporary or false, this does not mean
that the spiritual world, although similar, is also false. That one’s ma-
terial body is false or temporary does not mean that the body of the
Supreme Lord is also false or temporary. The spiritual world is real, and
the material world is similar to it. For example, in the desert we some-
times find a mirage, but although the water in a mirage is false, this does
not mean that there is no water in reality; water exists, but not in the
desert. Similarly, nothing real is in this material world, but reality is in
the spiritual world. The Lord’s form and His abode—Goloka Vrndavana
in the Vaikuntha planets—are eternal realities.

From Bhagavad-gita we understand that there is another prakrti, or
nature, which is real. This is explained by the Lord Himself in the Eighth
Chapter of Bhagavad-gita (8.19-21):

bhata-gramah sa evayari

““Again and again the day of Brahma comes, and all living beings are ac-
tive; and again the night falls, O Partha, and they are helplessly dis-
solved. Yet there is another nature, which is eternal and is transcendental


--- Page 277 ---
Text 62] Instructions for Civilized Human Beings 273
to this manifested and unmanifested matter. It is supreme and is never
annihilated. When all in this world is annihilated, that part remains as it
is. That supreme abode is called unmanifested and infallible, and it is the
supreme destination. When one goes there, he never comes back. That is
My supreme abode.” The material world is a reflection of the spiritual
world. The material world is temporary or false, but the spiritual world
is an eternal reality.

After considering the oneness of existence, activity and
paraphernalia and after realizing the self to be different from all
actions and reactions, the mental speculator [muni], according to
his own realization, gives up the three states of wakefulness,
dreaming and sleep.

PURPORT

The three words bhavadvaita, kriyadvaita and dravyadvaita are ex-
plained in the following verses. However, one has to give up all the non-
duality of philosophical life in the material world and come to the actual
life of reality in the spiritual world in order to attain perfection.

When one understands that result and cause are one and that
duality is ultimately unreal, like the idea that the threads of a cloth
are different from the cloth itself, one reaches the conception of
oneness called bhavadvaita.

TRANSLATION
My dear Yudhisthira [Partha], when all the activities one per-
forms with his mind, words and body are dedicated directly to the
service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one reaches one-
ness of activities, called kriyadvaita.
PURPORT
The Krsna consciousness movement is teaching people how to come to
the stage of dedicating everything to the service of the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead. Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (9.27):
yat karosi yad asnasi
yaj juhosi dadasi yat
yat tapasyasi kaunteya
tat kurusva mad-arpanam
0 son of Kunti, all that you do, all that you eat, all that you offer and
give away, as well as all austerities that you may perform, should be done
as an offering unto Me.” If whatever we do, whatever we eat, whatever
we think and whatever we plan is for the advancement of the Krsna con-
sciousness movement, this is oneness. There is no difference between
chanting for Krsna consciousness and working for Krsna consciousness.
On the transcendental platform, they are one. But we must be guided by
the spiritual master about this oneness; we should not manufacture our
own oneness.

TRANSLATION
‘When the ultimate goal and interest of one’s self, one’s wife,
one’s children, one’s relatives and all other embodied living
beings is one, this is called dravyadvaita, or oneness of interest.
PURPORT
The actual interest of all living entities—indeed, the goal of life—is to
return home, back to Godhead. This is the interest of one’s own self,
one’s wife, one’s children, one’s disciples and one’s friends, relatives,
countrymen and all humanity. The Krsna consciousness movement can
give directions for management by which everyone can partake in Krsna
conscious activities and reach the ultimate goal, which is known as
svartha-gatim. This objective of everyone’s interest is Visnu, but because
people do not know this (na te viduh svartha-gatiri hi visnum), they are
making various plans by which to fulfill so many concocted interests in
life. The Krsna consciousness movement is trying to bring everyone to
the highest interest. The process may be differently named, but if the
aim is one, people should follow it to achieve the ultimate goal in life.
Unfortunately, people are thinking of different interests, and blind
leaders are misleading them. Everyone is trying to reach the goal of com-
plete happiness materially; because people do not know what complete
happiness is, they are materially diverted toward different interests.

In normal conditions, in the absence of danger, O King
Yudhisthira, a man should perform his prescribed activities ac-
cording to his status of life with the things, endeavors, process and
living place that are not forbidden for him, and not by any other
means.
PURPORT
This instruction is given for men in all statuses of life. Generally
society is divided into brahmanas, ksatriyas, wvaiSyas, Sudras,
brahmacaris, vanaprasthas, sannyasis and grhasthas. Everyone must act
according to his position and try to please the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, for that will make one’s life successful. This was instructed in
Naimisaranya:
atah pumbhir dvija-srestha
varnasrama-vibhagasah
svanusthitasya dharmasya
sarnsiddhir hari-tosanam
“‘O best among the twiceborn, it is therefore concluded that the highest
perfection one can achieve, by discharging his prescribed duties
[dharmal according to caste divisions and order of life, is to please the
Lord Hari.” (Bhag. 1.2.13) Everyone should act according to his occupa-
tional duties just to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then
everyone will be happy.

O King, one should perform his occupational duties according
to these instructions, as well as other instructions given in the
Vedic literature, just to remain a devotee of Lord Krsna. Thus,
even while at home, one will be able to reach the destination.
PURPORT
The ultimate goal of life is Visnu, Krsna. Therefore, either by Vedic
regulative principles or by materialistic activities, if one tries to reach the
destination of Krsna, that is the perfection of life. Krsna should be the
target; everyone should try to reach Krsna, from any position of life.
Krsna accepts service from anyone. The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita
(9.32):
marn hi partha vyapasritya
ye ’pi syuh pdpa-yonayah
striyo vaiSyds tatha sudras
te ’pi yanti param gatim
“0 son of Prtha, those who take shelter in Me, though they be of lower
birth—women, vaisyas [merchants], as well as sidras [workers] —can
approach the supreme destination.” It does not matter what one’s posi-
tion is; if one aims at reaching Krsna by performing his occupational
duty under the direction of the spiritual master, his life is successful. It
is not that only sannyasis, vanaprasthas and brahmacdris can reach


--- Page 283 ---
Text 68] Instructions for Civilized Human Beings 279
Krsna. A grhastha, a householder, can also reach Krsna, provided he be-
comes a pure devotee without material desires. An example of this is
cited in the next verse.

O King Yudhisthira, because of your service to the Supreme
Lord, all of you Pandavas defeated the greatest dangers posed by
numerous kings and demigods. By serving the lotus feet of Krsna,
you conquered great enemies, who were like elephants, and thus
you collected ingredients for sacrifice. By His grace, may you be
delivered from material involvement.
PURPORT
Placing himself as an ordinary householder, Maharaja Yudhisthira in-
quired from Narada Muni how a grha-midha-dhi, a person who 15 en-
tangled in household life and who thus continues to remain a fool, can be

delivered. Narada Muni encouraged Maharaja Yudhisthira by saying,
“You are already on the safe side because you, along with your entire
family, have become a pure devotee of Krsna.” By Krsna’s grace, the
Pandavas conquered in the Battle of Kuruksetra and were saved from
many dangers posed not only by kings but sometimes even by the
demigods. Thus they are a practical example of how to live in security
and safety by the grace of Krsna. Everyone should follow the example of
the Pandavas, who showed how to be saved by the grace of Krsna. Our
Krsna consciousness movement is intended to teach how everyone can
live peacefully in this material world and at the end of life return home,
back to Godhead. In the material world there are always dangers at every
step (pada padari yad vipadari na tesam). Nonetheless, if one takes
shelter of Krsna without hesitation and keeps under the shelter of Krsna,
he can easily cross the ocean of nescience. Samadsrita ye pada-pallava-
plavari mahat-padari punya-yaso murareh. To the devotee, this great
ocean of nescience becomes like a puddle of water in the hoofprint of a
cow. A pure devotee, without embarrassing himself by trying for eleva-
tion in so many ways, stays in the safest position as a servant of Krsna,
and thus his life is eternally safe without a doubt.

TRANSLATION
Long, long ago, in another maha-kalpa [millennium of Brahma),
I existed as the Gandharva known as Upabarhana. I was very re-
spected by the other Gandharvas.
PURPORT
Srila Narada Muni is giving a practical example from his past life. For-
merly, during the previous lifetime of Lord Brahma, Narada Muni was
one of the denizens of Gandharvaloka, but unfortunately, as will be ex-
plained, he fell from his exalted position in Gandharvaloka, where the
inhabitants are extremely beautiful and expert in singing, to become a
siidra. Nonetheless, because of his association with devotees, he became
more fortunate than he was in Gandharvaloka. Even though cursed by
the prajapatis to become a Sidra, in his next life he became the son of
Lord Brahma. A
The word maha-kalpe is described by Srila Madhvacarya as atita-
brahma-kalpe. Brahma dies at the end of a life of many millions of years.
The day of Brahma is described in Bhagavad-gita (8.17):
sahasra-yuga-paryantam
ahar yad brahmano viduh
ratrim yuga-sahasrantar
te ’ho-ratra-vido janah
“By human calculation, a thousand ages taken together is the duration of
Brahma’s one day. And such also is the duration of his night.” Bhagavan
Sri Krsna can remember incidents from millions of years ago. Similarly,
His pure devotee like Narada Muni can also remember incidents from a
past life millions and millions of years ago.

TRANSLATION

I had a beautiful face and a pleasing, attractive bodily structure.
Decorated with flower garlands and sandalwood pulp, I was most
pleasing to the women of my city. Thus I was bewildered, always
feeling lusty desires.

PURPORT

From the description of the beauty of Narada Muni when he was one
of the denizens of Gandharvaloka, it appears that everyone on that planet
is extremely beautiful and pleasing and always decorated with flowers
and sandalwood. Upabarhana was Narada Muni’s name previously.
Upabarhana was specifically expert in decorating himself to attract the
attention of women, and thus he became a playboy, as described in the
next verse. To be a playboy in this life is unfortunate because too much
attraction to women will lead one to fall into the association of $00705,
who can easily take advantage of mingling with women without restric-
tion. In this present age of Kali, when people are mandah sumanda-
matayah—very bad because of a Sidra mentality —such free mingling is
prominent. Among the higher classes—brahmana, ksatriya and
vaiSya—there is no chance for men to mingle with women freely, but in
the $0070 community such mingling is open. Because there is no cultural
education in this age of Kali, everyone is spiritually untrained, and
everyone is therefore to be considered sudra (asuddhah sudra-kalpa hi
brahmanah kali-sambhavah). When all the people become sidras, cer-
tainly they are very bad (mandah sumanda-matayah). Thus they
manufacture their own way of life, with the result that they gradually

Text 71] Instructions for Civilized Human Beings 283
become unfortunate (manda-bhagyah), and furthermore they are al-
ways disturbed by various circumstances.

TRANSLATION

Once there was a sainkirtana festival to glorify the Supreme Lord
in an assembly of the demigods, and the Gandharvas and Apsaras
were invited by the prajapatis to take part in it.

PURPORT

Sarikirtana means chanting of the holy name of the Lord. The Hare
Krsna movement is not a new movement as people sometimes mistakenly
think. The Hare Krsna movement is present in every millennium of Lord
Brahma’s life, and the holy name is chanted in all the higher planetary
systems, including Brahmaloka and Candraloka, not to speak of
Gandharvaloka and Apsaroloka. The sasikirtana movement that was
started in this world five hundred years ago by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu
is therefore not a new movement. Sometimes, because of our bad luck,
this movement is stopped, but Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and His servants
again start the movement for the benefit of the entire word or, indeed,
the entire universe.

TRANSLATION
Narada Muni continued: Being invited to that festival, I also
joined, and, surrounded by women, I began musically singing the
glories of the demigods. Because of this, the prajapatis, the great
demigods in charge of the affairs of the universe, forcefully
cursed me with these words: “Because you have committed an
offense, may you immediately become a $iidra, devoid of beauty.”
PURPORT
As far as kirtana is concerned, the $astras say, Sravanarm kirtanar
visnoh: one should chant the glories of the Supreme Lord and the holy
name of the Supreme Lord. This is clearly stated. Sravanam kirtanari


--- Page 289 ---
Text 73] Instructions for Civilized Human Beings 285
visnoh: one should chant about and glorify Lord Visnu, not any demigod.
Unfortunately, there are foolish persons who invent some process of
kirtana on the basis of a demigod’s name. This is an offense. Kirtana
means glorifying the Supreme Lord, not any demigod. Sometimes people
invent Kali-kirtana or Siva-kirtana, and even big sannydsis in the
Mayavada school say that one may chant any name and still get the same
result. But here we find that millions and millions of years ago, when
Narada Muni was a Gandharva, he neglected the order to glorify the
Lord, and being mad in the association of women, he began to chant
otherwise. Thus he was cursed to become a Sidra. His first offense was
that he went to join the sarikirtana party in the company of lusty women,
and another offense was that he considered ordinary songs, like cinema
songs and other such songs, to be equal to sarikirtana. For this offense he
was punished with becoming a Sidra.

PURPORT
The Supreme Personality of Godhead says in Bhagavad-gita (9.32):
mar hi partha vyapasritya
ye 08 syuh papa-yonayah
striyo vaiSyas tatha sudrdas
te 08 yanti parari gatiri
“O son of Prtha, those who take shelter in Me, though they be of lower
birth — women, vaisyas [merchants], as well as sidras [workers] —can
approach the supreme destination.” It doesn’t matter whether a person 18
born as a Sidra, a woman or a vaisya; if he associates with devotees
repeatedly or always (sadhu-sarigena), he can be elevated to the highest
perfection. Narada Muni is explaining this in relation to his own life. The
sarikirtana movement is important, for regardless of whether one is a
चरकाय, vaiSya, mleccha, yavana or whatever, if one associates with a
pure devotee, follows his instructions and serves the pure devotee, his
life is successful. This is bhakti. Anukilyena krsnanusilanam. Bhakti
consists of serving Krsna and His devotees very favorably.
Anyabhilasita-sinyam. If one has no desire other than to serve Krsna
and His devotee, then his life is successful. This is explained by Narada
Muni through this practical example from his own life.

The process of chanting the holy name of the Lord is so power-
ful that by this chanting even householders [grhasthas] can very
easily gain the ultimate result achieved by persons in the
renounced order. Maharaja Yudhisthira, I have now explained to
you that process of religion.
PURPORT
This is a confirmation of the Krsna consciousness movement. Anyone
who takes part in this movement, regardless of what he is, can gain the
topmost result achieved by a perfect sannyasi, namely brahma-jidana
(spiritual knowledge). Even more important, he can advance in devo-
tional service. Maharaja Yudhisthira thought that because he was a
grhastha there was no hope of his being liberated, and therefore he
asked Narada Muni how he could get out of material entanglement. But
Narada Muni, citing a practical example from his own life, established
that by associating with devotees and chanting the Hare Krsna mantra,
any man in any condition of life can achieve the highest perfection with-
out a doubt.

the planets of the universe, come to your house just like ordinary
visitors. Furthermore, the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Krsna, is living confidentially with you in your house, just like
your brother.
PURPORT
Here is a statement exalting a Vaispava. In human society, a
brahmana is the most respected person. A brahmana is one who can
understand Brahman, the impersonal Brahman, but hardly ever can one
understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is described by
Arjuna in Bhagavad-gita as param brahma. A brahmana may be ex-
tremely fortunate in having achieved brahma-jiidna, but the Pandavas
were so exalted that the Parabrahman, the Supreme Personality of God-
head, was living in their house like an ordinary human being. The word
bhitri-bhagah indicates that the Pandavas were in a still higher position
than brahmacaris and brahmanas. In the following verses, Narada Muni
repeatedly glorifies the position of the Pandavas.

the Parabrahman, Krsna, who is sought by great, great sages for
the sake of liberation and transcendental bliss, is acting as your
best well-wisher, your friend, your cousin, your heart and soul,
your worshipable director, and your spiritual master.
PURPORT
Krsna can become the director and spiritual master of anyone who is
serious about getting the mercy of Krsna. The Lord sends the spiritual
master to train a devotee, and when the devotee is advanced, the Lord
acts as the spiritual master within his heart.

“To those who are constantly devoted and worhip Me with love, I give
the understanding by which they can come to Me.”” Krsna does not be-
come the direct spiritual master unless one is fully trained by His repre-
sentative spiritual master. Therefore, as we have already discussed, the
Lord’s representative spiritual master should not be considered an ordi-
nary human being. The representative spiritual master never gives any
false knowledge to his disciple, but only perfect knowledge. Thus he is
the representative of Krsna. Krsna helps as the guru, or spiritual master,
from within and from without. From without He helps the devotee as His

representative, and from within He talks personally with the pure devo-
tee and gives him instructions by which he may return home, back to
Godhead.

TRANSLATION
Present here now is the same Supreme Personality of Godhead
whose true form cannot be understood even by such great per-
sonalities as Lord Brahma and Lord Siva. He is realized by devotees
because of their unflinching surrender. May that same Personality
of Godhead, who is the maintainer of His devotees and who is
worshiped by silence, by devotional service and by cessation of ma-
terial activities, be pleased with us.
PURPORT
Lord Krsna is not properly understood even by such exalted per-
sonalities as Lord Siva and Lord Brahma, what to speak of ordinary men,


--- Page 295 ---
Text 78] Instructions for Civilized Human Beings 291
but by His causeless mercy He bestows the benediction of devotion upon
His devotees, who can thus understand Krsna as He is. Bhaktya mam
abhijanati yavan yas casmi tattvatah. No one within this universe can
understand Krsna in truth, but if one engages in devotional service one
can understand Him perfectly well. This is also confirmed by the Lord in
the Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-gita (7.1):
mayy asakta-manah partha
yogarh yuijan mad-asrayah
asamsayam samagrar mar

yatha jRasyasi tac chrnu
“Now, hear, 0 son of Prtha [Arjuna], how by practicing yoga in full
consciousness of Me, with mind attached to Me, you can know Me in full,
free from doubt.” Lord Krsna Himself teaches how one can understand
Him perfectly well, without a doubt. Not only the Pandavas but everyone
who sincerely accepts the instructions of Krsna can understand the
Supreme Personality of Godhead as He is. After instructing Yudhisthira
Maharaja, Narada Muni prays for the Lord’s blessings that He be pleased
with everyone and that everyone become perfect in God consciousness
and return home, back to Godhead.

Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said: Maharaja Yudhisthira, the best
member of the Bharata dynasty, thus learned everything from the
descriptions of Narada Muni. After hearing these instructions, he
felt great pleasure from within his heart, and in great ecstasy, love
and affection, he worshiped Lord Krsna.

PURPORT

It is natural that when someone belonging to one’s family circle is
understood to be very great, one becomes ecstatic in love, thinking, “Oh,
such a great personality is our relative!” When Sri Krsna, who was
already known to the Pandavas, was further described by Narada Muni
to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead, naturally the Pandavas were
amazed, thinking, “The Supreme Personality of Godhead is with us as
our cousin!” Certainly their ecstasy was extraordinary.

TRANSLATION

Narada Muni, being worshiped by Krsna and Maharaja
Yudhisthira, bade them farewell and went away. Yudhisthira
Maharaja, having heard that Krsna, his cousin, is the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead, was struck with wonder.

PURPORT

After hearing the conversation between Narada and Yudhisthira, if
one still has any doubts about Krsna’s being the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, one should immediately give them up. Asamsayarh samagram.
Without any doubt and without any defect, one should understand Krsna
to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus surrender at His
lotus feet. Ordinary persons do not do this, even after hearing all the
Vedas, but if one is fortunate, although it may be even after many, many
births, he comes to this conclusion (bahiinar janmanam ante jianavan
mar prapadyate).

The Author

His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada appeared in
this world in 1896 in Calcutta, India. He first met his spiritual master,
Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami, in Calcutta in 1922. Bhakti-
siddhanta Sarasvati, a prominent devotional scholar and the founder of
sixty-four Gaudiya Mathas (Vedic institutes), liked this educated young
man and convinced him to dedicate his life to teaching Vedic knowledge.
Srila Prabhupada became his student, and eleven years later (1933) at
Allahabad he became his formally initiated disciple.

At their first meeting, in 1922, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati
Thakura requested Srila Prabhupada to broadcast Vedic knowledge
through the English language. In the years that followed, Srila Prabhu-
pada wrote a commentary on the Bhagavad-gita, assisted the Gaudiya
Matha in its work and, in 1944, without assistance, started an English
fortnightly magazine, edited it, typed the manuscripts and checked the
galley proofs. He even distributed the individual copies freely and strug-
gled to maintain the publication. Once begun, the magazine never
stopped; it is now being continued by his disciples in the West.

Recognizing Srila Prabhupada’s philosophical learning and devotion,
the Gaudiya Vaisnava Society honored him in 1947 with the title
“Bhaktivedanta.” In 1950, at the age of fifty-four, Srila Prabhupada
retired from married life, and four years later he adopted the
vanaprastha (retired) order to devote more time to his studies and writ-
ing. Srila Prabhupada traveled to the holy city of Vrndavana, where he
lived in very humble circumstances in the historic medieval temple of
Radha-Dameodara. There he engaged for several years in deep study and
writing. He accepted the renounced order of life (sannyasa) in 1959. At
Radha-Damodara, Srila Prabhupada began work on his life’s master-
piece: a multivolume translation and commentary on the eighteen thou-
sand verse Srimad-Bhagavatam (Bhagavata Purana). He also wrote
Easy Journey to Other Planets. y

After publishing three volumes of Bhagavatam, Srila Prabhupada
came to the United States, in 1965, to fulfill the mission of his spiritual
master. Since that time, His Divine Grace has written over forty volumes
of authoritative translations, commentaries and summary studies of the
philosophical and religious classics of India.

298 Srimad-Bhagavatam

In 1965, when he first arrived by freighter in New York City, Srila
Prabhupada was practically penniless. It was after almost a year of great
difficulty that he established the International Society for Krishna Con-
sciousness in July of 1966. Under his careful guidance, the Society has
grown within a decade to a worldwide confederation of almost one
hundred asramas, schools, temples, institutes and farm communities.

In 1968, Srila Prabhupada created New Vrndavana, an experimental
Vedic community in the hills of West Virginia. Inspired by the success of
New Vrndavana, now a thriving farm community of more than one thou-
sand acres, his students have since founded several similar communities
in the United States and abroad.

In 1972, His Divine Grace introduced the Vedic system of primary and
secondary education in the West by founding the Gurukula school in
Dallas, Texas. The school began with 3 children in 1972, and by the
beginning of 1975 the enrollment had grown to 150.

Srila Prabhupada has also inspired the construction of a large inter-
national center at Sridhama Mayapur in West Bengal, India, which is also
the site for a planned Institute of Vedic Studies. A similar project is the
magnificent Krsna-Balaraima Temple and International Guest House in
Vrndavana, India. These are centers where Westerners can live to gain
firsthand experience of Vedic culture.

Srila Prabhupada’s most significant contribution, however, is his
books. Highly respected by the academic community for their authori-
tativeness, depth and clarity, they are used as standard textbooks in
numerous college courses. His writings have been translated into eleven
languages. The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, established in 1972 ex-
clusively to publish the works of His Divine Grace, has thus become the
world’s largest publisher of books in the field of Indian religion and phi-
losophy. Its latest project is the publishing of Srila Prabhupada’s most
recent work: a seventeen-volume translation and commentary —com-
pleted by Srila Prabhupada in only eighteen months—on the Bengali
religious classic Sri Caitanya-caritamrta.

In the past ten years, in spite of his advanced age, Srila Prabhupada
has circled the globe twelve times on lecture tours that have taken him to
six continents. In spite of such a vigorous schedule, Srila Prabhupada
continues to write prolifically. His writings constitute a veritable library
of Vedic philosophy, religion, literature and culture.

BHAGAVATAM

Srimad-Bhagavatam, an epic philosophical and
literary classic, holds a prominent position in
India’s voluminous written wisdom. The timeless
wisdom of India is expressed in the Vedas, ancient
Sanskrit texts that touch upon all fields of human
knowledge. Originally preserved through oral tradi-
tion, the Vedas were first put into writing by Srila
Vyisadeva, the “literary incarnation of God.” After |
compiling the Vedas, Srila Vyasadeva was inspired
by his spiritual master to present their profound
essence in the form of Srimad-Bhagavatam. Known
as “the ripened fruit of the tree of Vedic literature,”
Srimad-Bhagavatam is the most complete and au- i
thoritative exposition of Vedic knowledge.

After writing the Bhagavatam, Vyasa taught it to
his son, Sukadeva Gosvami, who later spoke the
Bhagavatam to Maharaja Pariksit in an assembly of
sages on the bank of the sacred Ganges River. Al-
though Maharaja Pariksit was a great rajarsi (saintly
king) and the emperor of the world, when he
received notice of his death seven days in advance, he |
renounced his entire kindgom and retired to the
bank of the Ganges to seek spiritual enlightenment. |
The questions of King Pariksit and Sukadeva |
Gosvami’s illuminating answers, concerning every- |
thing from the nature of the self to the origin of the
universe, are the basis of Srimad-Bhagavatam.

This edition of Bhagavatam is the only complete
English translation with an elaborate and scholarly
commentary, and it is the first edition widely avail-
able to the English-reading public. This work is the
product of the scholarly and devotional effort of His
Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhu- ४
pada. the world’s most distinguished teacher of
Indian religious and philosophical thought. His
Sanskrit scholarship and intimate familiarity with
Vedic culture combine to reveal to the West a mag- ১
nificent exposition of this important classic.

With its comprehensive system of providing the
original Sanskrit text, Roman transliteration, precise
word-for-word equivalents, a lucid English transla- 4
tion and a comprehensive commentary, it will appeal ;
to scholars, students and laymen alike. The entire
multivolume text, presented by the Bhaktivedanta
Book Trust, promises to occupy a significant place in
the intellectual, cultural and spiritual life of modern ¢
man for a long time to come. |

! What the reviewers say about the Srimad-
Bhagavatam, by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhakti-
vedanta Swami Prabhupada:

“It has been my great pleasure recently to have
read the Srimad-Bhagavatam in the superb edition
authorized by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhu-
pada. I am sure this monumental work will go far to
bring the sublime message of the Bhagavatam to
numerous Westerners who otherwise would miss this
opportunity.”

Dr. Alex Wayman
Professor of Sanskrit
Columbia University

“‘Srimad-Bhagavatam is a valuable source ma-
terial for several categories of readers. With its ex-
haustive plan of providing the original Sanskrit text,
its. Roman transliteration, English synonyms,
English translation and elaborate commentary by a
scholar and practitioner of philosophy, it cannot but
be attractive to serious students and scholars of
religion and philosophy. I recommend this series to
anyone as an important and useful reference work.”

Professor C. P. Agrawal
Chairman

Department of Humanities
University of Michigan

“The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust editions of
famous religious classics of India with new transla-
tions and commentaries are an important addition to
our expanding knowledge of spiritual India. The new
edition of the Srimad-Bhagavatam is particularly
welcome.” 1
