Preface

We must know the present need of human society. And what is that
need? Human society is no longer bounded by geographical limits to par-
ticular countries or communities. Human society is broader than in the
Middle Ages, and the world tendency is toward one state or one human
society. The ideals of spiritual communism, according to Srimad-
Bhagavatam, are based more or less on the oneness of the entire human
society, nay, of the entire energy of living beings. The need is felt by
great thinkers to make this a successful ideology. Srimad-Bhagavatam
will fill this need in human society. It begins, therefore, with the apho-
rism of Vedanta philosophy janmady asya yatah to establish the ideal of
a common cause.

Human society, at the present moment, is not in the darkness of
oblivion. It has made rapid progress in the field of material comforts,
education and economic development throughout the entire world. But
there is a pinprick somewhere in the social body at large, and therefore
there are large-scale quarrels, even over less important issues. There is
need of a clue as to how humanity can become one in peace, friendship
and prosperity with a common cause. Srimad-Bhagavatam will fill this
need, for it is a cultural presentation for the re-spiritualization of the
entire human society.

Srimad-Bhagavatam should be introduced also in the schools and col-
leges, for it is recommended by the great student-devotee Prahlada
Maharaja in order to change the demoniac face of society.

Disparity in human society is due to lack of principles in a godless
civilization. There is God, or the Almighty One, from whom everything
emanates, by whom everything is maintained and in whom everything

is merged to rest. Material science has tried to find the ultimate source
of creation very insufficiently, but it is a fact that there is one ulti-
mate source of everything that be. This ultimate source is explained
rationally and authoritatively in the beautiful Bhagavatam or Srimad-
Bhagavatam.

Srimad-Bhagavatam is the transcendental science not only for know-
ing the ultimate source of everything but also for knowing our relation
with Him and our duty towards perfection of the human society on the
basis of this perfect knowledge. It is powerful reading matter in the
Sanskrit language, and it is now rendered into English elaborately so that
simply by a careful reading one will know God perfectly well, so much so
that the reader will be sufficiently educated to defend himself from the
onslaught of atheists. Over and above this, the reader will be able to con-
vert others to accepting God as a concrete principle.

Srimad-Bhagavatam begins with the definition of the ultimate source.
It is a bona fide commentary on the Vedanta-sitra by the same author,
Srila Vyasadeva, and gradually it develops into nine cantos up to the
highest state of God realization. The only qualification one needs to study
this great book of transcendental knowledge is to proceed step by step
cautiously and not jump forward haphazardly like with an ordinary
book. It should be gone through chapter by chapter, one after another.
The reading matter is so arranged with its original Sanskrit text, its
English transliteration, synonyms, translation and purports so that one is
sure to become a God-realized soul at the end of finishing the first nine
cantos.

The Tenth Canto is distinct from the first nine cantos because it deals
directly with the transcendental activities of the Personality of Godhead
Sri Krsna. One will be unable to capture the effects of the Tenth Canto
without going through the first nine cantos. The book is complete in
twelve cantos, each independent, but it is good for all to read them in
small installments one after another. J

I must admit my frailties in presenting Srimad-Bhagavatam, but still
I am hopeful of its good reception by the thinkers and leaders of society
ट he strength of the following statement of Srimad-Bhagavatam

1.5.11):
tad-vag-visargo janatagha-viplavo
yasmin prati-slokam abaddhavaty api

“On the other hand, that literature which is full with descriptions of the
transcendental glories of the name, fame, form and pastimes of the un-
limited Supreme Lord is a transcendental creation meant to bring about a
revolution in the impious life of a misdirected civilization. Such tran-
scendental literatures, even though irregularly composed, are heard,

sung and accepted by purified men who are thoroughly honest.”

Introduction

“This Bhagavata Purana is as brilliant as the sun, and it has arisen
just after the departure of Lord Krsna to His own abode, accompanied by
religion, knowledge, etc. Persons who have lost their vision due to the
dense darkness of ignorance in the age of Kali shall get light from this
Purana.” (Srimad-Bhagavatam 1.3.43)

The timeless wisdom of India is expressed in the Vedas, ancient
Sanskrit texts that touch upon all fields of human knowledge. Originally
preserved through oral tradition, the Vedas were first put into writing
five thousand years ago by Srila Vyasadeva, the “literary incarnation of
God.” After compiling the Vedas, Vyasadeva set forth their essence in
the aphorisms known as Vedanta-sitras. Srimad-Bhagavatam is
Vyasadeva’s commentary on his own Vedanta-sitras. It was written in
the maturity of his spiritual life under the direction of Narada Muni, his
spiritual master. Referred to as “the ripened fruit of the tree of Vedic
literature,” Srimad-Bhagavatam is the most complete and authoritative
exposition of Vedic knowledge.

After compiling the Bhagavatam, Vyasa impressed the synopsis of it
upon his son, the sage Sukadeva Gosvami. Sukadeva Gosvami subse-
quently recited the entire Bhagavatam to Maharaja Pariksit in an assem-
bly of learned saints on the bank of the Ganges at Hastinapura (now
Delhi). Maharaja Pariksit was the emperor of the world and was a great
rajarsi (saintly king). Having received a warning that he would die
within a week, he renounced his entire kingdom and retired to the bank
of the Ganges to fast until death and receive spiritual enlightenment.
The Bhagavatam begins with Emperor Pariksit’s sober inquiry to
Sukadeva Gosvami: “You are the spiritual master of great saints and
devotees. I am therefore begging you to show the way of perfection for
all persons, and especially for one who is about to die. Please let me know
what a man should hear, chant, remember and worship, and also what he
should not do. Please explain all this to me.”

Sukadeva Gosvami’s answer to this question, and numerous other
questions posed by Maharaja Pariksit, concerning everything from the
nature of the self to the origin of the universe, held the assembled sages

xiii


--- Page 5 ---
xiv Srimad-Bhagavatam

in rapt attention continuously for the seven days leading to the King’s
death. The sage Sata Gosvami, who was present on the bank of the
Ganges when § kadova Gosvami first recited Srimad-Bhagavatam, later
repeated the Bhagavatam before a gathering of sages in the forest of
Naimisaranya. Those sages, concerned about the spiritual welfare of the
people in general, had gathered to perform a long, continuous chain of
sacrifices to counteract the degrading influence of the incipient age of
Kali. In response to the sages’ request that he speak the essence of Vedic
wisdom, Sita Gosvami repeated from memory the entire eighteen thou-
sand verses of Srimad-Bhagavatam, as spoken by Sukadeva Gosvami to
Maharaja Pariksit.

The reader of Srimad-Bhagavatam hears Sita Gosvami relate the
questions of Maharaja Pariksit and the answers of Sukadeva Gosvami.
Also, Sita Gosvami sometimes responds directly to questions put by
Saunaka Rsi, the spokesman for the sages gathered at Naimisaranya. One
therefore simultaneously hears two dialogues: one between Maharaja
Pariksit and Sukadeva Gosvimi on the bank of the Ganges, and another
at Naimisaranya between Sita Gosvami and the sages at Naimisaranya
Forest, headed by Saunaka Rsi. Furthermore, while instructing King
Pariksit, Sukadeva Gosvami often relates historical episodes and gives
accounts of lengthy philosophical discussions between such great souls as
the saint Maitreya and his disciple Vidura. With this understanding of
the history of the Bhagavatam, the reader will easily be able to follow its
intermingling of dialogues and events from various sources. Since philo-
sophical wisdom, not chronological order, is most important in the text,
one need only be attentive to the subject matter of Srimad-Bhagavatam
to appreciate fully its profound message.

The translator of this edition compares the Bhagavatam to sugar
candy —wherever you taste it, you will find it equally sweet and
relishable. Therefore, to taste the sweetness of the Bhagavatam, one may
begin by reading any of its volumes. After such an introductory taste,
however, the serious reader is best advised to go back to Volume One of
the First Canto and then proceed through the Bhagavatam, volume after
volume, in its natural order.

This edition of the Bhagavatam is the first complete English transla-
tion of this important text with an elaborate commentary, and it is the
first widely available to the English-speaking public. It is the product of

Introduction xv
the scholarly and devotional effort of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhakti-
vedanta Swami Prabhupada, the world’s most distinguished teacher of
Indian religious and philosophical thought. His consummate Sanskrit
scholarship and intimate familiarity with Vedic culture and thought as
well as the modern way of life combine to reveal to the West a magnifi-
cent exposition of this important classic.

Readers will find this work of value for many reasons. For those in-
terested in the classical roots of Indian civilization, it serves as a vast
reservoir of detailed information on virtually every one of its aspects.
For students of comparative philosophy and religion, the Bhagavatam
offers a penetrating view into the meaning of India’s profound spiritual
heritage. To sociologists and anthropologists, the Bhagavatam reveals the
practical workings of a peaceful and scientifically organized Vedic
culture, whose institutions were integrated on the basis of a highly
developed spiritual world view. Students of literature will discover the
Bhagavatam to be a masterpiece of majestic poetry. For students of psy-
chology, the text provides important perspectives on the nature of con-
sciousness, human behavior and the philosophical study of identity.
Finally, to those seeking spiritual insight, the Bhagavatam offers simple
and practical guidance for attainment of the highest self-knowledge and
realization of the Absolute Truth. The entire multivolume text, pre-
sented by the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, promises to occupy a significant
place in the intellectual, cultural and spiritual life of modern man for a
long time to come.

CHAPTER SIX
The Killing of the Demon Piitana
A summary of the Sixth Chapter is as follows: when Nanda Maharaja,
following the instructions of Vasudeva, was returning home, he saw a
great demoniac woman lying on the road, and then he heard about her
death.

While Nanda Maharaja, the King of Vraja, was thinking about
Vasudeva’s words concerning disturbances in Gokula, he was a little
afraid and sought shelter at the lotus feet of Sri Hari. Meanwhile, Karisa
sent to the village of Gokula a Raksasi named Patana, who was wander-
ing here and there killing small babies. Of course, wherever there is no
Krsna consciousness, there is the danger of such Raksasis, but since the
Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself was in Gokula, Pitana could
accept nothing there but her own death.

One day, Patana arrived from outer space in Gokula, the home of
Nanda Maharaja, and by displaying her mystic power, she assumed the
disguise of a very beautiful woman. Taking courage, she immediately
entered Krsna’s bedroom without anyone’s permission; by the grace of
Krsna, no one forbade her to enter the house or the room, because that
was Krsna’s desire. The baby Krsna, who resembled a fire covered by
ashes, looked upon Piitana and thought that He would have to kill this
demon, the beautiful woman. Enchanted by the influence of yogamaya
and the Personality of Godhead, Patana took Krsna upon her lap, and
neither Rohini nor 36008 objected. The demon Pitana offered her
breast for Krsna to suck, but her breast was smeared with poison. The
child Krsna, therefore, squeezed Pitana’s breast so severely that in un-
bearable pain she had to assume her original body and fell to the ground.
Then Krsna began playing on her breast just like a small child. When
Krsna was playing, the gopis were pacified and took the child away to
their own laps. After this incident, the gopis took precautions because of
the attack of the Raksasi. Mother Yasoda gave the child her breast to suck
and then laid Him in bed.

2 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 10, Ch. 6
Meanwhile, Nanda and his associates the cowherd men returned from
Mathura, and when they saw the great dead body of Pitana, they were
struck with wonder. Everyone was astonished that Vasudeva had foretold
this mishap, and they praised Vasudeva for his power of foresight. The
inhabitants of Vraja cut the gigantic body of Patani into pieces, but be-
cause Krsna had sucked her breast, she had been freed from all sins, and
therefore when the cowherd men burned the pieces of her body in a fire,
the smoke filled the air with a very pleasing fragrance. Ultimately, al-
though [00803 had desired to kill Krsna, she attained the Lord’s abode.
From this incident we gain the instruction that if one is attached to Krsna
somehow or other, even as an enemy, one ultimately attains success.
What then is to be said of devotees who are naturally attached to Krsna in
love? When the inhabitants of Vraja heard about the killing of Patana
and the welfare of the child, they were very much satisfied. Nanda
Maharaja took the baby Krsna on his lap and was filled with satisfaction.

TRANSLATION
Sukadeva Gosvami continued: My dear King, while Nanda
Maharaja was on the way home, he considered that what Vasudeva
had said could not be false or useless. There must have been some
danger of disturbances in Gokula. As Nanda Maharaja thought
about the danger for his beautiful son, Krsna, he was afraid, and
he took shelter at the lotus feet of the supreme controller.
PURPORT
Whenever there is danger, the pure devotee thinks of the protection
and shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is also advised
in Bhagavad-gita (9.33): anityam asukham lokam imam prapya
bhajasva mam. In this material world there is danger at every step
(pada padari yad vipadam). Therefore a devotee has no other course
than to take shelter of the Lord at every step.

TRANSLATION

My dear King, wherever people in any position perform their
occupational duties of devotional service by chanting and hearing
[éravanarh kirtanarh visnoh], there cannot be any danger from bad
elements. Therefore there was no need for anxiety about Gokula
while the Supreme Personality of Godhead was personally present.

PURPORT

Sukadeva Gosvami spoke this verse to mitigate the anxiety of
Maharaja Pariksit. Maharaja Pariksit was a devotee of Krsna, and
therefore when he understood that Pitana was causing disturbances in
Gokula, he was somewhat perturbed. Sukadeva Gosvami therefore
assured him that there was no danger in Gokula. Srila Bhaktivinoda
Thakura has sung: namasraya kari’ yatane tumi, thakaha apana kaje.
Everyone is thus advised to seek shelter in the chanting of the Hare
Krsna maha-mantra and remain engaged in his own occupational duty.
There is no loss in this, and the gain is tremendous. Even from a material
point of view, everyone should take to chanting the Hare Krsna mantra
to be saved from all kinds of danger. This world is full of danger (padar
pada yad vipadam). Therefore we should be encouraged to chant the

Once upon a time, Piitana Raksasi, who could move according to
her desire and was wandering in outer space, converted herself by
mystic power into a very beautiful woman and thus entered
Gokula, the abode of Nanda Maharaja.
PURPORT
Raksasis learn mystic powers by which they can travel in outer space
without machines. In some parts of India there are still such mystical
witches, who can sit on a stick and use it to fly from one place to another
in a very short time. This art was known to Piitani. Assuming the
feature of a very beautiful woman, she entered Nanda Maharaja’s abode,
Gokula.

hair, adorned with a garland of mallika flowers, was scattered
about her beautiful face. Her earrings were brilliant, and as she
smiled very attractively, glancing upon everyone, her beauty drew
the attention of all the inhabitants of Vraja, especially the men.
When the gopis saw her, they thought that the beautiful goddess
of fortune, holding a lotus flower in her hand, had come to see her
husband, Krsna.

demons.

Lord Sri Krsna, the all-pervading Supersoul, lying on the bed,
understood that Piitana, a witch who was expert in killing small
children, had come to kill Him. Therefore, as if afraid of her,
Krsna closed His eyes. Thus Piitana took upon her lap Him who
was to be her own annihilation, just as an unintelligent person
places a sleeping snake on his lap, thinking the snake to be a rope.
PURPORT
In this verse there are two perplexities. When Krsna saw that Piatana
had come to kill Him, He thought that since this woman was present with

motherly affection, although artificial, He had to offer her a benediction.
Therefore He looked at her with a little perplexity and then closed His
eyes again. Pitana Raksasi also was perplexed. She was not intelligent
enough to understand that she was taking a sleeping snake on her lap;
she thought the snake to be an ordinary rope. The two words antakam
and anantam are contradictory. Because of not being intelligent, Patana
thought that she could kill her antakam, the source of her annihilation;
but because He is ananta, unlimited, no one can kill Him.

mained silent because she treated the child like a mother.

‘ PURPORT
Although Pitana was an outsider and although she personified fierce
death because the determination within her heart was to kill the child,
when she directly came and placed the child on her lap to offer the child
her breast to suck, the mothers were so captivated by her beauty that
they did not prohibit her. Sometimes a beautiful woman is dangerous be-
cause everyone, being captivated by external beauty (maya-mobhita), is
unable to understand what is in her mind. Those who are capti-
vated by the beauty of the external energy are called maya-mohita.
Mobhitariv nabhijanati mam ebhyah param avyayam (Bg. 7.13). Na te
viduh svartha-gatim hi vispurh durdsaya ye bahir-artha-maninah
(Bhag. 7.5.31). Here, of course, the two mothers Rohini and 36008 were
not maya-mobhita, deluded by the external energy, but to develop the
pastimes of the Lord, they were captivated by yogamaya. Such maya-
moha is the action of yogamaya.

Text 11] The Killing of the Demon Patana 11
TRANSLATION
On that very spot, the fiercely dangerous Riksasi took Krsna on
her lap and pushed her breast into His mouth. The nipple of her
breast was smeared with a dangerous, immediately effective
poison, but the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, becom-
ing very angry at her, took hold of her breast, squeezed it very
hard with both hands, and sucked out both the poison and her life.
PURPORT
Lord Krsna was not angry at Patana for His own sake. Rather, He was
angry because the Raksasi had killed so many small children in Vraja-
bhimi. Therefore He decided that she should be punished by having to
forfeit her life.

longer!” Perspiring, her eyes wide open and her arms and legs
flailing, she cried very loudly again and again.
PURPORT
The Raksasi was severely punished by Krsna. She threw her arms and
legs about, and Krsna also began to kick her with His legs to punish her
properly for her mischievous activities.

In this way the demon Piitana, very much aggrieved because her
breast was being attacked by Krsna, lost her life. O King Pariksit,
opening her mouth wide and spreading her arms, legs and hair,
she fell down in the pasturing ground in her original form as a
Raksasi, as Vrtrasura had fallen when killed by the thunderbolt of
Indra.
PURPORT
Piatana was a great Raksasi who knew the art of covering her original
form by mystic power, but when she was killed her mystic power could
not hide her, and she appeared in her original form.

breast, Putana, while dying, not only left the room but abandoned the
village and fell down in the pasturing ground in her gigantic body.

banks of a river, her arms, legs and feet seemed like big bridges,
and her abdomen appeared like a dried-up lake. The hearts, ears
and heads of the cowherd men and women were already shocked
by the Raksasi’s screaming, and when they saw the fierce wonder
of her body, they were even more frightened.

Here is the Supreme Personality of Godhead —Krsna. Although the
Raksasi Patana could increase or decrease her bodily size by her mystic
abilities and thus gain proportionate power, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead is equally powerful in any transcendental form. Krsna is the
real Personality of Godhead because whether as a child or as a grown-up

young man, He is the same person. He does not need to become powerful
by meditation or any other external endeavor. Therefore when the
greatly powerful Piitana expanded her body, Krsna remained the same
small child and fearlessly played on the upper portion of her breast. Sad-

ways full in all potencies, regardless of whether He is present in this
form or that. His potencies are always full. Pardsya saktir vividhaiva

Thereafter, mother Yasoda and Rohini, along with the other

PURPORT

When Krsna was saved from such a great danger, mother 36008 and
Rohini were principally concerned, and the other elderly gopis, who were
almost equally concerned, followed the activities of mother 36008 and
Rohini. Here we find that in household affairs, ladies could take charge

of protecting a child simply by taking help from the cow. As described
here, they knew how to wave about the switch of a cow so as to protect
the child from all types of danger. There are so many facilities afforded
by cow protection, but people have forgotten these arts. The importance
of protecting cows is therefore stressed by Krsna in Bhagavad-gita (krsi-
go-raksya-vanijyam vaisya-karma svabhavajam). Even now in the In-
dian villages surrounding Vrndavana, the villagers live happily simply
by giving protection to the cow. They keep cow dung very carefully and
dry it to use as fuel. They keep a sufficient stock of grains, and because
of giving protection to the cows, they have sufficient milk and milk prod-
ucts to solve all economic problems. Simply by giving protection to the
cow, the villagers live so peacefully. Even the urine and stool of cows
have medicinal value.

The child was thoroughly washed with cow urine and then
smeared with the dust raised by the movements of the cows. Then
different names of the Lord were applied with cow dung on twelve
different parts of His body, beginning with the forehead, as done
in applying tilaka. In this way, the child was given protection.

TRANSLATION
The gopis first executed the process of dcamana, drinking a sip
of water from the right hand. They purified their bodies and
hands with the nyasa-mantra and then applied the same mantra
upon the body of the child.
PURPORT
Nyasa-mantra includes acamana, or first drinking a sip of water kept
in the right hand. There are different vispu-mantras to purify the body.
The gopis, and in fact any householders, knew the process for being
purified by chanting Vedic hymns. The gopis executed this process first
to purify themselves and then to purify the child Krsna. One executes
the process of ariga-nydsa and kara-nyasa simply by drinking a little sip
of water and chanting the mantra. The mantra is preceded with the first
letter of the name, followed by anusvdra and the word namah: arm namo
‘jas tavanghri avyat, mam mano manimaris tava januni avydt, and so
on. By losing Indian culture, Indian householders have forgotten how to
execute the arniga-nyasa and are simply busy in sense gratification, with-
out any advanced knowledge of human civilization.

[Sukadeva Gosvami informed Maharaja Pariksit that the gopis,
following the proper system, protected Krsna, their child, with
this mantra.] May Aja protect Your legs, may Maniman protect
Your knees, Yajiia Your thighs, Acyuta the upper part of Your
waist, and Hayagriva Your abdomen. May Kesava protect Your
heart, Isa Your chest, the sun-god Your neck, Vignu Your arms,
Urukrama Your face, and Iévara Your head. May Cakri protect You

sword, protect Your two sides. May Lord Urugaya, the carrier of
the conchshell, protect You from all corners; may Upendra protect
You from above; may Garuda protect You on the ground; and may
Lord Haladhara, the Supreme Person, protect You on all sides.

PURPORT

Even in the houses of the cultivators, who were not very advanced in
the modern ways of civilization, the ladies used to know how to chant
mantras to give protection to children with the help of cow dung and cow
urine. This was a simple and practical way to give the greatest protection
from the greatest dangers. People should know how to do this, for this is
a part of Vedic civilization.

ready to give trouble to the body, the life air and the senses, caus-
ing loss of memory, madness and bad dreams. Like the most ex-
perienced evil stars, they all create great disturbances, especially
for children, but one can vanquish them simply by uttering Lord
Visnu’s name, for when Lord Visnu’s name resounds, all of them
become afraid and go away.

vedesu durlabham adurlabham atma-bhaktau

“I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda, who is the
original person —nondual, infallible, and without beginning. Although
He expands into unlimited forms, He is still the original, and although
He is the oldest person, He always appears as a fresh youth. Such eternal,
blissful and all-knowing forms of the Lord cannot be understood by the
academic wisdom of the Vedas, but they are always manifest to pure,
unalloyed devotees.”

While decorating the body with tilaka, we give protection to the body
by chanting twelve names of Visnu. Although Govinda, or Lord Visnu, is
one, He has different names and forms with which to act differently. But
if one cannot remember all the names at one time, one may simply chant,
“Lord Visnu, Lord Visnu, Lord Visnu,” and always think of Lord Visnu.
Visnor aradhanarm param: this is the highest form of worship. If one
remembers Visnu always, even though one is disturbed by many bad ele-
ments, one can be protected without a doubt. The Ayurveda-sastra
recommends, ausadhi cintayet visnum: even while taking medicine, one
should remember Visnu, because the medicine is not all and all and Lord
Visnu is the real protector. The material world is full of danger (pada = -
padam yad vipadam). Therefore one must become a Vaisnava and think
of Visnu constantly. This is made easier by the chanting of the Hare
Krsna maha-mantra. Therefore Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has recom-

Yasoda; sannyavesayat—made to lie down on the bed; atmajam—her
son.

’ TRANSLATION

Srila Sukadeva Gosvami continued: All the gopis, headed by
mother Ya§oda, were bound by maternal affection. After they thus
chanted mantras to protect the child, mother Yasoda gave the child
the nipple of her breast to suck and then got Him to lie down on
His bed.

PURPORT

When a baby drinks milk from the breast of his mother, this is a good
sign of health. So the elderly gopis were not satisfied with chanting
mantras to give protection to Krsna; they also tested whether their
child’s health was in order. When the child sucked the breast, this con-
firmed that He was healthy, and when the gopis were fully satisfied, they
had the child lie down on His bed.

TRANSLATION
Meanwhile, all the cowherd men, headed by Nanda Maharaja,
returned from Mathura, and when they saw on the way the gigantic
body of Putana lying dead, they were struck with great wonder.
PURPORT
Nanda Maharaja’s wonder may be understood in various ways. First of
all, the cowherd men had never before seen such a gigantic body in
Vrndavana, and therefore they were struck with wonder. Then they
began to consider where such a body had come from, whether it had
dropped from the sky, or whether, by some mistake or by the power of
some mystic yogini, they had come to some place other than Vrndavana.
They could not actually guess what had happened, and therefore they
were struck with wonder.

great saint or a master of mystic power. Otherwise how could he
have foreseen this calamity and predicted it to us?


--- Page 34 ---
28 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 10, Ch. 6
PURPORT

This verse illustrates the difference between ksatriyas and innocent
vai§yas. By studying the political situation, Vasudeva could see what
would happen, whereas Nanda Maharaja, the king of the agriculturalists,
could only guess that Vasudeva was a great saintly person and had
developed mystic powers. Vasudeva actually had all mystic powers under
his control; otherwise he could not have become the father of Krsna. But
in fact he foresaw the calamities in Vraja by studying Karsa’s political
activities and thus warned Nanda Maharaja to take precautions, although
Nanda Maharaja thought that Vasudeva had predicted this incident
through wonderful mystic powers. By mystic powers gained through the
practice of hatha-yoga, one can study and understand the future.

ing with air. Merely killing a serpent is not sufficient; after it is killed, it

the same precautions by burning her body to ashes.

Because of Krsna’s having sucked the breast of the Raksasi

material contamination. Her sinful reactions automatically
vanished, and therefore when her gigantic body was being burnt,
the smoke emanating from her body was fragrant like aguru
incense.
PURPORT .
Such are the effects of Krsna consciousness. If one somehow or other
becomes Krsna conscious by applying his senses in the service of the
Lord, one is immediately freed from material contamination. Srnvatarm
sva-kathah krsnah punya-sravana-kirtanah (Bhag. 1.2.17). Hearing
about the activities of Krsna is the beginning of purified life. Punya-
§ravana-kirtanah: simply by hearing and chanting, one becomes

purified. Therefore, in discharging devotional service, sravana-kirtana
(hearing and chanting) is most important. Then, with purified senses,
one begins to render service to the Lord (hrsikena hrsikesa-sevanam).
Bhaktir ucyate: this is called bhakti. When Pitana was somehow or
other, directly or indirectly, induced to render some service to the Lord
by feeding Him with her breast, she was immediately purified, so much
so that when her nasty material body was burnt to ashes, it gave off the
fragrance of aguru, the most agreeably scented herb.

TRANSLATION
Puatana was always hankering for the blood of human children,
and with that desire she came to kill Krsna; but because she
offered her breast to the Lord, she attained the greatest achieve-
ment. What then is to be said of those who had natural devotion
and affection for Krsna as mothers and who offered Him their
breasts to suck or offered something very dear, as a mother offers
something to a child?
PURPORT
00818 had no affection for Krsna; rather, she was envious and
wanted to kill Him. Nonetheless, because with or without knowledge she
offered her breast, she attained the highest achievement in life. But the
offerings of devotees attracted to Krsna in parental love are always sin-
cere. A mother likes to offer something to her child with affection and
love; there is no question of envy. So here we can make a comparative
study. If Patana could attain such an exalted position in spiritual life by
neglectfully, enviously making an offering to Krsna, what is to be said of
mother Yasoda and the other gopis, who served Krsna with such great
affection and love, offering everything for Krsna’s satisfaction? The
gopis automatically achieved the highest perfection. Therefore Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu recommended the affection of the gopis, either in
maternal affection or in conjugal love, as the highest perfection in life
(ramya kacid upasana vrajavadhi-vargena ya kalpita).

pleasure and sucked her breast, although she was a great witch, she
attained the position of a mother in the transcendental world and
thus achieved the highest perfection. What then is to be said of the
cows whose nipples Krsna sucked with great pleasure and who
offered their milk very jubilantly with affection exactly like that of
a mother?


--- Page 39 ---
Text 40] The Killing of the Demon Pitana 33
PURPORT
These verses explain how devotional service rendered to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, whether directly or indirectly, knowingly or
unknowingly, becomes successful. Patani was neither a devotee nor a
nondevotee; she was actually a demoniac witch instructed by Karmsa to
kill Krsna. Nonetheless, in the beginning she assumed the form of a very
beautiful woman and approached Krsna exactly like an affectionate
mother, so that mother (36003 and Rohini did not doubt her sincerity.
The Lord took all this into consideration, and thus she was automatically
promoted to a position like that of mother Yasoda. As explained by
Viévanatha Cakravarti Thakura, there are various roles one may play in
such a position. Patana was immediately promoted to Vaikunthaloka,
which is also sometimes described as Svarga. The Svarga mentioned in
this verse is not the material heavenly planet, but the transcendental
world. In Vaikunthaloka, Patana attained the position of a nurse
(dhatry-ucitam), as described by Uddhava. Patana was elevated to the
position of a nurse and maidservant in Goloka Vrndavana to assist
mother 03600 3.

TRANSLATION

The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, is the bestower of
many benedictions, including liberation [kaivalya], or oneness
with the Brahman effulgence. For that Personality of Godhead, the
gopis always felt maternal love, and Krsna sucked their breasts
with full satisfaction. Therefore, because of their relationship as
mother and son, although the gopis were engaged in various
family activities, one should never think that they returned to this
material world after leaving their bodies.

PURPORT

The advantage of Krsna consciousness is described herein. Krsna con-
sciousness gradually develops on the transcendental platform. One may
think of Krsna as the supreme personality, one may think of Krsna as the
supreme master, one may think of Krsna as the supreme friend, one may
think of Krsna as the supreme son, or one may think of Krsna as the
supreme conjugal lover. If one is connected with Krsna in any of these
transcendental relationships, the course of one’s material life is under-
stood to have already ended. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (4.9),
tyaktva deharih punar janma naiti mam eti: for such devotees, going
back home, back to Godhead, is guaranteed. Na punah kalpate rajan
sarisaro ’jaiana-sambhavah. This verse also guarantees that devotees


--- Page 41 ---
Text 41] The Killing of the Demon Piitana 35
who constantly think of Krsna in a particular relationship will never
return to this material world. In this material world of samsdra, there are
the same relationships. One thinks, “Here is my son,” “Here is my
wife,” “Here is my lover,” or “Here is my friend.” But these relation-
ships are temporary illusions. Ajigna-sambhavah: such a consciousness
awakens in ignorance. But when the same relationships awaken in Krsna
consciousness, one’s spiritual life is revived, and one is guaranteed to
return home, back to Godhead. Even though the gopis who were friends
of Rohini and mother Yasoda and who allowed their breasts to be sucked
by Krsna were not directly Krsna’s mothers, they all had the same chance
as Rohini and (36003 to go back to Godhead and act as Krsna’s mothers-
in-law, servants and so on. The word samsara refers to attachment for
one’s body, home, husband or wife, and children, but although the gopis
and all the other inhabitants of Vrndavana had the same affection and at-
tachment for husband and home, their central affection was for Krsna in
some transcendental relationship, and therefore they were guaranteed to
be promoted to Goloka Vrndavana in the next life, to live with Krsna
eternally in spiritual happiness. The easiest way to attain spiritual eleva-
tion, to be liberated from this material world, and to go back home, back
to Godhead, is recommended by Bhaktivinoda Thakura: krsnera sarmsara
kara chadi’ anacara. One should give up all sinful activities and remain
in the family of Krsna. Then one’s liberation is guaranteed.

very favorable. Therefore upon smelling such a wonderful fragrance,
the inhabitants of Vraja were astonished.

O Maharaja Pariksit, best of the Kurus, Nanda Maharaja was very
liberal and simple. He immediately took his son Krsna on his lap as
if Krsna had returned from death, and by formally smelling his
son’s head, Nanda Maharaja undoubtedly enjoyed transcendental
bliss.

PURPORT

Nanda Maharaja could not understand how the inhabitants of his
house had allowed Piitana to enter the house, nor could he imagine the
gravity of the situation. He did not understand that Krsna had wanted to
kill Pdtana and that His pastimes were performed by yogamaya. Nanda
Maharaja simply thought that someone had entered his house and created
havoc. This was Nanda Maharaja’s simplicity.

TRANSLATION
Any person who hears with faith and devotion about how Krsna,
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, killed Piatana, and who thus
invests his hearing in such childhood pastimes of Krsna, certainly
attains attachment for Govinda, the supreme, original person.
PURPORT
The incident in which the great witch attempted to kill the child but
was killed herself is certainly wonderful. Therefore this verse uses the
word adbhutam, meaning “‘specifically wonderful.” Krsna has left us
many wonderful narrations about Him. Simply by reading these narra-
tions, as they are described in Krsna, the Supreme Personality of God-
head, one gains salvation from this material world and gradually
develops attachment to and devotion for Govinda, Adi-purusa.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Tenth Canto, Sixth
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “The Killing of the Demon
Patana.”

CHAPTER SEVEN
The Killing of the Demon Trnavarta
In this chapter, Sri Krsna’s pastimes of breaking the cart (Sakata-
bhanjana), killing the asura known as Trnavarta, and demonstrating the
entire universe within His mouth are especially described.

When Sukadeva Gosvami saw that Maharaja Pariksit was eagerly wait-
ing to hear about Lord Krsna’s pastimes as a child, he was very much
pleased, and he continued to speak. When Sri Krsna was only three
months old and was just trying to turn backside up, before He even at-
tempted to crawl, mother Yaoda wanted to observe a ritualistic
ceremony with her friends for the good fortune of the child. Such a
ritualistic ceremony is generally performed with ladies who also have
small children. When mother Yasoda saw that Krsna was falling asleep,
because of other engagements she put the child underneath a household
cart, called Sakata, and while the child was sleeping, she engaged herself
in other business pertaining to the auspicious ritualistic ceremony.
Underneath the cart was a cradle, and mother Yasoda placed the child in
that cradle. The child was sleeping, but suddenly He awakened and, as
usual for a child, began to kick His small legs. This kicking shook the
cart, which collapsed with a great sound, breaking completely and spill-
ing all its contents. Children who were playing nearby immediately in-
formed mother Yasoda that the cart had broken, and therefore she
hastily arrived there in great anxiety with the other gopis. Mother Yasoda
immediately took the child on her lap and allowed Him to suck her
breast. Then various types of Vedic ritualistic ceremonies were per-
formed with the help of the brahmanas. Not knowing the real identity of
the child, the brahmanas showered the child with blessings.

Another day, when mother Ya$oda was sitting with her child on her
lap, she suddenly observed that he had assumed the weight of the entire
universe. She was so astonished that she had to put the child down, and
in the meantime Trnavarta, one of the servants of Karisa, appeared there
as a whirlwind and took the child away. The whole tract of land known as
Gokula became surcharged with dust, no one could see where the child

39


--- Page 46 ---
40 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 10, Ch. 7
had been taken, and all the gopis were overwhelmed because He had
been taken away in the dust storm. But up in the sky, the asura, being
overburdened by the child, could not carry the child far away, although
he also could not drop the child because the child had caught him so
tightly that it was difficult for him to separate the child from his body.
Thus Trnavarta himself fell down from a very great height, the child
grasping him tightly by the shoulder, and immediately died. The demon
having fallen, the gopis picked the child up and delivered Him to the lap
of mother 86008. Thus mother Yasoda was struck with wonder, but be-
cause of yogamaya’s influence, no one could understand who Krsna was
and what had actually happened. Rather, everyone began to praise for-
tune for the child’s having been saved from such a calamity. Nanda
Maharaja, of course, was thinking of the wonderful foretelling of
Vasudeva and began to praise him as a great yogi. Later, when the child
was on the lap of mother Yasoda, the child yawned, and mother Yasoda
could see within His mouth the entire universal manifestation.

TRANSLATION

King Pariksit said: My lord, Sukadeva Gosvami, all the various
activities exhibited by the incarnations of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead are certainly pleasing to the ear and to the mind.
Simply by one’s hearing of these activities, the dirty things in
one’s mind immediately vanish. Generally we are reluctant to hear
about the activities of the Lord, but Krsna’s childhood activities
are so attractive that they are automatically pleasing to the mind
and ear. Thus one’s attachment for hearing about material things,
which is the root cause of material existence, vanishes, and one
gradually develops devotional service to the Supreme Lord, attach-
ment for Him, and friendship with devotees who give us the con-
tribution of Krsna consciousness. If you think it fit, kindly speak
about those activities of the Lord.

PURPORT
As stated in the Prema-vivarta:


--- Page 48 ---
42 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 10, Ch. 7

krsna-bahirmukha haiya bhoga-varncha kare
nikata-stha maya tare japatiya dhare
Our material existence is maya, or illusion, in which we desire different
varieties of material enjoyment and therefore change to different
varieties of bodies (bhramayan sarva-bhitani yantrarudhani mayaya).
Asann api klesada asa dehah: as long as we have these temporary bodies,
they give us many varieties of tribulation —adhyatmika, adhibhautika
and adhidaivika. This is the root cause of all suffering, but this root
cause of suffering can be removed by revival of our Krsna consciousness.
All the Vedic literatures presented by Vyasadeva and other great sages
are therefore intended to revive our Krsna consciousness, which
begins to revive with Sravana-kirtanam. Srnvatari sva-kathah krsnah
(Bhag. 1.2.17). Srimad-Bhagavatam and other Vedic literatures exist
simply to give us a chance to hear about Krsna. Krsna has different
avatdras, or incarnations, all of which are wonderful and which arouse
one’s inquisitiveness, but generally such avataras as Matsya, Karma and
Variha are not as attractive as Krsna. First of all, however, we have no
attraction for hearing about Krsna, and this is the root cause of our
suffering.

But Pariksit Maharaja specifically mentions that the wonderful ac-
tivities of baby Krsna, which amazed mother Yaéoda and the other in-
habitants of Vraja, are especially attractive. From the very beginning of
His childhood, Krsna killed Pitana, Trpavarta and Sakatasura and
showed the entire universe within His mouth. Thus the pastimes of
Krsna, one after another, kept mother Yasoda and all the inhabitants of
Vraja in great astonishment. The process to revive one’s Krsna con-
sciousness is adau नवतक tatah sadhu-sarigah (Bhakti-rasamrta-
sindhu 1.4.15). The pastimes of Krsna can be properly received from
devotees. If one has developed a little bit of Krsna consciousness by hear-
ing from Vaisnavas about the activities of Krsna, one becomes attached to
Vaisnavas who are interested only in Krsna consciousness. Therefore
Pariksit Maharaja recommends that one hear about Krsna’s childhood ac-
tivities, which are more attractive than the activities of other incarna-
tions, such as Matsya, Karma and Varaha. Wanting to hear more and
more from Sukadeva Gosvami, Maharaja Pariksit requested him to con-

tinue describing Krsna’s childhood activities, which are especially easy to
hear and which create more and more inquisitiveness.

pastimes; manusam—as if playing as a human child; lokam asadya—

TRANSLATION

Please describe other pastimes of Krsna, the Supreme Per-
sonality, who appeared on this planet earth, imitating a human
child and performing wonderful activities like killing Patana.

PURPORT

Maharaja Pariksit requested Sukadeva Gosvami to narrate other child-
hood pastimes exhibited by Krsna while playing as a human child. The
Supreme Personality of Godhead incarnates at different times in dif-
ferent planets and universes, and according to the nature of those places,
He exhibits His unlimited potency. That a child sitting on the lap of his
mother was able to kill the gigantic Pitana is extremely wonderful for
the inhabitants of this planet, but on other planets the inhabitants are
more advanced, and therefore the pastimes the Lord performs there are
still more wonderful. Krsna’s appearance on this planet like a human
being makes us more fortunate than the demigods in the higher planets,


--- Page 50 ---
44 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 10, Ch. 7
and therefore Maharaja Pariksit was very much interested in hearing
about Him.

TRANSLATION

Sukadeva Gosvami said: When mother १०६०१३१३ baby was slant-
ing His body to attempt to rise and turn around, this attempt was
observed by a Vedic ceremony. In such a ceremony, called utthana,
which is performed when a child is due to leave the house for the
first time, the child is properly bathed. Just after Krsna turned
three months old, mother 86008 celebrated this ceremony with


--- Page 51 ---
Text 5] The Killing of the Demon Trnavarta 45
other women of the neighborhood. On that day, there was a con-
junction of the moon with the constellation Rohini. As the
brahmanas joined by chanting Vedic hymns and professional musi-
cians also took part, this great ceremony was observed by mother
Yasoda.
PURPORT

There is no question of overpopulation or of children’s being a burden
for their parents in a Vedic society. Such a society is so well organized
and people are so advanced in spiritual consciousness that childbirth is
never regarded as a burden or a botheration. The more a child grows, the
more his parents become jubilant, and the child’s attempts to turn over
are also a source of jubilation. Even before the child is born, when the
mother is pregnant, many recommended ritualistic ceremonies are per-
formed. For example, when the child has been within the womb for three
months and for seven months, there is a ceremony the mother observes
by eating with neighboring children. This ceremony is called svada-
bhaksana. Similarly, before the birth of the child there is the
garbhadhana ceremony. In Vedic civilization, childbirth or pregnancy is
never regarded as a burden; rather, it is a cause for jubilation. In con-
trast, people in modern civilization do not like pregnancy or childbirth,
and when there is a child, they sometimes kill it. We can just consider
how human society has fallen since the inauguration of Kali-yuga. Al-
though people still claim to be civilized, at the present moment there is
actually no human civilization, but only an assembly of two-legged
animals.

TRANSLATION
After completing the bathing ceremony for the child, mother
Yasoda received the brahmanas by worshiping them with proper
respect and giving them ample food grains and other eatables,
clothing, desirable cows, and garlands. The brahmanas properly
chanted Vedic hymns to observe the auspicious ceremony, and
when they finished and mother 86008 saw that the child felt
sleepy, she lay down on the bed with the child until He was
peacefully asleep.
PURPORT
An affectionate mother takes great care of her child and is always anx-
ious to see that the child is not disturbed even for a moment. As long as
the child wants to remain with the mother, the mother stays with the
child, and the child feels very comfortable. Mother Yasoda saw that her
child felt sleepy, and to give Him all facilities for sleep, she lay down
with the child, and when He was peaceful, she got up to attend to her
other household affairs.

TRANSLATION

The liberal mother Ya$oda, absorbed in celebrating the utthana
ceremony, was busy receiving guests, worshiping them with all
respect and offering them clothing, cows, garlands and grains.
Thus she could not hear the child crying for His mother. At that
time, the child Krsna, demanding to drink the milk of His

mother’s breast, angrily threw His legs upward.

PURPORT

Krsna had been placed underneath a household handcart, but this
handcart was actually another form of the Sakatasura, a demon who had
come there to kill the child. Now, on the plea of demanding to suck His
mother’s breast, Krsna took this opportunity to kill the demon. Thus He
kicked Sakatasura just to expose him. Although Krsna’s mother was
engaged in receiving guests, Lord Krsna wanted to draw her attention by
killing the Sakatasura, and therefore he kicked that cart-shaped demon.
Such are the pastimes of Krsna. Krsna wanted to draw the attention of
His mother, but while doing so He created a great havoc not understand-
able by ordinary persons. These narrations are wonderfully enjoyable,
and those who are fortunate are struck with wonder upon hearing of
these extraordinary activities of the Lord. Although the less intelligent


--- Page 54 ---
48 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 10, Ch. 7
regard them as mythological because a dull brain cannot understand
them, they are real facts. These narrations are actually so enjoyable and
enlightening that Maharaja Pariksit and Sukadeva Gosvami took
pleasure in them, and other liberated persons, following in their
footsteps, become fully jubilant by hearing about the wonderful activities
of the Lord.

Lord Sri Krsna was lying down underneath the handcart in one

corner of the courtyard, and although His little legs were as soft as
leaves, when He struck the cart with His legs, it turned over
violently and collapsed. The wheels separated from the axle, the
hubs and spokes fell apart, and the pole of the handcart broke. On
the cart there were many little utensils made of various metals, and
all of them scattered hither and thither.


--- Page 55 ---
Text 8] The Killing of the Demon Trnavarta 49
PURPORT
Srila Viévanatha Cakravarti Thakura has commented on this verse as
follows. When Lord Krsna was of a very tender age, His hands and legs
resembled soft new leaves, yet simply by touching the handcart with His
legs, He made the cart fall to pieces. It was quite possible for Him to act
in this way and yet not exert Himself very much. The Lord in His
Vamana avatara had to extend His foot to the greatest height to penetrate
the covering of the universe, and when the Lord killed the gigantic
demon Hiranyakasdipu, He had to assume the special bodily feature of
Nrsimhadeva. But in His Krsna avatdra, the Lord did not need to exert
such energy. Therefore, krsnas tu bhagavan svayam: Krsna is the
Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. In other incarnations, the
Lord had to exert some energy according to the time and circumstances,
but in this form He exhibited unlimited potency. Thus the handcart col-
lapsed, its joints broken, and all the metal pots and utensils scattered.
The Vaisnava-tosani remarks that although the handcart was higher
than the child, the child could easily touch the wheel of the cart, and this
was sufficient to send the demon down to the earth. The Lord .
simultaneously pushed the demon to the earth and superficially broke
the handcart.

TRANSLATION
The assembled cowherd men and ladies began to contemplate
how this thing had happened. ¢“Is it the work of some demon or
evil planet?” they asked. At that time, the small children present
asserted that the cart had been kicked apart by the baby Krsna. As


--- Page 57 ---
Text 9] The Killing of the Demon Trnavarta 51
soon as the crying baby had kicked the cart’s wheel, the cart had
collapsed. There was no doubt about it.
PURPORT

We have heard of people’s being haunted by ghosts. Having no gross
material body, a ghost seeks shelter of a gross body to stay in and haunt.
The Sakatasura was a ghost who had taken shelter of the handcart and
was looking for the opportunity to do mischief to Krsna. When Krsna
kicked the cart with His small and very delicate legs, the ghost was im-
mediately pushed down to the earth and his shelter dismantled, as
already described. This was possible for Krsna because He has full po-
tency, as confirmed in the Brahma-samhita (5.32):

arigani yasya sakalendriya-vrttimanti
pasyanti panti kalayanti cirari jaganti
ananda-cinmaya-sad-ujjvala-vigrahasya
govindam adi-purusarin tam aha bhajami

Krsna’s body is sac-cid-ananda-vigraha, or ananda-cinmaya-rasa-
vigraha. That is, any of the parts of His ananda-cinmaya body can act
for any other part. Such are the inconceivable potencies of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. The Supreme Lord does not need to acquire
these potencies; He already has them. Thus Krsna kicked His little legs,
and His whole purpose was fulfilled. Also, when the handcart broke, an
ordinary child could have been injured in many ways, but because Krsna
is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He enjoyed the dismantling of
the cart, and nothing injured Him. Everything done by Him is ananda-
cinmaya-rasa, full transcendental bliss. Thus Krsna factually enjoyed.

The nearby children saw that actually Krsna had kicked the wheel of
the cart and this was how the accident happened. By the arrangement of
yogamayad, all the gopis and gopas thought that the accident had taken
place because of some bad planet or some ghost, but in fact everything
was done by Krsna and enjoyed by Him. Those who enjoy the activities of
Krsna are also on the platform of ananda-cinmaya-rasa; they are liber-
ated from the material platform. When one develops the practice of hear-
ing krsna-kathd, he is certainly transcendental to material existence, as
confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (sa gunan samatityaitan brahma-bhiyaya


--- Page 58 ---
52 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 10, Ch. 7
kalpate). Unless one is on the spiritual platform, one cannot enjoy the
transcendental activities of Krsna; or in other words, whoever engages in
hearing the transcendental activities of Krsna is not on the material plat-
form, but on the transcendental, spiritual platform.

the custom of Vedic civilization to have qualified brahmanas im-
mediately chant Vedic hymns to counteract it. Mother 86003 did this
properly and allowed the baby to suck her breast.

PURPORT
The handcart was loaded with heavy utensils and other paraphernalia.
To set the cart back in its original position required much strength, but
this was easily done by the cowherd men. Then, according to the system
of the gopa-jati, various Vedic ceremonies were performed to appease the
calamitous situation.

TRANSLATION

‘When brahmanas are free from envy, untruthfulness, unneces-
sary pride, grudges, disturbance by the opulence of others, and
false prestige, their blessings never go in vain. Considering this,
Nanda Maharaja soberly took Krsna on his lap and invited such
truthful brahmanas to perform a ritualistic ceremony according to
the holy hymns of the Sama Veda, Rg Veda and Yajur Veda. Then,
while the hymns were being chanted, he bathed the child with
water mixed with pure herbs, and after performing a fire
ceremony, he sumptuously fed all the brahmanas with first-class
grains and other food.

PURPORT

Nanda Maharaja was very confident about the qualifications of the

brahmanas and their blessings. He was fully confident that simply if the


--- Page 62 ---
56 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 10, Ch. 7
good brahmanas showered their blessings, the child Krsna would be
happy. The blessings of qualified brahmanas can bring happiness not
only to Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but to everyone. Be-
cause Krsna is self-sufficient, He does not require anyone’s blessings, yet
Nanda Maharaja thought that Krsna required the blessings of the
brahmanas. What then is to be said of others? In human society,
therefore, there must be an ideal class of men, brahmanas, who can
bestow blessings upon others, namely, upon the ksatriyas, vaiSyas and
Siadras, so that everyone will be happy. Krsna therefore says in
Bhagavad-gita (4.13) that human society must have four social orders
(catur-varnyam maya srstar guna-karma-vibhagasah); it is not that
everyone should become a Sidra or a vai§ya and human society will
prosper. As enunciated in Bhagavad-gita, there must be a class of
brahmanas with qualities like satya (truthfulness), sama (peacefulness),
dama (self-control) and titiksa (tolerance).

Here also, in the Bhagavatam, Nanda Maharaja invites qualified
brahmanas. There may be caste brahmanas, and we have all respect for
them, but their birth in brahmana families does not mean that they are
qualified to bestow blessings upon the other members of human society.
This is the verdict of the sastras. In Kali-yuga, caste brahmanas are ac-
cepted as brahmanas. Vipratve sitram eva hi (Bhag. 12.2.3): in Kali-
yuga, simply by putting on a thread worth two paise, one becomes a
brahmana. Such brahmanas were not called for by Nanda Maharaja. As
stated by Narada Muni (Bhag. 7.11.35), yasya yal laksanar proktam.
The symptoms of a brahmana are stated in $astra, and one must be
qualified with these symptoms.

The blessings of brahmanas who are not envious, disturbed or puffed
up with pride and false prestige and who are fully qualified with
truthfulness will be useful. Therefore a class of men must be trained as
brahmanas from the very beginning. Brahmacari guru-kule vasan danto
guror hitam (Bhag. 7.12.1). The word dantah is very important. Dantah
refers to one who is not envious, disturbing or puffed up with false
prestige. With the Krsna consciousness movement, we are trying to in-
troduce such brahmanas in society. Brahmanas must ultimately be
Vaisnavas, and if one is a Vaisnava, he has already acquired the
qualifications of a brahmana. Brahma-bhitah prasannatma (Bg. 18.54).
The word brahma-bhiita refers to becoming a brahmana, or understand-


--- Page 63 ---
Text 15] The Killing of the Demon Trnavarta 57
ing what is Brahman (brahma janatiti brahmanah). One who is brahma-
bhiita is always happy (prasannatma). Na $ocati na kariksati: he is never
disturbed about material necessities. Samah sarvesu bhiitesu: he is ready
to bestow blessings upon everyone equally. Mad-bhaktirh labhate param:
then he becomes a Vaispava. In this age, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati
Thakura introduced the sacred thread ceremony for his Vaisnava disci-
ples, with the idea that people should understand that when one becomes
a Vaisnava he has already acquired the qualifications of a brahmana.
Therefore in the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, those
who are twice initiated so as to become brahmanas must bear in mind
their great responsibility to be truthful, control the mind and senses, be
tolerant, and so on. Then their life will be successful. It was such
brahmanas that Nanda Maharaja invited to chant the Vedic hymns, not
ordinary brahmanas. Verse thirteen distinctly mentions himsa-mana.
The word mana refers to false prestige or false pride. Those who were
falsely proud, thinking that they were brahmanas because they were
born in brahmana families, were never invited by Nanda Maharaja on
such occasions.

Verse fourteen mentions pavitrausadhi. In any ritualistic ceremony,
many herbs and leaves were required. These were known as pavitra-
patra. Sometimes there were nimba leaves, sometimes bael leaves,
mango leaves, asvattha leaves or dmalaki leaves. Similarly, there were
paifica-gavya, paiica-sasya and pafica-ratna. Although Nanda Maharaja
belonged to the vaiS§ya community, everything was known to him.

The most important word in these verses is maha-gunam, indicating
that the brahmanas were offered very palatable food of exalted quality.
Such palatable dishes were generally prepared with two things, namely
food grains and milk products. Bhagavad-gita (18.44) therefore enjoins
that human society must give protection to the cows and encourage
agriculture (krsi-go-raksya-vanijyari vaisya-karma svabhavajam). Sim-
ply by expert cooking, hundreds and thousands of palatable dishes can be
prepared from agricultural produce and milk products. This is indicated
here by the words annam maha-gunam. Still today in India, from these
two things, namely food grains and milk, hundreds and thousands of
varieties of food are prepared, and then they are offered to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. (Catur-vidha-sri-bhagavat-prasada. Patram
puspari phalar toyar yo me bhaktya prayacchati.) Then the prasada is


--- Page 64 ---
58 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 10, Ch. 7
distributed. Even today in Jagannatha-ksetra and other big temples, very
palatable dishes are offered to the Deity, and prasada is distributed
profusely. Cooked by first-class brahmanas with expert knowledge and
then distributed to the public, this prasada is also a blessing from the
brahmanas or Vaisnavas. There are four kinds of prasada (catur-vidha).
Salty, sweet, sour and pungent tastes are made with different types of
spices, and the food is prepared in four divisions, called carvya, cisya,
lehya and pehya—prasada that is chewed, prasada that is licked,
prasada tasted with the tongue, and prasada that is drunk. Thus there
are many varieties of prasada, prepared very nicely with grains and
ghee, offered to the Deity and distributed to the brahmanas and
Vaisnavas and then to the general public. This is the way of human
society. Killing the cows and spoiling the land will not solve the problem
of food. This is not civilization. Uncivilized men living in the jungle and
being unqualified to produce food by agriculture and cow protection may
eat animals, but a perfect human society advanced in knowledge must
learn how to produce first-class food simply by agriculture and protection
of cows.

Brahmanas fully equipped with the brahminical qualifications are al-

tainly dependable. In this age, however, one must take into account that


--- Page 66 ---
60 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 10, Ch. 7
the brahmanas are uncertain in their qualifications. Because there are no
yajiiic brahmanas, all yajiias are forbidden. The only yajfia recom-
mended in this age is sarkirtana-yajiia. Yajiiaih sankirtana-prayair
yajanti hi sumedhasah (Bhag. 11.5.32). Yajiia is meant to satisfy Visnu
(yajiiarthat karmano ’nyatra loko ’yam karma-bandhanah). Because in
this age there are no qualified brahmanas, people should perform yajiia
by chanting the Hare Krsna mantra (yajiiaih sankirtana-prayair yajanti
hi sumedhasah). Life is meant for yajiia, and yajiia is performed by the
chanting of Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare
Rama, Hare Rima, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.

stood that Krsna was aware of the coming of Trnavartasura, who would
take Him far away from His mother. Krsna knew that when Trpavarta
came and took Him away from His mother’s lap, mother 08600 3 would be
greatly bereaved. He did not want His mother to suffer any difficulty
from the demon. Therefore, because He is the source of everything (jan-
mady asya yatah), He assumed the heaviness of the entire universe. The
child was on the lap of Yadoda, who was therefore in possession of every-
thing in the world, but when the child assumed such heaviness, she had
to put Him down in order to give Trnavartisura an opportunity to take
Him away and play with Him for some time before the child returned to
the lap of His mother.

TRANSLATION

Feeling the child to be as heavy as the entire universe and
therefore being anxious, thinking that perhaps the child was being
attacked by some other ghost or demon, the astonished mother
Yasoda put the child down on the ground and began to think of
Narayana. Foreseeing disturbances, she called for the brahmanas
to counteract this heaviness, and then she engaged in her other
household affairs. She had no alternative than to remember the
lotus feet of Narayana, for she could not understand that Krsna
was the original source of everything.


--- Page 68 ---
62 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 10, Ch. 7
PURPORT
Mother Yasoda did not understand that Krsna is the heaviest of all
heavy things and that Krsna rests within everything (mat-sthani sarva-
bhatani). As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (9.4), maya tatam 1027
sarvari jagad avyakta-miirtina: Krsna is everywhere in His impersonal
form, and everything rests upon Him. Nonetheless, na cahari tesv
avasthitah: Krsna is not everywhere. Mother 36008 was unable to
understand this philosophy because she was dealing with Krsna as His
real mother by the arrangement of yogamaya. Not understanding the
importance of Krsna, she could only seek shelter of Narayana for Krsna’s
safety and call the brahmanas to counteract the situation.

very much aggrieved and joined mother Yasoda in crying, their
eyes full of tears.

PURPORT

This attachment of the gopis to Krsna is wonderful and transcenden-
tal. The center of all the activities of the gopis was Krsna. When Krsna
was there they were happy, and when Krsna was not there, they were
unhappy. Thus when mother Yaéoda was lamenting Krsna’s absence, the
other ladies also began to cry.

TRANSLATION

Having assumed the form of a forceful whirlwind, the demon
Trnavarta took Krsna very high in the sky, but when Krsna be-
came heavier than the demon, the demon had to stop his forée and
could go no further.

PURPORT

Here is a competition in yogic power between Krsna and Trnavar-
tasura. By practicing mystic yoga, asuras generally attain some perfec-
tion in the eight siddhis, or perfections, namely anima, laghima,
mahima, prapti, prakamya, iSitva, vasitva and kamavasayita. But al-
though a demon may acquire such powers to a very limited extent, he
cannot compete with the mystic power of Krsna, for Krsna is Yogeévara,
the source of all mystic power (yatra yogesvaro harih). No one can com-
pete with Krsna. Sometimes, of course, having acquired a fragmental
portion of Krsna’s mystic power, asuras demonstrate their power to the
foolish public and assert themselves to be God, not knowing that God is
the supreme ४०६८६९४8. Here also we see that Trnavarta assumed the
mahima-siddhi and took Krsna away as if Krsna were an ordinary child.
But Krsna also became a mystic mahima-siddha. When mother Yasoda
was carrying Him, He became so heavy that His mother, who was usually
accustomed to carrying Him, could not bear Him and had to place Him
down on the ground. Thus Trpavarta had been able to take Krsna away
in the presence of mother 36003. But when Krsna, high in the sky,
assumed the mahima-siddhi, the demon, unable to go further, was
obliged to stop his force and come down according to Krsna’s desire. One
should not, therefore, compete with Krsna’s mystic power.

Devotees automatically have all mystic power, but they do not like to
compete with Krsna. Instead, they fully surrender to Krsna, and their
yogic power is demonstrated by Krsna’s mercy. Devotees can show
mystic yoga so powerful that a demon could not even dream of it, but
they never try to demonstrate it for their personal sense gratification.


--- Page 74 ---
68 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 10, Ch. 7
Whatever they do is for the service of the Lord, and therefore they are
always in a position superior to that of the demons. There are many
karmis, yogis and janis who artificially try to compete with Krsna, and
thus ordinary, foolish people who do not care to hear Srimad-
Bhagavatam from authorities consider some rascal yogi to be Bhagavan,
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. At the present moment there are
many so-called babas who present themselves as incarnations of God by
showing some insignificant mystic wonder, and foolish people regard
them as God because of lacking knowledge of Krsna.

Because of Krsna’s weight, Trnavarta considered Him to be like
a great mountain or a hunk of iron. But because Krsna had caught
the demon’s neck, the demon was unable to throw Him off. He
therefore thought of the child as wonderful, since he could
neither bear the child nor cast aside the burden.
PURPORT
Trnavarta intended to take Krsna up in the sky and kill Him, but
Krsna enjoyed the pastime of riding on Trpavarta’s body and traveling

for a while in the sky. Thus Trpavarta’s attempt to kill Krsna failed,
while Krsna, ananda-cinmaya-rasa-vigraha, enjoyed this pastime. Now,
since Trnavarta was falling because of Krsna’s heaviness, he wanted to
save himself by throwing Krsna off from his neck, but was unable to do
so because Krsna held him very tightly. Consequently, this would be the
last time for Trpavarta’s yogic power. Now he was going to die by the
arrangement of Krsna.

TRANSLATION
The gopis immediately picked Krsna up from the chest of the
demon and delivered Him, free from all inauspiciousness, to
mother Yasoda. Because the child, although taken into the sky by
the demon, was unhurt and now free from all danger and misfor-
tune, the gopis and cowherd men, headed by Nanda Maharaja,
were extremely happy.
PURPORT
The demon fell flat from the sky, and Krsna was playing on his chest
very happily, uninjured and free from misfortune. Not at all disturbed
because of being taken high in the sky by the demon, Krsna was playing
and enjoying. This is ananda-cinmaya-rasa-vigraha. In any condition,
Krsna is sac-cid-ananda-vigraha. He has no unhappiness. Others might
have thought that He was in difficulty, but because the demon’s chest
was sufficiently broad to play on, the baby was happy in all respects. It
was most astonishing that although the demon went so high in the sky,
the child did not fall down. Therefore, the child had been saved virtually

from the mouth of death. Now that He was saved, all the inhabitants of
Vrndavana were happy.

is wonderfully astonishing; esah—this (child); raksasa—by the man-
eating demon; balah—the innocent child Krsna; nivrttim—taken away
just to be killed and eaten; gamitah—went away; abhyagat punah—but
He has come back again unhurt; himsrah—one who is envious; sva-
papena—because of his own sinful activities; vihirmsitah—now (that

sadhuh—any person who is innocent and free from sinful life;
samatvena—being equal to everyone; bhayat—from all kinds of fear;

TRANSLATION
It is most astonishing that although this innocent child was
taken away by the Riksasa to be eaten, He has returned without
having been killed or even injured. Because this demon was en-
vious, cruel and sinful, he has been killed for his own sinful ac-
tivities. This is the law of nature. An innocent devotee is always
protected by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and a sinful
person is always vanquished for his sinful life.
PURPORT
Krsna conscious life means innocent devotional life, and a sadhu 15 one
who is fully devoted to Krsna. As confirmed by Krsna in Bhagavad-gita


--- Page 79 ---
Text 32] The Killing of the Demon Trnavarta 73
(9.30), bhajate mari ananya-bhak sadhur eva sa mantavyah: anyone
fully attached to Krsna is a sadhu. Nanda Maharaja and the gopis and
other cowherd men could not understand that Krsna was the Supreme
Personality of Godhead playing as a human child and that His life was
not in danger under any circumstances. Rather, because of their intense
parental love for Krsna, they thought that Krsna was an innocent child
and had been saved by the Supreme Lord.

In the material world, because of intense lust and desire for enjoy-
ment, one becomes implicated in sinful life more and more (kama esa
krodha esa rajo-guna-samudbhavah). Therefore the quality of fear is
one of the aspects of material life (ahara-nidra-bhaya-maithunam ca).
But if one becomes Krsna conscious, the process of devotional service,
$ravanarh kirtanam, diminishes one’s polluted life of material existence,
and one is purified and protected by the Supreme Personality of God-
head. Srnvatam sva-kathah krsnah punya-$ravana-kirtanah. In devo-
tional life, one has faith in this process. Such faith is one of the six kinds
of surrender. Raksisyatiti visvasah (Hari-bhakti-vilasa 11.676). One of
the processes of surrender is that one should simply depend on Krsna,
convinced that He will give one all protection. That Krsna will protect
His devotee is a fact, and Nanda Maharaja and the other inhabitants of
Vrndavana accepted this very simply, although they did not know that
the Supreme Lord Himself was present before them. There have been
many instances in which a devotee like Prahlada Maharaja or Dhruva
Maharaja has been put in difficulty even by his father but has been saved
under all circumstances. Therefore our only business is to become Krsna
conscious and depend fully on Krsna for all protection.

TRANSLATION

Nanda Maharaja and the others said: We must previously have
performed austerities for a very long time, worshiped the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, performed pious activities for
public life, constructing public roads and wells, and also given
charity, as a result of which this boy, although faced with death,
has returned to give happiness to His relatives.

PURPORT

Nanda Maharaja confirmed that by pious activities one can become a
sadhu so that one will be happy at home and one’s children will be pro-
tected. In Sastra there are many injunctions for karmis and jianis, es-
pecially for karmis, by which they can become pious and happy even in
material life. According to Vedic civilization, one should perform ac-
tivities for the benefit of the public, such as constructing public roads,
planting trees on both sides of the road so that people can walk in the
shade, and constructing public wells so that everyone can take water
without difficulty. One should perform austerity to control one’s desires,
and one must simultaneously worship the Supreme Personality of God-
head. Thus one becomes pious, and as a result one is happy even in
material conditions of life.

TRANSLATION

O King Pariksit, when the child Krsna was almost finished
drinking His mother’s milk and mother Yasoda was touching Him
and looking at His beautiful, brilliantly smiling face, the baby
yawned, and mother Ya$oda saw in His mouth the whole sky, the
higher planetary system and the earth, the luminaries in all direc-
tions, the sun, the moon, fire, air, the seas, islands, moun-
tains, rivers, forests, and all kinds of living entities, moving and
nonmoving.

PURPORT

By the arrangement of yogamayd, Krsna’s pastimes with mother
Yasoda were all regarded as ordinary. So here was an opportunity for
Krsna to show His mother that the whole universe is situated within
Him. In His small form, Krsna was kind enough to show His mother the
virat-ripa, the universal form, so that she could enjoy seeing what kind
of child she had on her lap. The rivers have been mentioned here as the
daughters of the mountains (nagams tad-duhitrh). It is the flowing of the
rivers that makes big forests possible. There are living entities every-
where, some of them moving and some of them not moving. No place is
vacant. This is a special feature of God’s creation.

TRANSLATION
When mother 08800 8 saw the whole universe within the mouth
of her child, her heart began to throb, and in astonishment she
wanted to close her restless eyes.
PURPORT
Because of her pure maternal love, mother 36003 thought that this
wonderful child playing so many tricks must have had some disease. She
did not appreciate the wonders shown by her child; rather, she wanted to
close her eyes. She was expecting another danger, and therefore her eyes
became restless like those of a deer cub. This was all the arrangement of
yogamadya. The relationship between mother Yasoda and Krsna is one of
pure maternal love. In that love, mother 38008 did not very much ap-
preciate the display of the Supreme Personality of Godhead’s opulences.
At the beginning of this chapter, two extra verses sometimes appear:
evam bahini karmani
gopanam sam sa-yositam
nandasya gehe vavrdhe
kurvan visnu-janardanah
“In this way, to chastise and kill the demons, the child Krsna demon-
strated many activities in the house of Nanda Maharaja, and the inhabi-
tants of Vraja enjoyed these incidents.”
evam sa vavrdhe visnur
nanda-gehe janardanah
kurvann anisam anandamn
gopalanarh sa-yositam
“To increase the transcendental pleasure of the gopas and the gopis,
Krsna, the killer of all demons, was thus raised by His father and
mother, Nanda and Yasoda.”


--- Page 85 ---
Text 37] The Killing of the Demon Trnavarta 79
Sripada Vijayadhvaja Tirtha also adds another verse after the third
verse in this chapter:
vistareneha karunyat
sarva-papa-pranasanam
vaktum arhasi dharma-jia
dayalus tvam iti prabho
“‘Pariksit Maharaja then requested Sukadeva Gosvami to continue speak-
ing such narrations about the pastimes of Krsna, so that the King could
enjoy from them transcendental bliss.”
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Tenth Canto, Seventh
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “The Killing of the Demon
Trnavarta.”

CHAPTER EIGHT
Lord Krsna Shows
the Universal Form Within His Mouth
The summary of the Eighth Chapter is as follows. This chapter describes
the ceremony of giving a name to Krsna. It also describes His crawling,
His playing with the cows, and His eating earth and again showing the
universal form to His mother.

One day, Vasudeva sent for Gargamuni, the family priest of the yadu-
vari$a, and thus Gargamuni went to the house of Nanda Maharaja, who
received him very well and requested him to give names to Krsna and
Balarama. Gargamuni, of course, reminded Nanda Maharaja that Karnsa
was looking for the son of Devaki and said that if he performed the
ceremony very gorgeously, the ceremony would come to the notice of
1697158, who would then suspect that Krsna was the son of Devaki. Nanda
Maharaja therefore requested Gargamuni to perform this ceremony
without anyone’s knowledge, and Gargamuni did so. Because Balarama,
the son of Rohini, increases the transcendental bliss of others, His name
is Rama, and because of His extraordinary strength, He is called
Baladeva. He attracts the Yadus to follow His instructions, and therefore
His name is Sankarsana. Krsna, the son of १३६०१, previously appeared
in many other colors, such as white, red and yellow, and He had now
assumed the color black. Because He was sometimes the son of Vasudeva,
His name is Vasudeva. According to His various activities and qualities,
He has many other names. After thus informing Nanda Maharaja and
completing the name-giving ceremony, Gargamuni advised Nanda
Maharaja to protect his son very carefully and then departed.

Sukadeva Gosvami next described how the two children crawled,
walked on Their small legs, played with the cows and calves, stole butter
and other milk products and broke the butter pots. In this way, he de-
scribed many naughty activities of Krsna and Balarama. The most won-
derful of these occurred when Krsna’s playmates complained to mother
Yasoda that Krsna was eating earth. Mother Yasoda wanted to open

81


--- Page 87 ---
82 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 10, Ch. 8
Krsna’s mouth to see the evidence so that she could chastise Him. Some-
times she assumed the position of a chastising mother, and at the next
moment she was overwhelmed with maternal love. After describing all
this to Maharaja Pariksit, Sukadeva Gosvami, at Maharaja Pariksit’s re-
quest, praised the fortune of mother Yasoda and Nanda. Nanda and
Yasoda were formerly Drona and Dhara, and by the order of Brahma
they came to this earth and had the Supreme Personality of Godhead as
their son.

PURPORT
As factually stated by Nanda Maharaja, Gargamuni, being a devotee,
had no needs. Similarly, when Krsna comes He has no needs, for He is
purna, atmarama. Nonetheless, He descends to this material world to
protect the devotees and vanquish miscreants (paritranaya sadhinari
vinasaya ca duskrtam). This is the mission of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, and devotees also have the same mission. One who executes


--- Page 90 ---
Text 5] Lord Krsna Shows the Universal Form 85
this mission of para-upakara, performing welfare activities for people in
general, is recognized by Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as
being very, very dear to Him (na ca tasman manusyesu kascin me priya-
krttamah). Similarly, Caitanya Mahaprabhu has advised this para-
upakara, and He has especially advised the inhabitants of India:
bharata-bhiimite haila manusya-janma ydara
Jjanma sarthaka kari’ kara para-upakara
“One who has taken his birth as a human being in the land of India
[Bharatavarsa] should make his life successful and work for the benefit
of all other people.” (Cc. Adi. 9.41) On the whole, the duty of a pure
Vaisnava devotee is to act for the welfare of others.

Nanda Maharaja could understand that Gargamuni had come for this
purpose and that his own duty now was to act according to Gargamuni’s
advice. Thus he said, “Please tell me what is my duty.” This should be
the attitude of everyone, especially the householder. The varnasrama
society is organized into eight divisions: brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya,
ऽद्वा, brahmacarya, grhastha, vanaprastha and sannyasa. Nanda
Maharaja represented himself as grhinam, a householder. A brahmacart
factually has no needs, but grhi, householders, are engaged in sense
gratification. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (2.44), bhogaisvarya-prasak-
tanam tayapahrta-cetasam. Everyone has come to this material world for
sense gratification, and the position of those who are too attached to sense
gratification and who therefore accept the grhastha-asrama is very pre-
carious. Since everyone in this material world is searching for sense
gratification, grhasthas are required to be trained as mahat, great
mahatmas. Therefore Nanda Maharaja specifically used the word
mahad-vicalanam. Gargamuni had no interest to serve by going to
Nanda Maharaja, but Nanda Maharaja, as a grhastha, was always per-
fectly ready to receive instructions from a mahdatma to gain the real
benefit in life. Thus he was ready to execute Gargamuni’s order.

TRANSLATION

O great saintly person, you have compiled the astrological
knowledge by which one can understand past and present unseen
things. By the strength of this knowledge, any human being can
understand what he has done in his past life and how it affects his
present life. This is known to you.

PURPORT

The word “destiny” 15 now defined. Unintelligent persons who do not
understand the meaning of life are just like animals. Animals do not
know the past, present and future of life, nor are they able to understand
it. But a human being can understand this, if he is sober. Therefore, as
stated in Bhagavad-gita (2.13), dhiras tatra na muhyati: a sober person
is not bewildered. The simple truth is that although life is eternal, in this
material world one changes from one body to another. Foolish people, es-
pecially in this age, do not understand this simple truth. Krsna says:

dehino ’smin yatha dehe
kaumararm yauvanam jara
tatha dehantara-praptir
dhiras tatra na muhyati


--- Page 92 ---
Text 6] Lord Krsna Shows the Universal Form 87
‘As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to
youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. The
self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change.” (Bg. 2.13) Krsna,
the greatest authority, says that the body will change. And as soon as the
body changes, one’s whole program of work changes also. Today I am a
human being or a great personality, but with a little deviation from
nature’s law, I shall have to accept a different type of body. Today I am a
human being, but tomorrow I may become a dog, and then whatever ac-
tivities I have performed in this life will be a failure. This simple truth is
now rarely understood, but one who is a dhira can understand this.
Those in this material world for material enjoyment should know that
because their present position will cease to exist, they must be careful in
how they act. This is also stated by Rsabhadeva. Na sadhu manye yata
atmano yam asann api klesada asa dehah (Bhag. 5.5.4). Although this
body is temporary, as long as we have to live in this body we must suffer.
Whether one has a short life or a long life, one must suffer the threefold
miseries of material life. Therefore any gentleman, dhira, must be in-
terested in jyotisa, astrology.

Nanda Maharaja was trying to take advantage of the opportunity
afforded by Gargamuni’s presence, for Gargamuni was a great authority
in this knowledge of astrology, by which one can see the unseen events of
past, present and future. It is the duty of a father to understand the
astrological position of his children and do what is needed for their hap-
piness. Now, taking advantage of the opportunity afforded by the pres-
ence of Gargamuni, Nanda Maharaja suggested that Gargamuni prepare
a horoscope for Nanda’s two sons, Krsna and Balarama.

brahmanah); sresthah—you are the best; sarmskaran—ceremonies per-
formed for reformation (because by these reformatory activities one
takes one’s second birth: samskdarad bhaved dvijah); kartum arhasi—

TRANSLATION

My lord, you are the best of the brahmanas, especially because
you are fully aware of the jyotih-sastra, the astrological science.
Therefore you are naturally the spiritual master of every human
being. This being so, since you have kindly come to my house,
kindly execute the reformatory activities for my two sons.

PURPORT

The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, says in Bhagavad-gita
(4.13), catur-varnyam maya srstam guna-karma-vibhagasah: the four
varnas— brahmana, ksatriya, vaiSya and Sidra—must be present in
society. The brahmanas are required for the guidance of the whole
society. If there is no such institution as varndsrama-dharma and if
human society has no such guide as the brahmana, human society will be
hellish. In Kali-yuga, especially at the present moment, there is no such
thing as a real brahmana, and therefore society is in a chaotic condition.
Formerly there were qualified brahmanas, but at present, although there
are certainly persons who think themselves brahmanas, they actually
have no ability to guide society. The Krsna consciousness movement is
therefore very much eager to reintroduce the varndsrama system into
human society so that those who are bewildered or less intelligent will be -
able to take guidance from qualified brahmanas.

Brahmana means Vaisnava. After one becomes a brahmana, the next
stage of development in human society is to become a Vaisnava. People
*The sastras enjoin, tad-vijiandrtham sa gurum evabhigacchet (Mundaka Upan-
isad 1.2.12). It is the duty of everyone to approach a brahmana as the guru.

Text 7] Lord Krsna Shows the Universal Form 89
in general must be guided to the destination or goal of life, and therefore
they must understand Visnu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The
whole system of Vedic knowledge is based on this principle, but people
have lost the clue (na te viduh svartha-gatir hi visnum), and they are
simply pursuing sense gratification, with the risk of gliding down to a
lower grade of life (mrtyu-samsara-vartmani). It doesn’t matter whether
one is born a brahmana or not. No one is born a brahmana; everyone is
born a Sidra. But by the guidance of a brahmana and by sariskara, one
can become dvija, twice-born, and then gradually become a brahmana.
Brahmanism is not a system meant to create a monopoly for a particular
class of men. Everyone should be educated so as to become a brahmana.
At least there must be an opportunity to allow everyone to attain the
destination of life. Regardless of whether one is born in a brahmana
family, a ksatriya family or a Sidra family, one may be guided by a
proper brahmana and be promoted to the highest platform of being a
Vaisnava. Thus the Krsna consciousness movement affords an oppor-
tunity to develop the right destiny for human society. Nanda Maharaja
took advantage of the opportunity of Gargamuni’s presence by request-
ing him to perform the necessary reformatory activities for his sons to
guide Them toward the destination of life.

TRANSLATION
Gargamuni said: My dear Nanda Maharaja, I am the priestly
guide of the Yadu dynasty. This is known everywhere. Therefore,
if I perform the purificatory process for your sons, Karhsa will
consider Them the sons of Devaki.
PURPORT
Gargamuni indirectly disclosed that Krsna was the son of Devaki, not
of Yasoda. Since Karisa was already searching for Krsna, if the
purificatory process were undertaken by Gargamuni, Karhsa might be in-
formed, and that would create a catastrophe. It may be argued that al-
though Gargamuni was the priest of the Yadu dynasty, Nanda Maharaja
also belonged to that dynasty. Nanda Maharaja, however, was not acting
as 8 ksatriya. Therefore Gargamuni said, “If I act as your priest, this will
confirm that Krsna is the son of Devaki.”

TRANSLATION

Karhsa is both a great diplomat and a very sinful man.
Therefore, having heard from Yogamaya, the daughter of Devaki,
that the child who will kill him has already been born somewhere
else, having heard that the eighth pregnancy of Devaki could not
bring forth a female child, and having understood your friendship
with Vasudeva, 87088, upon hearing that the purificatory process
has been performed by me, the priest of the Yadu dynasty, may
certainly consider all these points and suspect that Krsna is the son
of Devaki and Vasudeva. Then he might take steps to kill Krsna.
That would be a catastrophe.

PURPORT

Kamisa knew very well that Yogamaya was, after all, the maidservant
of Krsna and Visnu and that although Yogamaya had appeared as the
daughter of Devaki, she might have been forbidden to disclose this fact.
Actually this was what had happened. Gargamuni argued very soberly
that his taking part in performing the reformatory process for Krsna
would give rise to many doubts, so that Karhsa might take very severe
steps to kill the child. Kamsa had already sent many demons to attempt to
kill this child, but none of them had survived. If Gargamuni were to per-
form the purificatory process, Karisa’s suspicions would be fully con-
firmed, and he would take very severe steps. Gargamuni gave this
warning to Nanda Maharaja.

TRANSLATION
Nanda Maharaja said: My dear great sage, if you think that your
performing this process of purification will make Karisa
suspicious, then secretly chant the Vedic hymns and perform the
purifying process of second birth here in the cow shed of my
house, without the knowledge of anyone else, even my relatives,
for this process of purification is essential.
PURPORT
Nanda Maharaja did not like the idea of avoiding the purificatory pro-
cess. Despite the many obstacles, he wanted to take advantage of
Gargamuni’s presence and do what was needed. The purificatory process
is essential specifically for brahmanas, ksatriyas and vaisyas. Therefore,
since Nanda Maharaja presented himself as a vaiSya, this process of
purification was essential. Formerly, such institutional activities were
compulsory. Catur-varnyarh maya = अका, guna-karma-vibhagasah


--- Page 98 ---
Text 11] Lord Krsna Shows the Universal Form 93
(Bg. 4.13). Without these activities of purification, the society would be
considered a society of animals. To take advantage of Gargamuni’s pres-
ence, Nanda Maharaja wanted to perform the nama-karana ceremonies,
even secretly, without any gorgeous arrangements. Therefore, the oppor-
tunity for purification should be regarded as the essential duty of human
society. In Kali-yuga, however, people have forgotten the essence. Man-
dah sumanda-matayo manda-bhagya hy upadrutah (Bhag. 1.1.10). In
this age, people are all bad and unfortunate, and they do not accept Vedic
instructions to make their life successful. Nanda Maharaja, however, did
not want to neglect anything. To keep intact a happy society advanced in
spiritual knowledge, he took full advantage of Gargamuni’s presence to
do what was necessary. How degraded society has become within five
thousand years. Mandah sumanda-matayo manda-bhagyah. The human
life is obtained after many, many millions of births, and it is intended for
purification. Previously, a father was eager to give all kinds of help to
elevate his children, but at present, because of being misguided, people
are prepared even to kill to avoid the responsibility of raising children.

Bala. Moreover, because He unites two families—Vasudeva’s
family and the family of Nanda Maharaja—He will be known as
Sankarsana.
PURPORT

Baladeva was actually the son of Devaki, but He was transferred from
Devaki’s womb to that of Rohini. This fact was not disclosed. According
to a statement in the Hari-vamsa:

pratyuvdca tato ramah
sarvams tan abhitah sthitan
yadavesv api sarvesu
bhavanto mama vallabhah
Gargamuni did disclose to Nanda Maharaja that Balarama would be
known as Sankarsana because of uniting two families—the yadu-varmsa
and the vamsa of Nanda Maharaja—one of which was known as ksatriya
and the other as vaiSya. Both families had the same original forefather,
the only difference being that Nanda Maharaja was born of a vaiSya wife
whereas Vasudeva was born of a ksatriya wife. Later, Nanda Maharaja
married a vaiSya wife, and Vasudeva married a ksatriya wife. So al-
though the families of Nanda Maharaja and Vasudeva both came from
the same father, they were divided as ksatriya and vaisya. Now Baladeva
united them, and therefore He was known as Sankarsana.

transcendental bodies according to the different yugas; Suklah—
sometimes white; raktah—sometimes red; tatha—as well as; pitah—
sometimes yellow; idanim krsnatam gatah—at the present moment He
has assumed a blackish color.

TRANSLATION

Your son Krsna appears as an incarnation in every millennium.
In the past, He assumed three different colors— white, red and
yellow —and now He has appeared in a blackish color. [In another
Dvapara-yuga, He appeared (as Lord Ramacandra) in the color of
Suka, a parrot. All such incarnations have now assembled in
Krsna.]

PURPORT

Partially explaining the position of Lord Krsna and partially covering
the facts, Gargamuni indicated, ‘Your son is a great personality, and He
can change the color of His body in different ages.” The word grhnatah
indicates that Krsna is free to make His choice. In other words, He is the
Supreme Personality of Godhead and may therefore do whatever He
desires. In Vedic literature the different colors assumed by the Per-
sonality of Godhead in different millenniums are stated, and therefore
when Gargamuni said, “Your son has assumed these colors,” he in-
directly said, “He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.” Because of
Karnsa’s atrocities, Gargamuni tried to avoid disclosing this fact, but he
indirectly informed Nanda Maharaja that Krsna, his son, was the
Supreme Personality of Godhead.

It may be noted that Srila Jiva Gosvami, in his book Krama-san-
darbha, has enunciated the purport of this verse. In every millennium,
Krsna appears in a different form, either as white, red or yellow, but this
time He personally appeared in His original, blackish form and, as pre-
dicted by Gargamuni, exhibited the power of Narayana. Because in this
form the Supreme Personality of Godhead exhibits Himself fully, His
name is Sri Krsna, the all-attractive.

Factually, Krsna is the source of all avataras, and therefore all the dif-
ferent features of the different avatdras are present in Krsna. When
Krsna incarnates, all the features of other incarnations are already pres-


--- Page 102 ---
Text 13] Lord Krsna Shows the Universal Form 97
ent within Him. Other incarnations are partial representations of Krsna,
who is the full-fledged incarnation of the Supreme Being. It is to be
understood that the Supreme Being, whether appearing as sukla, rakta or
pita (white, red or yellow), is the same person. When He appears in dif-
ferent incarnations, He appears in different colors, just like the
sunshine, which contains seven colors. Sometimes the colors of sunshine
are represented separately; otherwise the sunshine is observed mainly as
bright light. The different avataras, such as the manvantara-avataras,
lila-avataras and dasa-avatdras, are all included in the krsna-avatara.
When Krsna appears, all the avataras appear with Him. As described in
Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.3.26):
avatara hy asankhyeya
hareh sattva-nidher dvijah
yathavidasinah kulyah
sarasah syuh sahasrasah

The avatdras incessantly appear, like incessantly flowing water. No one
can count how many waves there are in flowing water, and similarly
there is no limitation of the avataras. And Krsna is the full representa-
tion of all avataras because He is the source of all avataras. Krsna is
ari$i, whereas others are arisa, part of Krsna. All living entities, includ-
ing us, are amsas (mamaivarso Jjwa-loke jiva-bhitah sandtanah). These
amsas are of different magnitude. Human beings (who are minute
aridas) and the demigods, visnu-tattva and all other living beings are all
part of the Supreme. Nityo nityanam cetanas cetananam (Katha
Upanisad 2.2.13). Krsna is the full representation of all living entities,
and when Krsna is present, all avatdras are included in Him.

The Eleventh Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam describes the incarnations
for each yuga in chronological order. The Bhagavatam says, krte suklas
catur-bahuh, tretayarm rakta-varno sau, dvapare bhagavan syamah and
krsna-varnar tvisakrsnam. We actually see that in Kali-yuga, Bhagavan
has appeared in pita-varna, or a yellow color, as Gaurasundara, although
the Bhagavatam speaks of krsna-varnam. To adjust all these statements,
one should understand that although in some yugas some of the colors
are prominent, in every yuga, whenever Krsna appears, all the colors are


--- Page 103 ---
98 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 10, Ch. 8
present. Krsna-varnarh tvisakrsnam: although Caitanya Mahaprabhu ap-
pears without krsna, or a blackish color, He is understood to be Krsna
Himself. [00707 krsnatari gatah. The same original Krsna who appears
in different varnas has now appeared. The word dsan indicates that He is
always present. Whenever the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears
in His full feature, He is understood to be krsna-varnam, although He
appears in different colors. Prahlada Maharaja states that Caitanya Maha-
prabhu is channa; that is, although He is Krsna, He is covered by a
yellow color. Thus the Gaudiya Vaisnavas accept the conclusion that al-
though Caitanya Mahaprabhu appeared in pita color, He is Krsna.

For this son of yours there are many forms and names according

Bahiini: the Lord has many names. Advaitam acyutam anadim
ananta-ripam adyam purana-purusari nava-yauvanar ca. As stated in
the Brahma-sarihita (5.33), the Lord is one, but He has many forms and
many names. It was not that because Gargamuni gave the child the name
Krsna, that was His only name. He has other names, such as Bhakta-
vatsala, Giridhari, Govinda and Gopala. If we analyze the nirukti, or se-
mantic derivation, of the word “Krsna,” we find that na signifies that He
stops the repetition of birth and death, and krs means sattartha, or
“existence.” (Krsna is the whole of existence.) Also, krs means
“attraction,” and na means ananda, or “bliss.” Krsna is known as
Mukunda because He wants to give everyone spiritual, eternal, blissful

life. Unfortunately, because of the living entity’s little independence, the
living entity wants to ‘“‘deprogram” the program of Krsna. This is the
material disease. Nonetheless, because Krsna wants to give transcenden-
tal bliss to the living entities, He appears in various forms. Therefore He
is called Krsna. Because Gargamuni was an astrologer, he knew what
others did not know. Yet Krsna has so many names that even Gargamuni
did not know them all. It is to be concluded that Krsna, according to His
transcendental activities, has many names and many forms.

favorable to the brahmanas and the cows. His first business is to give all
comfort to the cows and the brahmanas. In fact, comfort for the

name, fame and influence, He is exactly like Narayana. You should
all raise this child very carefully and cautiously.

PURPORT

In this verse, the word narayana-samah is significant. Narayana has
no equal. He is asamaurdhva: no one is equal to Him, and no one is
greater than He is. As stated in Sastra:
yas tu nar@yanam devam
brahma-rudradi-daivataih
samatvenaiva vikseta
sa pasandi bhaved dhruvam

One who equates Narayana even with great exalted demigods like Lord
Siva or Lord Brahma is a pasandi, an agnostic. No one can equal
Narayana. Nonetheless, Gargamuni used the word sama, meaning
“‘equal,” because he wanted to treat Krsna as the Supreme Personality of
Godhead who had become Nanda Maharaja’s son. Gargamuni wanted to
impress upon the mind of Nanda Maharaja, “Your worshipable Deity,
Narayana, is so pleased with you that He has sent you a son almost equal
to Him in qualifications. Therefore you may designate your son with a
similar name, such as Mukunda or Madhusiidana. But you must always
remember that whenever you want to do something very good, there will
be many hindrances. Therefore you should raise and protect this child
with great care. If you can protect this child very cautiously, as Narayana
always protects you, the child will be as good as Narayana.” Gargamuni
also indicated that although the child was exaltedly qualified like
Narayana, He would enjoy more than Narayana as rdsa-vihari, the
central enjoyer of the rasa dance. As stated in the Brahma-sarihita,
laksmi-sahasra-$ata-sambhrama-sevyamanam: He would be served by
many gopis, who would all be as good as the goddess of fortune.

Srila Sukadeva Gosvami continued: After Gargamuni, having

full of all good fortune.
PURPORT
Krsna is the Supersoul, and Nanda Maharaja is the individual soul. By
the instructions of Gargamuni, both of them were blessed. Nanda
Maharaja was thinking of Krsna’s safety from the hands of demons like
Pitana and Sakatasura, and because he possessed such a son, he thought
of himself as most fortunate.

TRANSLATION
After a short time passed, both brothers, Rama and Krsna,
began to crawl on the ground of Vraja with the strength of Their
hands and knees and thus enjoy Their childhood play.
PURPORT
One brahmana devotee says:
Srutim apare smrtim itare bharatam anye bhajantu bhava-bhitah
aham iha nandar vande yasyalinde param brahma
“Let others, fearing material existence, worship the Vedas, the Vedic
supplementary Puranas and the Mahabharata, but 1 shall worship
Nanda Maharaja, in whose courtyard the Supreme Brahman is crawl-
ing.” For a highly exalted devotee, kaivalya, merging into the existence
of the Supreme, appears no better than hell (rarakayate). But here one
can simply think of the crawling of Krsna and Balarama in the courtyard
of Nanda Maharaja and always merge in transcendental happiness. As
long as one is absorbed in thoughts of krsna-lila, especially Krsna’s
childhood pastimes, as Pariksit Maharaja desired to be, one is
always merged in actual kaivalya. Therefore Vyasadeva compiled
Srimad-Bhagavatam. Lokasydjanato vidvams cakre satvata-samhitam
(Bhag. 1.7.6). Vyasadeva compiled Srimad-Bhagavatam, under the in-
struction of Narada, so that anyone can take advantage of this literature,
think of Krsna’s pastimes and always be liberated.

TRANSLATION
When Krsna and Balarama, with the strength of Their legs,
crawled in the muddy places created in Vraja by cow dung and cow
urine, Their crawling resembled the crawling of serpents, and the
sound of Their ankle bells was very charming. Very much pleased
by the sound of other people’s ankle bells, They used to follow
these people as if going to Their mothers, but when They saw that
these were other people, They became afraid and returned to
Their real mothers, YaSoda and Rohini.
PURPORT
When Krsna and Balarama were crawling about Vrajabhiimi, They
were enchanted by the sound of ankle bells. Thus They sometimes
followed other people, who would enjoy the crawling of Krsna and
Balarama and exclaim, 00, see how Krsna and Balarama are crawling!”
Upon hearing this, Krsna and Balarama could understand that these were
not Their mothers They were following, and They would return to Their
actual mothers. Thus the crawling of Krsna and Balarama was enjoyed by

the people of the neighborhood, as well as by mother Yasoda and Rohini
and the two children Themselves.

Dressed with muddy earth mixed with cow dung and cow urine,
the babies looked very beautiful, and when They went to Their
mothers, both Yasoda and Rohini picked Them up with great affec-
tion, embraced Them and allowed Them to suck the milk flowing
from their breasts. While sucking the breast, the babies smiled,
and Their small teeth were visible. Their mothers, upon seeing
those beautiful teeth, enjoyed great transcendental bliss.


--- Page 113 ---
108 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 10, Ch. 8
PURPORT

As the mothers cared for their respective babies, by the arrangement
of yogamaya the babies thought, ‘Here is My mother,” and the mothers
thought, ‘Here is my son.” Because of affection, milk naturally flowed
from the mothers’ breasts, and the babies drank it. When the mothers
saw small teeth coming in, they would count them and be happy, and
when the babies saw Their mothers allowing Them to drink their breast
milk, the babies also felt transcendental pleasure. As this transcendental
affection continued between Rohini and Balarama and Ya$oda and Krsna,
they all enjoyed transcendental bliss.

Within the house of Nanda Maharaja, the cowherd ladies would

babies would catch the ends of the calves’ tails, and the calves
would drag Them here and there. When the ladies saw these
pastimes, they certainly stopped their household activities and
laughed and enjoyed the incidents.
PURPORT
While crawling in curiosity, Krsna and Balarama would sometimes
catch the ends of the tails of calves. The calves, feeling that someone had
caught them, would begin to flee here and there, and the babies would
hold on very tightly, being afraid of how the calves were moving. The
calves, seeing that the babies were holding them tightly, would also be-
come afraid. Then the ladies would come to rescue the babies and gladly
laugh. This was their enjoyment.

TRANSLATION

‘When mother YaSoda and Rohini were unable to protect the
babies from calamities threatened by horned cows, by fire, by
animals with claws and teeth such as monkeys, dogs and cats, and
by thorns, swords and other weapons on the ground, they were al-
ways in anxiety, and their household engagements were disturbed.
At that time, they were fully equipoised in the transcendental
ecstasy known as the distress of material affection, for this was
aroused within their minds.

PURPORT

All these pastimes of Krsna, and the great enjoyment exhibited by the
mothers, are transcendental; nothing about them is material. They are
described in the Brahma-sarihita as ananda-cinmaya-rasa. In the spiri-
tual world there is anxiety, there is crying, and there are other feelings
similar to those of the material world, but because the reality of these
feelings is in the transcendental world, of which this world is only an im-
itation, mother 36008 and Rohini enjoyed them transcendentally.

The word saha-ramah, meaning “‘along with Balarama,” is significant
in this verse. In such transcendental pastimes, Krsna is the chief hero,
and Balarama provides additional help.

and enjoyed the information given by the neighborhood friends.

TRANSLATION

“Our dear friend Yasoda, your son sometimes comes to our
houses before the milking of the cows and releases the calves, and
when the master of the house becomes angry, your son merely
smiles. Sometimes He devises some process by which He steals
palatable curd, butter and milk, which He then eats and drinks.
When the monkeys assemble, He divides it with them, and when
the monkeys have their bellies so full that they won’t take more,
He breaks the pots. Sometimes, if He gets no opportunity to steal
butter or milk from a house, He will be angry at the householders,
and for His revenge He will agitate the small children by pinching
them. Then, when the children begin crying, Krsna will go away.

PURPORT

The narration of Krsna’s naughty childhood activities would be pre-
sented to mother 36008 in the form of complaints. Sometimes Krsna
would enter the house of a neighbor, and if He found no one there, He
would release the calves before the time for the cows to be milked. The
calves are actually supposed to be released when their mothers are
milked, but Krsna would release them before that time, and naturally the
calves would drink all the milk from their mothers. When the cowherd
men saw this, they would chase Krsna and try to catch Him, saying,


--- Page 119 ---
114 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 10, Ch. 8
“Here is Krsna doing mischief,” but He would flee and enter another
house, where He would again devise some means to steal butter and curd.
Then the cowherd men would again try to capture Him, saying, “Here is
the butter thief. Better capture Him!” And they would be angry. But
Krsna would simply smile, and they would forget everything. Some-
times, in their presence, He would begin eating the curd and butter.
There was no need for Krsna to eat butter, since His belly was always
full, but He would try to eat it, or else He would break the pots and dis-
tribute the contents to the monkeys. In this way, Krsna was always
engaged in mischief-making. If in any house He could not find any but-
ter or curd to steal, He would go into a room and agitate the small
children sleeping there by pinching them, and when they cried He would
go away.

TRANSLATION

“When the milk and curd are kept high on a swing hanging
from the ceiling and Krsna and Balarama cannot reach it, They ar-
range to reach it by piling up various planks and turning upside
down the mortar for grinding spices. Being quite aware of the con-
tents of a pot, They pick holes in it. While the elderly gopis go
about their household affairs, Krsna and Balarama sometimes go
into a dark room, brightening the place with the valuable jewels
and ornaments on Their bodies and taking advantage of this light
by stealing.

PURPORT

Formerly, in every household, yogurt and butter were kept for use in
emergencies. But Krsna and Balarama would pile up planks so that They
could reach the pots and would then pick holes in the pots with Their
hands so that the contents would leak out and They could drink it. This
was another means for stealing butter and milk. When the butter and
milk were kept in a dark room, Krsna and Balarama would go there and
make the place bright with the valuable jewels on Their bodies. On the
whole, Krsna and Balarama engaged in stealing butter and milk from the
neighborhood houses in many ways.

TRANSLATION

“When Krsna is caught in His naughty activities, the master of
the house will say to Him, ‘Oh, You are a thief,” and artificially ex-
press anger at Krsna. Krsna will then reply, ‘I am not a thief. You
are a thief.” Sometimes, being angry, Krsna passes urine and stool
in a neat, clean place in our houses. But now, our dear friend
४४6०३, this expert thief is sitting before you like a very good
boy.” Sometimes all the gopis would look at Krsna sitting there,
His eyes fearful so that His mother would not chastise Him, and
when they saw Krsna’s beautiful face, instead of chastising Him
they would simply look upon His face and enjoy transcendental
bliss. Mother Yasoda would mildly smile at all this fun, and she
would not want to chastise her blessed transcendental child.

PURPORT

Krsna’s business in the neighborhood was not only to steal but some-
times to pass stool and urine in a neat, clean house. When caught by the
master of the house, Krsna would chastise him, saying, “You are a
thief.” Aside from being a thief in His childhood affairs, Krsna acted as
an expert thief when He was young by attracting young girls and enjoy-
ing them in the rasa dance. This is Krsna’s business. He is also violent, as


--- Page 122 ---
Text 32] Lord Krsna Shows the Universal Form 117
the killer of many demons. Although mundane people like nonviolence
and other such brilliant qualities, God, the Absolute Truth, being always
the same, is good in any activities, even so-called immoral activities like
stealing, killing and violence. Krsna is always pure, and He is always the
Supreme Absolute Truth. Krsna may do anything supposedly abominable
in material life, yet still He is attractive. Therefore His name is Krsna,
meaning “‘all-attractive.” This is the platform on which transcendental
loving affairs and service are exchanged. Because of the features of
Krsna’s face, the mothers were so attracted that they could not chastise
Him. Instead of chastising Him, they smiled and enjoyed hearing of
Krsna’s activities. Thus the gopis remained satisfied, and Krsna enjoyed
their happiness. Therefore another name of Krsna is Gopi-jana-vallabha
because He invented such activities to please the gopis.

TRANSLATION

One day while Krsna was playing with His small playmates, in-
cluding Balarama and other sons of the gopas, all His friends came
together and lodged a complaint to mother Yasoda. “Mother,” they
submitted, ‘Krsna has eaten earth.”

PURPORT
Here is another of Krsna’s transcendental activities invented to please
the gopis. First a complaint was lodged with mother Yasoda about Krsna’s
stealing, but mother Yasoda did not chastise Him. Now, in an attempt to
awaken mother Yasoda’s anger so that she would chastise Krsna, another
complaint was invented —that Krsna had eaten earth.

fearful, she spoke to her son as follows.

PURPORT
Mother Yasoda was agitated by Krsna’s restless misbehavior. Her
house was full of sweetmeats. Why then should the restless boy eat dirt
in a solitary place? Krsna replied, “My dear mother, they have plotted
together and lodged a complaint against Me so that you will punish Me.
My elder brother, Balarama, has joined them. Actually, I have not done
this. Take My words as true. Do not be angry and chastise Me.”

TRANSLATION

Lord Sri Krsna replied: My dear mother, I have never eaten dirt.
All My friends complaining against Me are liars. If you think they
are being truthful, you can directly look into My mouth and
examine it.

PURPORT

Krsna presented Himself as an innocent child to increase the transcen-
dental ecstasy of maternal affection. As described in the $astra, tadana-
bhayan mithyoktir vatsalya-rasa-posika. This means that sometimes a
small child speaks lies. For example, he may have stolen something or
eaten something and yet deny that he has done so. We ordinarily see this
in the material world, but in relation to Krsna it is different; such ac-
tivities are meant to endow the devotee with transcendental ecstasy. The
Supreme Personality of Godhead was playing as a liar and accusing all
the other devotees of being liars. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam
(10.12.11), krta-punya-pusijah: a devotee may attain such an ecstatic
position after many, many births of devotional service. Persons who have
amassed the results of a vast amount of pious activities can attain the
stage of associating with Krsna and playing with Him like ordinary play-
mates. One should not consider these transactions of transcendental ser-
vice to be untruthful accusations. One should never accuse such devotees
of being ordinary boys speaking lies, for they attained this stage of
associating with Krsna by great austerities (tapasa brahmacaryena
Samena ca damena ca).

TRANSLATION

Mother १०४६०१३ challenged Krsna, ‘If You have not eaten earth,
then open Your mouth wide.” When challenged by His mother in
this way, Krsna, the son of Nanda Maharaja and Yasoda, to exhibit
pastimes like a human child, opened His mouth. Although the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, who is full of all opu-
lences, did not disturb His mother’s parental affection, His opu-
lence was automatically displayed, for Krsna’s opulence is never
lost at any stage, but is manifest at the proper time.

PURPORT

Without disturbing the ecstasy of His mother’s affection, Krsna
opened His mouth and displayed His own natural opulences. When a per-
son is given varieties of food, there may be a hundred and one varieties,
but if one likes ordinary $aka, spinach, he prefers to eat that. Similarly,
although Krsna was full of opulences, now, by the order of mother
Yasoda, He opened wide His mouth like a human child and did not
neglect the transcendental humor of maternal affection.

TRANSLATION

When Krsna opened His mouth wide by the order of mother
Yasoda, she saw within His mouth all moving and nonmoving en-
tities, outer space, and all directions, along with mountains, is-
lands, oceans, the surface of the earth, the blowing wind, fire, the
moon and the stars. She saw the planetary systems, water, light,
air, sky, and creation by transformation of ahankara. She also saw
the senses, the mind, sense perception, and the three qualities
goodness, passion and ignorance. She saw the time allotted for the
living entities, she saw natural instinct and the reactions of karma,
and she saw desires and different varieties of bodies, moving and
nonmoving. Seeing all these aspects of the cosmic manifestation,
along with herself and Vrndavana-dhama, she became doubtful
and fearful of her son’s nature.

PURPORT

All the cosmic manifestations that exist on the gross and subtle ele-
ments, as well as the means of their agitation, the three gunas, the living
entity, creation, maintenance, annihilation and everything going on in
the external energy of the Lord —all this comes from the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead, Govinda. Everything is within the control of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-
gita (9.10). Mayadhyaksena prakrtih siyate sa-caracaram: everything
in the material nature (prakrti) works under His control. Because all
these manifestations come from Govinda, they could all be visible within
the mouth of Govinda. Quite astonishingly, mother Yasoda was afraid be-
cause of intense maternal affection. She could not believe that within the
mouth of her son such things could appear. Yet she saw them, and
therefore she was struck with fear and wonder.

[Mother Yasoda began to argue within herself:] Is this a dream,

PURPORT
When mother Yaéoda saw this wonderful manifestation within the
mouth of her child, she began to argue within herself about whether it
was a dream. Then she considered, “I am not dreaming, because my eyes
are open. I am actually seeing what is happening. I am not sleeping, nor
am I dreaming. Then maybe this is an illusion created by devamaya. But
that is also not possible. What business would the demigods have show-
ing such things to me? I am an insignificant woman with no connection
with the demigods. Why should they take the trouble to put me into
devamaya? That also is not possible.” Then mother Yasoda considered
whether the vision might be due to bewilderment: “I am fit in health; I


--- Page 130 ---
Text 41] Lord Krsna Shows the Universal Form 125
am not diseased. Why should there be any bewilderment? It is not possi-
ble that my brain is deranged, since I am ordinarily quite fit to think.
Then this vision must be due to some mystic power of my son, as pre-
dicted by Gargamuni.”” Thus she finally concluded that the vision was
due to her son’s activities, and nothing else.

Therefore let me surrender unto the Supreme Personality of
Godhead and offer my obeisances unto Him, who is beyond the
conception of human speculation, the mind, activities, words and
arguments, who is the original cause of this cosmic manifestation,
by whom the entire cosmos is maintained, and by whom we can
conceive of its existence. Let me simply offer my obeisances, for


--- Page 131 ---
126 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 10, Ch. 8
He is beyond my contemplation, speculation and meditation. He is
beyond all of my material activities.
PURPORT

One simply has to realize the greatness of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. One should not try to understand Him by any material means,
subtle or gross. Mother Yasoda, being a simple woman, could not find out
the real cause of the vision; therefore, out of maternal affection, she
simply offered obeisances unto the Supreme Lord to protect her child.
She could do nothing but offer obeisances to the Lord. It is said, acintyah
khalu ye bhava na tars tarkena yojayet (Mahabharata, Bhisma
Parva 5.22). One should not try to understand the supreme cause by
argument or reasoning. When we are beset by some problem for which
we can find no reason, there is no alternative than to surrender to the
Supreme Lord and offer Him our respectful obeisances. Then our posi-
tion will be secure. This was the means adopted in this instance also by
mother Yasoda. Whatever happens, the original cause is the Supreme
Personality of Godhead (sarva-kdrana-karanam). When the immediate
cause cannot be ascertained, let us simply offer our obeisances at the
lotus feet of the Lord. Mother 36003 concluded that the wonderful
things she saw within the mouth of her child were due to Him, although
she could not clearly ascertain the cause. Therefore when a devotee can-
not ascertain the cause of suffering, he concludes:

tat te ‘nukampam susamiksamano
bhunjana evatma-krtari vipakam
hrd-vag-vapurbhir vidadhan namas te
Jiveta yo mukti-pade sa daya-bhak
(Bhag. 10.14.8)

The devotee accepts that it is due to his own past misdeeds that the
Supreme Personality of Godhead has caused him some small amount of
suffering. Thus he offers obeisances to the Lord again and again. Such a
devotee is called mukti-pade sa daya-bhak; that is, he is guaranteed his
liberation from this material world. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (2.14):

It is by the influence of the Supreme Lord’s maya that I am
wrongly thinking that Nanda Maharaja is my husband, that Krsna


--- Page 133 ---
128 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 10, Ch. 8
is my son, and that because I am the queen of Nanda Maharaja, all
the wealth of cows and calves are my possessions and all the
cowherd men and their wives are my subjects. Actually, I also am
eternally subordinate to the Supreme Lord. He is my ultimate
shelter.

PURPORT

Following in the footsteps of mother Yasoda, everyone should follow
this mentality of renunciation. Whatever wealth, opulence or whatever
else we may possess belongs not to us but to the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, who is the ultimate shelter of everyone and the ultimate owner
of everything. As stated by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gita (5.29):

bhoktaram yajiia-tapasam
sarva-loka-mahesvaram
suhrdam sarva-bhiitanam
JjAatva mam $antim rcchati
“The sages, knowing Me as the ultimate purpose of all sacrifices and
austerities, the Supreme Lord of all planets and demigods and the
benefactor and well-wisher of all living entities, attain peace from the
pangs of material miseries.”

We should not be proud of our possessions. As expressed by mother
Yasoda herein, “I am not the owner of possessions, the opulent wife of
Nanda Maharaja. The estate, the possessions, the cows and calves and the
subjects like the gopis and cowherd men are all given to me.” One should
give up thinking of “my possessions, my son and my husband” (janasya
moho ‘yam वका mameti). Nothing belongs to anyone but the Supreme
Lord. Only because of illusion do we wrongly think, “I am existing” or
“Everything belongs to me.” Thus mother Yasoda completely surren-
dered unto the Supreme Lord. For the moment, she was rather disap-
pointed, thinking, “My endeavors to protect my son by charity and other
auspicious activities are useless. The Supreme Lord has given me many
things, but unless He takes charge of everything, there is no assurance of
protection. I must therefore ultimately seek shelter of the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead.” As stated by Prahlada Maharaja (Bhag. 7.9.19),

mine.”

Mother Yasoda, by the grace of the Lord, could understand the

Although mother Yasoda understood the whole philosophy of life, at
the next moment she was overwhelmed by affection for her son by the
influence of yogamaya. Unless she took care of her son Krsna, she
thought, how could He be protected? She could not think otherwise, and
thus she forgot all her philosophical speculations. This forgetfulness is
described by Srila Vi$vanatha Cakravarti Thakura as being inspired by

the influence of yogamaya (mohana-sadharmyan mayam). Materialistic

ment of the spiritual energy, are captivated by yogamaya.

TRANSLATION
Immediately forgetting yogamaya’s illusion that Krsna had
shown the universal form within His mouth, mother Yasoda took
her son on her lap as before, feeling increased affection in her
heart for her transcendental child.
PURPORT
Mother YaSoda regarded the vision of the universal form within
Krsna’s mouth as an arrangement of yogamaya, like a dream. As one
forgets everything after a dream, mother Yasoda immediately forgot the
entire incident. As her natural feeling of affection increased, she decided
to herself, “Now let this incident be forgotten. I do not mind. Here is my
son. Let me kiss Him.”

TRANSLATION
The glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are studied
through the three Vedas, the Upanisads, the literature of sankhya-
yoga, and other Vaignava literature, yet mother Yasoda considered

that Supreme Person her ordinary child.

PURPORT

As stated in Bhagavad-gita (15.15) by the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Krsna, the purpose of studying the Vedas is to understand Him
(vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah). Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu ex-
plained to Sanatana Gosvami that there are three purposes in the Vedas.
One is to understand our relationship with Krsna (sambandha), another
is to act according to that relationship (abhidheya), and the third is to
reach the ultimate goal (prayojana). The word prayojana means
“necessities,” and the ultimate necessity is explained by Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu. Prema pum-artho mahan: the greatest necessity for a
human being is the achievement of love for the Supreme Personality of


--- Page 137 ---
132 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 10, Ch. 8
Godhead. Here we see that mother Yasoda is on the highest stage of
necessity, for she is completely absorbed in love for Krsna.

In the beginning, the Vedic purpose is pursued in three ways (trayi) —
by karma-kanda, jiana-kanda and updasana-kanda. When one reaches
the complete, perfect stage of upasana-kanda, one comes to worship
Narayana, or Lord Visnu. When Parvati asked Lord Mahadeva, Lord
Siva, what is the best method of updsand, or worship, Lord Siva
answered, daradhandnam sarvesarm visnor aradhanar param. Visni-
pasana, or vispv-aradhana, worship of Lord Visnu, is the highest stage
of perfection, as realized by Devaki. But here mother Yasoda performs
no upasand, for she has developed transcendental ecstatic love for Krsna.
Therefore her position is better than that of Devaki. In order to show
this, Srila Vyasadeva enunciates this verse, trayya copanisadbhih etc.

When a human being enters into the study of the Vedas to obtain
vidya, knowledge, he begins to take part in human civilization. Then he
advances further to study the Upanisads and gain brahma-jiiana, imper-
sonal realization of the Absolute Truth, and then he advances still
further, to sarikhya-yoga, in order to understand the supreme controller,
who is indicated in Bhagavad-gita (parari brahma param dhama
pavitrari paramam bhavan/ purusam sasvatam). When one understands
that purusa, the supreme controller, to be Paramatma, one is engaged in
the method of yoga (dhyanavasthita-tad-gatena manasa pasyanti yar
yoginah). But mother Yasoda has surpassed all these stages. She has come
to the platform of loving Krsna as her beloved child, and therefore she is
accepted to be on the highest stage of spiritual realization. The Absolute
Truth is realized in three features (brahmeti paramatmeti bhagavan iti
sabdyate), but she is in such ecstasy that she does not care to understand
what is Brahman, what is Paramatma or what is Bhagavan. Bhagavan has
personally descended to become her beloved child. Therefore there is no
comparison to mother Yasoda’s good fortune, as declared by Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu (ramya kacid upasana vrajavadhii-vargena ya kalpita).
The Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, may be
realized in different stages. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (4.11):

ye yatha mar prapadyante
tars tathaiva bhajamy aham

“As men surrender unto Me, I reward them accordingly. Everyone
follows My path in all respects, O son of Prtha.”” One may be a karmi, a
jAani, a yogiand then a bhakta or prema-bhakta. But the ultimate stage
of realization is prema-bhakti, as actually demonstrated by mother
Yasoda.

Having heard of the great fortune of mother Yasoda, Pariksit
Maharaja inquired from Sukadeva Gosvami: O learned brahmana,
mother Ya$oda’s breast milk was sucked by the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead. What past auspicious activities did she and
Nanda Maharaja perform to achieve such perfection in ecstatic
love?

134 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 10, Ch. 8
PURPORT

As stated in Bhagavad-gita (7.16), catur-vidha bhajante mar janah
sukrtino ‘rjuna. Without sukrti, or pious activities, no one can come to the
shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord is approached
by four kinds of pious men (arto jijaasur artharthi jiant ca), but here we
see that Nanda Maharaja and Yasoda surpassed all of them. Therefore
Pariksit Maharaja naturally inquired, “What kind of pious activities did
they perform in their past lives by which they achieved such a stage of
perfection ?”’ Of course, Nanda Maharaja and Yasoda are accepted as the
father and mother of Krsna, yet mother Yasoda was more fortunate than
Nanda Maharaja, Krsna’s father, because Nanda Maharaja was some-
times separated from Krsna whereas Yasoda, Krsna’s mother, was not
separated from Krsna at any moment. From Krsna’s babyhood to His
childhood and from His childhood to His youth, mother Yasoda was al-
ways in association with Krsna. Even when Krsna was grown up, He
would go to Vrndavana and sit on the lap of mother Yasoda. Therefore
there is no comparison to the fortune of mother 86008, and Pariksit
Maharaja naturally inquired, yasoda ca maha-bhaga.

TRANSLATION
Although Krsna was so pleased with Vasudeva and Devaki that
He descended as their son, they could not enjoy Krsna’s mag-
nanimous childhood pastimes, which are so great that simply
chanting about them vanquishes the contamination of the material
world. Nanda Maharaja and Yasoda, however, enjoyed these
pastimes fully, and therefore their position is always better than .
that of Vasudeva and Devaki.
PURPORT
Krsna actually took birth from the womb of Devaki, but just after His
birth He was transferred to the home of mother Yaéoda. Devaki could not
even have Krsna suck her breast. Therefore Pariksit Maharaja was
astonished. How had mother Yasoda and Nanda Maharaja become so for-
tunate that they enjoyed the complete childhood pastimes of Krsna,
which are still glorified by saintly persons? What had they done in the
past by which they were elevated to such an exalted position?

Sukadeva Gosvami said: To follow the orders of Lord Brahma,
Drona, the best of the Vasus, along with his wife, Dhara, spoke to
Lord Brahma in this way.
PURPORT
As stated in the Brahma-sarhita (5.37):
ananda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhavitabhis
tabhir ya eva nija-rupataya kalabhih
goloka eva nivasaty akhilatma-bhiito

govindam adi-purusam tam ahari bhajami
When Krsna descends anywhere, He is accompanied by His own associ-
ates. These associates are not ordinary living beings. Krsna’s pastimes
are eternal, and when He descends, He comes with His associates.
Therefore Nanda and mother Ya$oda are the eternal father and mother of
Krsna. This means that whenever Krsna descends, Nanda and Yasoda, as
well as Vasudeva and Devaki, also descend as the Lord’s father and
mother. Their personalities are expansions of Krsna’s personal body;
they are not ordinary living beings. Maharaja Pariksit knew this, but he
was curious to know from Sukadeva Gosvami whether it is possible for
an ordinary human being to come to this stage by sadhana-siddhi. There
are two kinds of perfection — nitya-siddhi and sadhana-siddhi. A nitya-
siddha is one who is eternally Krsna’s associate, an expansion of Krsna’s
personal body, whereas a sddhana-siddha is an ordinary human being
who, by executing pious activities and following regulative principles of
devotional service, also comes to that stage. Thus the purpose of
Maharaja Pariksit’s inquiry was to determine whether an ordinary
human being can attain the position of mother 14505 and Nanda
Maharaja. Sukadeva Gosvami answered this question as follows.

TRANSLATION
Drona and Dhara said: Please permit us to be born on the planet
earth so that after our appearance, the Supreme Lord, the Per-
sonality of Godhead, the supreme controller and master of all
planets, will also appear and spread devotional service, the ulti-
mate goal of life, so that those born in this material world may very
easily be delivered from the miserable condition of materialistic
life by accepting this devotional service.
PURPORT
This statement by Drona clearly indicates that Drona and Dhara are
the eternal father and mother of Krsna. Whenever there is a necessity of
Krsna’s appearance, Drona and Dhara appear first, and then Krsna ap-
pears. Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita that His birth is not ordinary (janma
karma ca me divyam).
ajo ‘pi sann avyayatma

and although I am the Lord of all sentient beings, I still appear in every

millennium in My original transcendental form.” (Bg. 4.6). Before
Krsna’s appearance, Drona and Dhara appear in order to become His
father and mother. It is they who appear as Nanda Maharaja and his
wife, Yasoda. In other words, it is not possible for a sadhana-siddha liv-
ing being to become the father or mother of Krsna, for Krsna’s father
and mother are already designated. But by following the principles ex-
hibited by Nanda Maharaja and Yasoda and their associates, the inhabi-
tants of Vrndavana, ordinary living beings may attain such affection as
exhibited by Nanda and Yasoda.

When Drona and Dhara were requested to beget children, they chose
to come to this world to have the Supreme Personality of Godhead as
their son, Krsna. Krsna’s appearance means paritranaya sadhiinam
vinasaya ca duskrtam—the devotees are protected, and the miscreants
are vanquished. Whenever Krsna comes, He distributes the highest goal
of life, devotional service. He appears as Caitanya Mahaprabhu for the
same purpose because unless one comes to devotional service, one cannot
be delivered from the miseries of the material world (duhkhalayam
asasvatam), where the living beings struggle for existence. The Lord
says in Bhagavad-gita (15.7):

mamaivarmso jwa-loke
jiva-bhitah sanatanah
manah sasthanindriyani
prakrti-sthani karsati
“The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental
parts. Because of conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the
six senses, which include the mind.”” The living entities are struggling to
become happy, but unless they take to the bhakti cult, their happiness is
not possible. Krsna clearly says:
asraddadhanah purusa
dharmasyasya parantapa
aprapya mam nivartante
mrtyu-samsara-vartmani
“Those who are not faithful on the path of devotional service cannot at-
tain Me, O conqueror of foes, but return to birth and death in this ma-
terial world.” (Bg. 9.3)

Text 50] Lord Krsna Shows the Universal Form 139

Foolish persons do not know how risky life is here if one does not
follow the instructions of Krsna. The Krsna consciousness movement,
therefore, has been started so that by practicing Krsna consciousness one
can avoid the risky life of this material existence. There is no question of
accepting or not accepting Krsna consciousness. It is not optional; it is
compulsory. If we do not take to Krsna consciousness, our life is very
risky. Everything is explained in Bhagavad-gita. Therefore, to learn
how to become free from the miserable condition of material existence,
Bhagavad-gita As It Is is the preliminary study. Then, if one under-
stands Bhagavad-gita, one can proceed to Srimad-Bhagavatam, and if
one advances further, one may study Caitanya-caritamrta. We are
therefore presenting these invaluable books to the whole world so that
people may study them and be happy, being delivered from miserable
conditional life.

_ to Sutapa and Prénigarbha, they did not undergo severe penances and
austerities to become the father and mother of Krsna. This is the dif-
ference between nitya-siddha and sadhana-siddha.

Thereafter, O Maharaja Pariksit, best of the Bharatas, when the
Supreme Personality of Godhead became the son of Nanda
Maharaja and Yasoda, they maintained continuous, unswerving de-
votional love in parental affection. And in their association, all the
other inhabitants of Vrndavana, the gopas and gopis, developed
the culture of krsna-bhakti.


--- Page 146 ---
Text 52] Lord Krsna Shows the Universal Form 141
PURPORT
Although when the Supreme Personality of Godhead stole the butter,
curd and milk of the neighboring gopas and gopis this teasing super-
ficially seemed troublesome, in fact it was an exchange of affection in the
ecstasy of devotional service. The more the gopas and gopis exchanged
feelings with the Lord, the more their devotional service increased.
Sometimes we may superficially see that a devotee is in difficulty because
of being engaged in devotional service, but the fact is different. When a
devotee suffers for Krsna, that suffering is transcendental enjoyment.
Unless one becomes a devotee, this cannot be understood. When Krsna
exhibited His childhood pastimes, not only did Nanda Maharaja and
Yasoda increase their devotional affection, but those in their association
also increased in devotional service. In other words, persons who follow
the activities of Vrndavana will also develop devotional service in the
highest perfection.

CHAPTER NINE
Mother Yasoda Binds Lord Krsna

While mother Yasoda was allowing Krsna to drink her breast milk, she
was forced to stop because she saw the milk pan boiling over on the oven.
The maidservants being engaged in other business, she stopped allowing
Krsna to drink from her breast and immediately attended to the over-
flowing milk pan. Krsna became very angry because of His mother’s
behavior and devised a means of breaking the pots of yogurt. Because He
created this disturbance, mother १३६०५१३ decided to bind Him. These
incidents are described in this chapter.

One day, the maidservants being engaged in other work, mother
Yasoda was churning the yogurt into butter herself, and in the meantime
Krsna came and requested her to allow Him to suck her breast milk. Of
course, mother (36008 immediately allowed Him to do so, but then she
saw that the hot milk on the oven was boiling over, and therefore she im-
mediately stopped allowing Krsna to drink the milk of her breast and
went to stop the milk on the oven from overflowing. Krsna, however,
having been interrupted in His business of sucking the breast, was very
angry. He took a piece of stone, broke the churning pot and entered a
room, where He began to eat the freshly churned butter. When mother
Yasoda, after attending to the overflowing milk, returned and saw the pot
broken, she could understand that this was the work of Krsna, and
therefore she went to search for Him. When she entered the room, she
saw Krsna standing on the ulikhala, a large mortar for grinding spices.
Having turned the mortar upside down, He was stealing butter hanging
from a swing and was distributing the butter to the monkeys. As soon as
Krsna saw that His mother had come, He immediately began to run away,
and mother Yasoda began to follow Him. After going some distance,
mother १३४६०१३ was able to catch Krsna, who because of His offense was
crying. Mother Yasoda, of course, threatened to punish Krsna if He acted
that way again, and she decided to bind Him with rope. Unfortunately,
when the time came to knot the rope, the rope with which she wanted to
bind Him was short by a distance equal to the width of two fingers. When

143


--- Page 149 ---
144 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 10, Ch. 9
she made the rope longer by adding another rope, she again saw that it
was short by two fingers. Again and again she tried, and again and again
she found the rope too short by two fingers. Thus she became very tired,
and Krsna, seeing His affectionate mother so tired, allowed Himself to be
bound. Now, being compassionate, He did not show her His unlimited
potency. After mother Yadoda bound Krsna and became engaged in other
household affairs, Krsna observed two yamala-arjuna trees, which were
actually Nalakivara and Manigriva, two sons of Kuvera who had been
condemned by Narada Muni to become trees. Krsna, by His mercy, now
began to proceed toward the trees to fulfill the desire of Narada Muni.

TRANSLATION

Sri Sukadeva Gosvami continued: One day when mother Yasoda
saw that all the maidservants were engaged in other household
affairs, she personally began to churn the yogurt. While churning,
she remembered the childish activities of Krsna, and in her own
way she composed songs and enjoyed singing to herself about all
those activities.

PURPORT

Srila Viévanatha Cakravarti Thakura, quoting from the Vaisnava-
tosani of Srila Sanatana Gosvamli, says that the incident of Krsna’s break-
ing the pot of yogurt and being bound by mother Yasoda took place on
the Dipavali Day, or Dipa-malika. Even today in India, this festival is
generally celebrated very gorgeously in the month of Kartika by fire-
works and lights, especially in Bombay. It is to be understood that among
all the cows of Nanda Maharaja, several of mother Yasoda’s cows ate only
grasses so flavorful that the grasses would automatically flavor the milk.
Mother १०5०५१३ wanted to collect the milk from these cows, make it into
yogurt and churn it into butter personally, since she thought that this
child Krsna was going to the houses of neighborhood gopas and gopis to
steal butter because He did not like the milk and yogurt ordinarily
prepared.

While churning the butter, mother Yasoda was singing about the
childhood activities of Krsna. It was formerly a custom that if one wanted
to remember something constantly, he would transform it into poetry or
have this done by a professional poet. It appears that mother Yasoda did
not want to forget Krsna’s activities at any time. Therefore she poeticized
all of Krsna’s childhood activities, such as the killing of Putana,
Aghasura, Sakatasura and Trnavarta, and while churning the butter, she
sang about these activities in poetical form. This should be the practice of
persons eager to remain Krsna conscious twenty-four hours a day. This


--- Page 151 ---
146 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 10, Ch. 9
incident shows how Krsna conscious mother Yasoda was. To stay in Krsna
consciousness, we should follow such persons.

eyebrows, was wet with perspiration, and malati flowers were

PURPORT

Anyone who desires to be Krsna conscious in motherly affection or
parental affection should contemplate the bodily features of mother
Yasoda. It is not that one should desire to become like Yasoda, for this is
Mayavada. Either in parental affection or conjugal love, friendship or
servitorship—in any way —we must follow in the footsteps of the inhabi-
tants of Vrndavana, not try to become like them. Therefore this descrip-
tion is provided here. Advanced devotees must cherish this description,
always thinking of mother Yasoda’s features—how she was dressed, how
she was working and perspiring, how beautifully the flowers were ar-
ranged in her hair, and so on. One should take advantage of the full de-
scription provided here by thinking of mother YaSoda in maternal
affection for Krsna.

on her lap, and began to look upon the face of the Lord with great
love and affection. Because of her intense affection, milk was flow-
ing from her breast. But when she saw that the milk pan on the

oven was boiling over, she immediately left her son to take care of
the overflowing milk, although the child was not yet fully satisfied
with drinking the milk of His mother’s breast.
PURPORT
Everything in the household affairs of mother १३६०१ was meant for
Krsna. Although Krsna was drinking the breast milk of mother Yasoda,
when she saw that the milk pan in the kitchen was overflowing, she had
to take care of it immediately, and thus she left her son, who then be-
came very angry, not having been fully satisfied with drinking the milk
of her breast. Sometimes one must take care of more than one item of
important business for the same purpose. Therefore mother Yasoda was
not unjust when she left her son to take care of the overflowing milk. On
the platform of love and affection, it is the duty of the devotee to do one
thing first and other things later. The proper intuition by which to do
this is given by Krsna.

(Bg. 10.10)
In Krsna consciousness, everything is dynamic. Krsna guides the devotee
in what to do first and what to do next on the platform of absolute truth.

TRANSLATION
Being very angry and biting His reddish lips with His teeth,
Krsna, with false tears in His eyes, broke the container of yogurt
with a piece of stone. Then He entered a room and began to eat the
freshly churned butter in a solitary place.
PURPORT
It is natural that when a child becomes angry he can begin crying with
false tears in his eyes. So Krsna did this, and biting His reddish lips with
His teeth, He broke the pot with a stone, entered a room and began to eat
the freshly churned butter.

Mother Yasoda, after taking down the hot milk from the oven,
returned to the churning spot, and when she saw that the con-
tainer of yogurt was broken and that Krsna was not present, she
concluded that the breaking of the pot was the work of Krsna.
PURPORT
Seeing the pot broken and Krsna not present, 86008 definitely con-
cluded that the breaking of the pot was the work of Krsna. There was no
doubt about it.

TRANSLATION
Krsna, at that time, was sitting on an upside-down wooden mor-
tar for grinding spices and was distributing milk preparations
such as yogurt and butter to the monkeys as He liked. Because of
having stolen, He was looking all around with great anxiety,
suspecting that He might be chastised by His mother. Mother
Yasoda, upon seeing Him, very cautiously approached Him from
behind.
PURPORT
Mother Yasoda was able to trace Krsna by following His butter-
smeared footprints. She saw that Krsna was stealing butter, and thus she
smiled. Meanwhile, the crows also entered the room and came out in fear.
Thus mother Yasoda found Krsna stealing butter and very anxiously
looking here and there.

Text 10] Mother Yasoda Binds Lord Krsna 153
TRANSLATION
When Lord Sri Krsna saw His mother, stick in hand, He very
quickly got down from the top of the mortar and began to flee as if
very much afraid. Although yogis try to capture Him as Paramatma
by meditation, desiring to enter into the effulgence of the Lord
with great austerities and penances, they fail to reach Him. But
mother ०६०१३, thinking that same Personality of Godhead, Krsna,
to be her son, began following Krsna to catch Him.
PURPORT
Yogis, mystics, want to catch Krsna as Paramatma, and with great
austerities and penances they try to approach Him, yet they cannot. Here
we see, however, that Krsna is going to be caught by (36003 and is run-
ning away in fear. This illustrates the difference between the bhakta and
the yogi. Yogis cannot reach Krsna, but for pure devotees like mother
३६०१३, Krsna is already caught. Krsna was even afraid of mother
Yasoda’s stick. This was mentioned by Queen Kunti in her prayers:
bhaya-bhavanaya sthitasya (Bhag. 1.8.31). Krsna is afraid of mother
३६०१३, and yogis are afraid of Krsna. Yogis try to reach Krsna by jAaana-
yoga and other yogas, but fail. Yet although mother Yasoda was a woman,
Krsna was afraid of her, as clearly described in this verse.

TRANSLATION
‘While following Krsna, mother Yasoda, her thin waist overbur-
dened by her heavy breasts, naturally had to reduce her speed. Be-
cause of following Krsna very swiftly, her hair became loose, and
the flowers in her hair were falling after her. Yet she did not fail to
capture her son Krsna.
PURPORT
Yogis cannot capture Krsna by severe penances and austerities, but
mother Yasoda, despite all obstacles, was finally able to catch Krsna with-
out difficulty. This is the difference between a yogi and a bhakta. Yogis
cannot enter even the effulgence of Krsna. Yasya prabha prabhavato
jagad-anda-koti-kotisu (Brahma-sarihita 5.40). In that effulgence there
are millions of universes, but yogis and janis cannot enter that
effulgence even after many, many years of austerities, whereas bhaktas
can capture Krsna simply by love and affection. This is the example
shown here by mother Yasoda. Krsna therefore confirms that if one
wants to capture Him, one must undertake devotional service.
bhaktya mam abhijanati
yavan yas casmi tattvatah
tato mam tattvato jidatva

(Bg. 18.55)
Bhaktas enter even the planet of Krsna very easily, but the less intelli-
gent yogis and (दाऽ, by their meditation, remain running after Krsna.
Even if they enter Krsna’s effulgence, they fall down.

TRANSLATION
‘When caught by mother Yasoda, Krsna became more and more
afraid and admitted to being an offender. As she looked upon Him,
she saw that He was crying, His tears mixing with the black oint-
ment around His eyes, and as He rubbed His eyes with His hands,
He smeared the ointment all over His face. Mother Ya$oda, catch-
ing her beautiful son by the hand, mildly began to chastise Him.
PURPORT

From these dealings between mother Yasoda and Krsna, we can under-
stand the exalted position of a pure devotee in loving service to the Lord.
Yogis, janis, karmis and Vedantists cannot even approach Krsna; they
must remain very, very far away from Him and try to enter His bodily

156 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 10, Ch. 9
effulgence, although this also they are unable to do. Great demigods like
Lord Brahma and Lord Siva always worship the Lord by meditation and
by service. Even the most powerful Yamaraja fears Krsna. Therefore, as
we find in the history of Ajamila, Yamaraja instructed his followers not
even to approach the devotees, what to speak of capturing them. In other
words, Yamaraja also fears Krsna and Krsna’s devotees. Yet this Krsna
became so dependent on mother 36003 that when she simply showed
Krsna the stick in her hand, Krsna admitted to being an offender and
began to cry like an ordinary child. Mother Yasoda, of course, did not
want to chastise her beloved child very much, and therefore she im-
mediately threw her stick away and simply rebuked Krsna, saying, ‘Now
I shall bind You so that You cannot commit any further offensive ac-
tivities. Nor for the time being can You play with Your playmates.” This
shows the position of a pure devotee, in contrast with others, like janis,
yogis and the followers of Vedic ritualistic ceremonies, in regarding the
transcendental nature of the Absolute Truth.

cause of maternal affection for Krsna, she never even cared to
know who He was. Therefore, when she saw that her son had be-
come excessively afraid, she threw the stick away and desired to
bind Him so that He would not commit any further naughty
activities.
PURPORT
Mother Yasoda wanted to bind Krsna not in order to chastise Him but
because she thought that the child was so restless that He might leave the
house in fear. That would be another disturbance. Therefore, because of
full affection, to stop Krsna from leaving the house, she wanted to bind
Him with rope. Mother (38008 wanted to impress upon Krsna that since
He was afraid merely to see her stick, He should not perform such dis-
turbing activities as breaking the container of yogurt and butter and dis-
tributing its contents to the monkeys. Mother Yasoda did not care to
understand who Krsna was and how His power spreads everywhere. This
is an example of pure love for Krsna.

TRANSLATION

The Supreme Personality of Godhead has no beginning and no
end, no exterior and no interior, no front and no rear. In other
words, He is all-pervading. Because He is not under the influence
of the element of time, for Him there is no difference between
past, present and future; He exists in His own transcendental form
at all times. Being absolute, beyond relativity, He is free from dis-
tinctions between cause and effect, although He is the cause and
effect of everything. That unmanifested person, who is beyond the
perception of the senses, had now appeared as a human child, and
mother Yasoda, considering Him her own ordinary child, bound
Him to the wooden mortar with a rope.

PURPORT

In Bhagavad-gita (10.12), Krsna is described as the Supreme Brah-
man (param brahma param dhama). The word brahma means “the
greatest.” Krsna is greater than the greatest, being unlimited and all-
pervading. How can it be possible for the all-pervading to be measured
or bound? Then again, Krsna is the time factor. Therefore, He is all-
pervading not only in space but also in time. We have measurements of
time, but although we are limited by past, present and future, for Krsna
these do not exist. Every individual person can be measured, but Krsna
has already shown that although He also is an individual, the entire cos-
mic manifestation is within His mouth. All these points considered,
Krsna cannot be measured. How then did Yasoda want to measure Him
and bind Him? We must conclude that this took place simply on the plat-
form of pure transcendental love. This was the only cause.

Everything is one because Krsna is the supreme cause of everything.
Krsna cannot be measured or calculated by Vedic knowledge (vedesu

ing service (bhaktya mam abhijanati yavan yas casmi tattvatah). Thus
mother Yasoda wanted to bind Him.

‘When mother YaSoda was trying to bind the offending child, she

fingers. Thus she brought another rope to join to it.
PURPORT
Here is the first chapter in Krsna’s exhibition of unlimited potency to
mother Yaéoda when she tried to bind Him: the rope was too short. The


--- Page 165 ---
160 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 10, Ch. 9
Lord had already shown His unlimited potency by killing Putans,
Sakatasura and Trpavarta. Now Krsna exhibited another vibhiti, or dis-
play of potency, to mother १३६०१. “Unless I agree,” Krsna desired to
show, “you cannot bind Me.”” Thus although mother Yasoda, in her at-
tempt to bind Krsna, added one rope after another, ultimately she was a
failure. When Krsna agreed, however, she was successful. In other
words, one must be in transcendental love with Krsna, but that does not
mean that one can control Krsna. When Krsna is satisfied with one’s de-
votional service, He does everything Himself. Sevonmukhe hi jihvadau
svayam eva sphuraty adah. He reveals more and more to the devotee as
the devotee advances in service. Jihvadau: this service begins with the
tongue, with chanting and with taking the prasada of Krsna.

shortness could not be overcome.

TRANSLATION

Thus mother Yasoda joined whatever ropes were available in the
household, but still she failed in her attempt to bind Krsna.
Mother Yasoda’s friends, the elderly gopis in the neighborhood,
were smiling and enjoying the fun. Similarly, mother Yasoda, al-
though laboring in that way, was also smiling. All of them were
struck with wonder.

PURPORT

Actually this incident was wonderful because Krsna was only a child
with small hands. To bind Him should have required only a rope not
more than two feet long. All the ropes in the house combined together
might have been hundreds of feet long, but still He was impossible to


--- Page 167 ---
162 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 10, Ch. 9
bind, for all the ropes together were still too short. Naturally mother
Yasoda and her gopi friends thought, “How is this possible?”” Seeing this
funny affair, all of them were smiling. The first rope was short by a
measurement the width of two fingers, and after the second rope was ad-
ded, it was still two fingers too short. If the shortness of all the ropes
were added together, it must have amounted to the width of hundreds of
fingers. Certainly this was astonishing. This was another exhibition of
Krsna’s inconceivable potency to His mother and His mother’s friends.

Because of mother Yasoda’s hard labor, her whole body became
covered with perspiration, and the flowers and comb were falling
from her hair. When child Krsna saw His mother thus fatigued, He
became merciful to her and agreed to be bound.
PURPORT
When mother 36008 and the other ladies finally saw that Krsna, al-
though decorated with many bangles and other jeweled ornaments, could

not be bound with all the ropes available in the house, they decided that
Krsna was so fortunate that He could not be bound by any material con-
dition. Thus they gave up the idea of binding Him. But in competition
between Krsna and His devotee, Krsna sometimes agrees to be defeated.
Thus Krsna’s internal energy, yogamdya, was brought to work, and
Krsna agreed to be bound by mother Yasoda.

By His one plenary portion as Paramatma, the Lord controls innumerable
universes, with all their demigods; yet He agrees to be controlled by a
devotee. In the Upanisads it is said that the Supreme Personality of God-
head can run with more speed than the mind, but here we see that al-
though Krsna wanted to avoid being arrested by His mother, He was
finally defeated, and mother Yasoda captured Him. Laksmi-sahasra-sata-
sambhrama-sevyamanam: Krsna is served by hundreds and thousands
of goddesses of fortune. Nonetheless, He steals butter like one who is
poverty-stricken. Yamaraja, the controller of all living entities, fears the
order of Krsna, yet Krsna is afraid of His mother’s stick. These con-
tradictions cannot be understood by one who is not a devotee, but a devo-
tee can understand how powerful is unalloyed devotional service to
Krsna; it is so powerful that Krsna can be controlled by an unalloyed
devotee. This bhrtya-vasyata does not mean that He is under the control
of the servant; rather, He is under the control of the servant’s pure love.
In Bhagavad-gita (1.21) it is said that Krsna became the chariot driver
of Arjuna. Arjuna ordered Him, senayor ubhayor madhye 70077
sthapaya me ’cyuta: “My dear Krsna, You have agreed to be my
charioteer and to execute my orders. Place my chariot between the two
armies of soldiers.” Krsna immediately executed this order, and
therefore one may argue that Krsna also is not independent. But this is
one’s ajiiana, ignorance. Krsna is always fully independent; when He
becomes subordinate to His devotees, this is a display of ananda-
cinmaya-rasa, the humor of transcendental qualities that increases His
transcendental pleasure. Everyone worships Krsna as the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead, and therefore He sometimes desires to be controlled
by someone else. Such a controller can be no one else but a pure devotee.

TRANSLATION

Neither Lord Brahma, nor Lord Siva, nor even the goddess of
fortune, who is always the better half of the Supreme Lord, can
obtain from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the deliverer
from this material world, such mercy as received by mother
१७5०१.

PURPORT

This is a comparative study between mother Yasoda and other devotees
of the Lord. As stated in Caitanya-caritamrta (Adi 5.142), ekale 0৫70
krsna, ara saba bhrtya: the only supreme master is Krsna, and all others
are His servants. Krsna has the transcendental quality of bhrtya-vasyata,
becoming subordinate to His bhrtya, or servant. Now, although everyone
is bhrtya and although Krsna has the quality of becoming subordinate to
His bhrtya, the position of mother Yasoda is the greatest. Lord Brahma is
bhrtya, a servant of Krsna, and he is adi-kavi, the original creator of this
universe (tene brahma hrda ya adi-kavaye). Nonetheless, even he could
not obtain such mercy as mother ३5० ब. As for Lord Siva, he is the top-
most Vaisnava (vaisnavanam yatha sambhuh). What to speak of Lord


--- Page 171 ---
166 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 10, Ch. 9
Brahma and Lord Siva, the goddess of fortune, Laksmi, is the Lord’s con-
stant companion in service, since she always associates with His body.
But even she could not get such mercy. Therefore Maharaja Pariksit was
surprised, thinking, “What did mother Yasoda and Nanda Maharaja do
in their previous lives by which they got such a great opportunity, the
opportunity to be the affectionate father and mother of Krsna?”

In this verse there are three negative pronouncements— na, na, na.
When anything is uttered three times—“‘do it, do it, do 1४? —one should
understand that this is meant to indicate great stress on a fact. In this
verse, we find na lebhire, na lebhire, na lebhire. Yet mother १३६०३ is in
the supermost exalted position, and thus Krsna has become completely
subordinate to her. ॥

The word vimuktidat is also significant. There are different types of
liberation, such as sayujya, salokya, saripya, sarsti and samipya, but
vimukti means “special mukti.”” When after liberation one is situated on
the platform of prema-bhakti, one is said to have achieved vimukti,
“‘special mukti.” Therefore the word na is mentioned. That exalted plat-
form of prema is described by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu as prema
pum-artho mahan, and mother Yasoda naturally acts in such an exalted
position in loving affairs. She is therefore a nitya-siddha devotee, an ex-
pansion of Krsna’s hladint potency, His potency to enjoy transcendental
bliss through expansions who are special devotees (ananda-cinmaya-
rasa-pratibhavitabhih). Such devotees are not sadhana-siddha.

TRANSLATION

The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, the son of mother
४७6०५१६, is accessible to devotees engaged in spontaneous loving
service, but He is not as easily accessible to mental speculators, to
those striving for self-realization by severe austerities and pen-
ances, or to those who consider the body the same as the self.

PURPORT

Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the son of mother
Yasoda, is very easily available to devotees, but not to tapasvis, yogis,
jiianis and others who have a bodily concept of life. Although they may
sometimes be called santa-bhaktas, real bhakti begins with dasya-rasa.
Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (4.11):

ye yatha mam prapadyante
tars tathaiva bhajamy aham
mama vartmanuvartante
manusyah partha sarvasah

“As living entities surrender unto Me, I reward them accordingly.
Everyone follows My path in all respects, O son of Prtha.”” Everyone is
seeking Krsna, for He is the Supersoul of all individual souls. Everyone
loves his body and wants to protect it because he is within the body as the
soul, and everyone loves the soul because the soul is part and parcel of
the Supersoul. Therefore, everyone is actually seeking to achieve happi-
ness by reviving his relationship with the Supersoul. As the Lord says in
Bhagavad-gita (15.15), vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah: “By all the
Vedas, it is I who am to be known.” Therefore, the karmis, janis, yogis
and saintly persons are all seeking Krsna. But by following in the


--- Page 173 ---
168 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 10, Ch. 9
footsteps of devotees who are in a direct relationship with Krsna, es-
pecially the inhabitants of Vrndavana, one can reach the supreme posi-
tion of associating with Krsna. As it is said, vrndavanarm parityajya
padam ekam na gacchati: Krsna does not leave Vrndavana even for a
moment. The vrndavana-vasis—mother १३६०५१३, Krsna’s friends and
Krsna’s conjugal lovers, the younger gopis with whom He dances—have
very intimate relationships with Krsna, and if one follows in the
footsteps of these devotees, Krsna is available. Although the nitya-siddha
expansions of Krsna always remain with Krsna, if those engaged in
sadhana-siddhi follow in the footsteps of Krsna’s nitya-siddha associ-
ates, such sadhana-siddhas also can easily attain Krsna without dif-
ficulty. But there are those who are attached to bodily concepts of life.
Lord Brahma and Lord Siva, for example, have very prestigious posi-
tions, and thus they have the sense of being very exalted iSvaras. In other
words, because Lord Brahma and Lord Siva are guna-avataras and have
exalted positions, they have some small sense of being like Krsna. But
the pure devotees who inhabit Vrndavana do not possess any bodily con-
ception. They are fully dedicated to the service of the Lord in sublime
affection, prema. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has therefore recommended,
prema pum-artho mahan: the highest perfection of life is prema, pure
love in relationship with Krsna. And mother ३६०३ appears to be the
topmost of devotees who have attained this perfection.

In their former birth, these two sons, known as Nalakiivara and

pride and false prestige, they did not care about anyone, and thus
Narada Muni cursed them to become trees.

Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “Mother Yasoda Binds Lord
Krsna.”


--- Page 175 ---
CHAPTER TEN
Deliverance of the Yamala-arjuna Trees

This chapter describes how Krsna broke the twin arjuna trees, from
which Nalakivara and Manigriva, the sons of Kuvera, then came out.

Nalakivara and Manigriva were great devotees of Lord Siva, but be-
cause of material opulence they became so extravagant and senseless that
one day they were enjoying with naked girls in a lake and shamelessly
walking here and there. Suddenly Narada Muni passed by, but they were
so maddened by their wealth and false prestige that even though they
saw Narada Muni present, they remained naked and were not even
ashamed. In other words, because of opulence and false prestige, they
lost their sense of common decency. Of course, it is the nature of the ma-
terial qualities that when one becomes very much opulent in terms of
wealth and a prestigious position, one loses one’s sense of etiquette and
does not care about anyone, even a sage like Narada Muni. For such
bewildered persons (ahankara-vimidhatma), who especially deride
devotees, the proper punishment is to be again stricken with poverty.
The Vedic rules and regulations prescribe how to control the false sense
of prestige by the practice of yama, niyama and so on (tapasa
brahmacaryena 5८71९710. ca damena ca). A poor man can be convinced
very easily that the prestige of an opulent position in this material world
is temporary, but a rich man cannot. Therefore Narada Muni set an ex-
ample by cursing these two persons, Nalakivara and Manigriva, to be-
come dull and unconscious like trees. This was a fit punishment. But
because Krsna is always merciful, even though they were punished they
were fortunate enough to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to
face. Therefore the punishment given by Vaisnavas is not at all punish-
ment; rather, it is another kind of mercy. By the curse of the devarsi,
Nalakivara and Manigriva became twin arjuna trees and remained in
the courtyard of mother Yasoda and Nanda Maharaja, waiting for the op-
portunity to see Krsna directly. Lord Krsna, by the desire of His devotee,
uprooted these yamala-arjuna trees, and when Nalaktvara and
Manigriva were thus delivered by Krsna after one hundred years of the

171


--- Page 176 ---
172 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 10, Ch. 10
devas, their old consciousness revived, and they offered Krsna prayers
suitable to be offered by demigods. Having thus gotten the opportunity to
see Krsna face to face, they understood how merciful Narada Muni was,
and therefore they expressed their indebtedness to him and thanked
him. Then, after circumambulating the Supreme Personality of God-
head, Krsna, they departed for their respective abodes.

they would wander in that garden of flowers, their eyes always
rolling in intoxication.

174 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 10, Ch. 10
PURPORT

This verse mentions some of the material advantages afforded to per-
sons associated with or devoted to Lord Siva. Apart from Lord Siva, if
one is a devotee of any other demigod, one receives some material advan-
tages. Foolish people, therefore, become devotees of demigods. This has
been pointed out and criticized by Lord Krsna in Bhagavad-gita (7.20):
kamais tais tair hrta-jianah prapadyante ’nya-devatah. Those who are
not devotees of Krsna have a taste for women, wine and so forth, and
therefore they have been described as hrta-jiana, bereft of sense. The
Krsna consciousness movement can very easily point out such foolish
persons, for they have been indicated in Bhagavad-gita (7.15), where
Lord Krsna says:

na mar duskrtino madhah
prapadyante naradhamah
mayayapahrta-jiana
asuram bhavam asritah
“Those miscreants who are grossly foolish, lowest among mankind,
whose knowledge is stolen by illusion, and who partake of the atheistic
nature of demons, do not surrender unto Me.” Anyone who is not a devo-
tee of Krsna and does not surrender to Krsna must be considered
naradhama, the lowest of men, and duskrti, one who always commits
sinful activities. Thus there is no difficulty in finding out who is a third-
class or fourth-class man, for one’s position can be understood simply by
this crucial test: is he or is he not a devotee of Krsna?

Why are devotees of the demigods greater in number than the
Vaisnavas? The answer is given herein. Vaisnavas are not interested in
such fourth-class pleasures as wine and women, nor does Krsna allow
them such facilities.

one’s mental condition.

Wherever Narada Muni goes, any moment at which he appears is under-

“According to their karma, all living entities are wandering throughout
the entire universe. Some of them are being elevated to the upper plan-
etary systems, and some are going down into the lower planetary
systems. Out of many millions of wandering living entities, one who is
very fortunate gets an opportunity to associate with a bona fide spiritual
master by the grace of Krsna. By the mercy of both Krsna and the spiri-
tual master, such a person receives the seed of the creeper of devotional
service.” (Cc. Madhya 19.151) Narada appeared in the garden to give
the two sons of Kuvera the seed of devotional service, even though they
were intoxicated. Saintly persons know how to bestow mercy upon the
fallen souls.

special mercy, desired to give them a special curse. Thus he spoke
as follows.

PURPORT

Although in the beginning Narada Muni appeared very angry and
cursed them, at the end the two demigods Nalakivara and Manigriva
were able to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, face to face.
Thus the curse was ultimately auspicious and brilliant. One has to judge
what kind of curse Narada placed upon them. Srila Viévanatha
Cakravarti Thakura gives herein a good example. When a father finds
his child deeply asleep but the child has to take some medicine to cure
some disease, the father pinches the child so that the child will get up
and take the medicine. In a similar way, Narada Muni cursed Nalakavara
and Manigriva in order to cure their disease of material blindness.

--- Page 183 ---
Text 9] Deliverance of the Yamala-arjuna Trees 179
TRANSLATION

Narada Muni said: Among all the attractions of material enjoy-
ment, the attraction of riches bewilders one’s intelligence more
than having beautiful bodily features, taking birth in an
aristocratic family, and being learned. When one is uneducated
but falsely puffed up by wealth, the result is that one engages his
wealth in enjoying wine, women and gambling.

PURPORT

Among the three modes of material nature—goodness, passion and ig-
norance — people are certainly conducted by the lower qualities, namely
passion and ignorance, and especially by passion. Conducted by the mode
of passion, one becomes more and more involved in material existence.
Therefore human life is meant for subduing the modes of passion and
ignorance and advancing in the mode of goodness.

tada rajas-tamo-bhavah
kama-lobhadayas ca ye
ceta etair anaviddham
sthitar sattve prasidati
(Bhag. 1.2.19)
This is culture: one must subdue the modes of passion and ignorance. In
the mode of passion, when one is falsely proud of wealth, one engages his
wealth only for three things, namely wine, women and gambling. We can
actually see, especially in this age, that those who have unnecessary
riches simply try to enjoy these three things. In Western civilization,
these three things are very prominent because of an unnecessary in-
crease of wealth. Narada Muni considered all this in the case of
Manigriva and Nalakiivara because he found in them so much pride in
the wealth of their father, Kuvera.

TRANSLATION
Unable to control their senses, rascals who are falsely proud of
their riches or their birth in aristocratic families are so cruel that
to maintain their perishable bodies, which they think will never
grow old or die, they kill poor animals without mercy. Sometimes
they kill animals merely to enjoy an excursion.
PURPORT
When the modes of passion and ignorance increase in human society,
giving rise to unnecessary economic development, the result is that
people become involved with wine, women and gambling. Then, being
mad, they maintain big slaughterhouses or occasionally go on pleasure
excursions to kill animals. Forgetting that however one may try to main-
tain the body, the body is subject to birth, death, old age and disease,
such foolish rascals engage in sinful activities, one after another. Being
duskrtis, they completely forget the existence of the supreme controller,
who is sitting within the core of everyone’s heart (5८0०१ sarva-
bhutanam hrd-dese ‘rjuna tisthati). That supreme controller is observing
every bit of one’s activity, and He rewards or punishes everyone by
giving one a suitable body made by material nature (bhramayan sarva-
bhatani yantraridhani mayaya). In this way, sinful persons auto-
matically receive punishment in different types of bodies. The root cause
of this punishment is that when one unnecessarily accumulates wealth,


--- Page 185 ---
Text 10] Deliverance of the Yamala-arjuna Trees 181
one becomes more and more degraded, not knowing that his wealth will
be finished with his next birth.
na sadhu manye yata atmano yam
asann api klesada asa dehah
(Bhag. 5.5.4)

Animal killing is prohibited. Every living being, of course, has to eat
something (jivo jivasya jivanam). But one should be taught what kind of
food one should take. Therefore the ISopanisad instructs, tena tyaktena
bhusijithah: one should eat whatever is allotted for human beings. Krsna
says in Bhagavad-gita (9.26):

patra pusparm phalari 0) 077
yo me bhaktya prayacchati
tad ahari bhakty-upahrtam
asnami prayatatmanah
“If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit or water, I
will accept it.” A devotee, therefore, does not eat anything that would re-
quire slaughterhouses for poor animals. Rather, devotees take prasada of
Krsna (tena tyaktena bhufijithah). Krsna recommends that one give Him
patram puspari phalarm toyam—a leaf, a flower, fruit or water. Animal
food is never recommended for human beings; instead, a human being is
recommended to take prasada, remnants of food left by Krsna. Yajia-si-
stasinah santo mucyante sarva-kilbisaih (Bg. 3.13). If one practices
eating prasada, even if there is some little sinful activity involved, one
becomes free from the results of sinful acts.

deva-sariyjiiitam —the body now known as a very exalted person, like
president, minister or even demigod; api—even if the body is so exalted;
ante —after death; krmi—turns into worms; vit—or into stool; bhasma-
sarijiiitam—or into ashes; bhita-dhruk—a person who does not accept
the §astric injunctions and is unnecessarily envious of other living en-
tities; tat-krte—by acting in that way; sva-artham—self-interest; kim —
who is there; veda—who knows; nirayah yatah—because from such
sinful activities one must suffer hellish conditions.

TRANSLATION

While living one may be proud of one’s body, thinking oneself a
very big man, minister, president or even demigod, but whatever
one may be, after death this body will turn either into worms, into
stool or into ashes. If one kills poor animals to satisfy the tempo-
rary whims of this body, one does not know that he will suffer in
his next birth, for such a sinful miscreant must go to hell and
suffer the results of his actions.

PURPORT

In this verse the three words krmi-vid-bhasma are significant. After
death, the body may become krmi, which means “worms,” for if the
body is disposed of without cremation, it may be eaten by worms; or else
it may be eaten by animals like hogs and vultures and be turned into
stool. Those who are more civilized burn the dead body, and thus it be-
comes ashes (bhasma-samjiiitam). Yet although the body will be turned
into worms, stool or ashes, foolish persons, just to maintain it, commit
many sinful activities. This is certainly regrettable. The human form of
body is actually meant for jiwasya tattva-jijidsa, enlightenment in
knowledge of spiritual values. Therefore, one must seek shelter of a bona
fide spiritual master. Tasmad gurum prapadyeta: one must approach a
guru. Who is a guru? Sabde pare ca nisnatam (Bhag. 11.3.21): a guru is
one who has full transcendental knowledge. Unless one approaches a
spiritual master, one remains in ignorance. Acaryavan puruso veda


--- Page 187 ---
Text 11] Deliverance of the Yamala-arjuna Trees 183
(Chandogya Upanisad 6.14.2): one has full knowledge about life when
one is dcaryavan, controlled by the acarya. But when one is conducted
by rajo-guna and tamo-guna, one does not care about anything: instead.
one acts like an ordinary foolish animal, risking his life (mrtyu-samsara-
vartmani) and therefore continuing to go through suffering after suffer-
ing. Na te viduh svartha-gatim hi vispum (01:৫8. 7.5.31). Such a foolish
person does not know how to elevate himself in this body. Instead, he in-
dulges in sinful activities and goes deeper and deeper into hellish life.

many possible claimants, who is the rightful claimant? Not to

TRANSLATION

This body, after all, is produced by the unmanifested nature and
again annihilated and merged in the natural elements. Therefore,
it is the common property of everyone. Under the circumstances,
who but a rascal claims this property as his own and while main-
taining it commits such sinful activities as killing animals just to
satisfy his whims? Unless one is a rascal, one cannot commit such
sinful activities.

PURPORT

Atheists do not believe in the existence of the soul. Nonetheless, unless
one is very cruel, why should one kill animals unnecessarily? The body
is a manifestation of a combination of matter. In the beginning it was
nothing, but by a combination of matter it has come into existence. Then
again, when the combination is dismantled, the body will no longer exist.


--- Page 189 ---
Text 13] Deliverance of the Yamala-arjuna Trees 185
In the beginning it was nothing, and in the end it will be nothing. Why
then should one commit sinful activities when it is manifested? It is not
possible for anyone to do this unless he is rascal number one.

TRANSLATION
Atheistic fools and rascals who are very much proud of wealth
fail to see things as they are. Therefore, returning them to poverty
is the proper ointment for their eyes so they may see things as they
are. At least a poverty-stricken man can realize how painful
poverty is, and therefore he will not want others to be in a painful
condition like his own.
PURPORT
Even today, if a man who was formerly poverty-stricken gets money,
he is inclined to utilize his money to perform many philanthropic ac-
tivities, like opening schools for uneducated men and hospitals for the
diseased. In this connection there is an instructive story called punar
misiko bhava, ‘Again Become a Mouse.” A mouse was very much
harassed by a cat, and therefore the mouse approached a saintly person to
request to become a cat. When the mouse became a cat, he was harassed


--- Page 190 ---
186 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 10, Ch. 10
by a dog, and then when he became a dog, he was harassed by a tiger. But
when he became a tiger, he stared at the saintly person, and when the
saintly person asked him, “What do you want?”’ the tiger said, “I want to
eat you.” Then the saintly person cursed him, saying, “May you again
become a mouse.” A similar thing is going on all over the universe. One
is going up and down, sometimes becoming a mouse, sometimes a tiger,
and so on. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu said:
brahmanda bhramite kona bhagyavan jiva
guru-krsna-prasade paya bhakti-lata-bija
(Ce. Madhya 19.151)
The living entities are promoted and degraded by the laws of nature, but
if one is very, very fortunate, by association with saintly persons he gets
the seed of devotional service, and his life becomes successful. Narada
Muni wanted to bring Nalakiivara and Manigriva to the platform of de-
votional service through poverty, and thus he cursed them. Such is the
mercy of a Vaisnava. Unless one is brought to the Vaisnava platform, one
cannot be a good man. Harav abhaktasya kuto mahad-gunah
(Bhag. 5.18.12). An avaisnava never becomes a good man, however
severely he is punished.

TRANSLATION
By seeing their faces, one whose body has been pricked by pins
can understand the pain of others who are pinpricked. Realizing
that this pain is the same for everyone, he does not want others to
suffer in this way. But one who has never been pricked by pins
cannot understand this pain.
PURPORT
There is a saying, ‘““The happiness of wealth is enjoyable by a person
who has tasted the distress of poverty.” There is also another common
saying, vandhyda ki bujhibe prasava-vedana: “A woman who has not
given birth to a child cannot understand the pain of childbirth.” Unless
one comes to the platform of actual experience, one cannot realize what is
pain and what is happiness in this material world. The laws of nature act
accordingly. If one has killed an animal, one must himself be killed by
that same animal. This is called marisa. Mam means “me,” and sa
means “‘he.”” As I am eating an animal, that animal will have the oppor-
tunity to eat me. In every state, therefore, it is ordinarily the custom that
if a person commits murder he is hanged.

tat—that; hi—indeed; tasya—his; param —perfect; tapah—austerity.
TRANSLATION
A poverty-stricken man must automatically undergo austerities
and penances because he does not have the wealth to possess any-
thing. Thus his false prestige is vanquished. Always in need of
food, shelter and clothing, he must be satisfied with what is ob-
tained by the mercy of providence. Undergoing such compulsory
austerities is good for him because this purifies him and com-
pletely frees him from false ego.
PURPORT
A saintly person voluntarily accepts a state of poverty just to become
free from material false prestige. Many great kings left their princely
standard of living and went to the forest to practice austerity according to
Vedic culture, just to become purified. But if one who cannot voluntarily
accept such austerity is put into a situation of poverty, he automatically
must practice austerity. Austerity is good for everyone because it frees
one from material conditions. Therefore, if one is very much proud of
his material position, putting him into poverty is the best way to rectify
his foolishness. Daridrya-doso guna-rasi-nasi: when a person is poverty-
stricken, naturally his false pride in aristocracy, wealth, education and
beauty is smashed. Thus corrected, he is in the right position for
liberation.

poverty-stricken; anna-karksinah—always desiring to get sufficient
food; indriyani—the senses, which are compared to snakes;

hirisa api—the tendency to be envious of others; vinivartate—reduces.

TRANSLATION

Always hungry, longing for sufficient food, a poverty-stricken
man gradually becomes weaker and weaker. Having no extra po-
tency, his senses are automatically pacified. A poverty-stricken
man, therefore, is unable to perform harmful, envious activities.
In other words, such a man automatically gains the results of the
austerities and penances adopted voluntarily by saintly persons.

PURPORT

According to the opinion of experienced medical practitioners,
diabetes is a result of voracious eating, and tuberculosis is a disease of
undereating. We should desire neither to be diabetic nor to be tubercu-
lar. Yavad artha-prayojanam. We should eat frugally and keep the body
fit for advancing in Krsna consciousness. As recommended elsewhere in
Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.10):

kamasya nendriya-pritir
labho jweta yavata
Jjwasya tattva-jjiasa
nartho yas ceha karmabhih

The real business of human life is to keep oneself fit for advancement in
spiritual realization. Human life is not meant for making the senses un-
necessarily strong so that one suffers from disease and one increases in
an envious, fighting spirit. In this age of Kali, however, human civiliza-
tion is so misled that people are unnecessarily increasing in economic
development, and as a result they are opening more and more
slaughterhouses, liquor shops and brothels. In this way, the whole
civilization is being spoiled.

Saintly persons may freely associate with those who are poverty-

by association with saintly persons, very soon becomes unin-
terested in material desires, and the dirty things within the core of
his heart are cleansed away.
PURPORT
It is said, mahad-vicalanari nfnar grhinam dina-cetasam (Bhag.
10.8.4). The only business of a saintly person or sannydsi, a per-
son in the renounced order, is to preach Krsna consciousness. Sadhus,
saintly persons, want to preach to both the poor and the rich, but the
poor take more advantage of the sadhus’ preaching than the rich do. A
poor man receives sadhus very quickly, offers them obeisances, and tries
to take advantage of their presence, whereas a rich man keeps a big
greyhound dog at his door so that no one can enter his house. He posts a
sign saying ‘Beware of Dog” and avoids the association of saintly per-
sons, whereas a poor man keeps his door open for them and thus benefits


--- Page 195 ---
Text 18] Deliverance of the Yamala-arjuna Trees 191
by their association more than a rich man does. Because Narada Muni, in
his previous life, was the poverty-stricken son of a maidservant, he got
the association of saintly persons and later became the exalted Narada
Muni. This was his actual experience. Therefore, he is now comparing
the position of a poor man with that of a rich man.

Material life means that one forgets Krsna and that one increases in one’s
desires for sense gratification. But if one receives the advantage of in-
structions from saintly persons and forgets the importance of material
desires, one is automatically purified. Ceto-darpana-marjanam bhava-

terialistic person’s heart is purified, he cannot get rid of the pangs of

TRANSLATION

Saintly persons [sadhus] think of Krsna twenty-four hours a
day. They have no other interest. Why should people neglect the
association of such exalted spiritual personalities and try to associ-
ate with materialists, taking shelter of nondevotees, most of whom
are proud and rich?

PURPORT

A sadhu is one who is engaged in devotional service to the Lord

without deviation (bhajate mam ananya-bhak).
titiksavah karunikah
suhrdah sarva-dehinam
ajata-satravah santah
sadhavah sadhu-bhisanah
“The symptoms of a sadhu are that he is tolerant, merciful and friendly
to all living entities. He has no enemies, he is peaceful, he abides by the
scriptures, and all his characteristics are sublime.” (Bhag. 3.25.21) A
sadhu is suhrdah sarva-dehinam, the friend of everyone. Why then
should the rich, instead of associating with sadhus, waste their valuable
time in association with other rich men who are averse to spiritual life?
Both the poor man and the rich man can take advantage of the Krsna
consciousness movement, and here it is advised that everyone do so.
There is no profit in avoiding the association of the members of the
Krsna consciousness movement. Narottama dasa Thakura has said:
sat-sanga chadi’ kainu asate vilasa
te-karane lagila ye karma-bandha-pharisa


--- Page 197 ---
Text 19] Deliverance of the Yamala-arjuna Trees 193
If we give up the association of s@dhus, saintly persons engaged in Krsna
consciousness, and associate with persons seeking sense gratification and
accumulating wealth for this purpose, our life is spoiled. The word asat
refers to an avaisnava, one who is not a devotee of Krsna, and sat refers
to a Vaisnava, Krsna’s devotee. One should always seek the association of
Vaispavas and not spoil one’s life by mixing with avaisnavas. In
Bhagavad-gita (7.15), the distinction between Vaisnava and avaisnava is
enunciated:
na mar duskrtino mudhah
prapadyante naradhamah
madyaydapahrta-jaiana
asuram bhavam asritah
Anyone who is not surrendered to Krsna is a most sinful person
(duskrti), a rascal (miidha), and the lowest of men (naradhama).
Therefore one should not avoid the association of Vaisnavas, which is
now available all over the world in the form of the Krsna consciousness
movement.

PURPORT
When a sadhu chastises or punishes someone, he does not do so for
revenge. Maharaja Pariksit had inquired why Narada Muni was subject
to such a spirit of revenge (tamah). But this was not tamah, for Narada
Muni, in full knowledge of what was for the good of the two brothers,
wisely thought of how to cure them. Vaisnavas are good physicians. They
know how to protect a person from material disease. Thus they are never
in tamo-guna. Sa gunan samatityaitan brahma-bhiydya kalpate
(Bg. 14.26). Vaisnavas are always situated on the transcendental plat-
form, the Brahman platform. They cannot be subject to mistakes or the
influence of the modes of material nature. Whatever they do, after full
consideration, is meant just to lead everyone back home, back to
Godhead.

TRANSLATION

These two young men, Nalakiivara and Manigriva, are by for-
tune the sons of the great demigod Kuvera, but because of false
prestige and madness after drinking liquor, they are so fallen that
they are naked but cannot understand that they are. Therefore,
because they are living like trees (for trees are naked but are not
conscious), these two young men should receive the bodies of
trees. This will be proper punishment. Nonetheless, after they be-
come trees and until they are released, by my mercy they will have
remembrance of their past sinful activities. Moreover, by my
special favor, after the expiry of one hundred years by the
measurement of the demigods, they will be able to see the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vasudeva, face to face, and thus
revive their real position as devotees.

196 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 10, Ch. 10
PURPORT

A tree has no consciousness: when cut, it feels no pain. But Narada
Muni wanted the consciousness of Nalakiivara and Manigriva to con-
tinue, so that even after being released from the life of trees, they would
not forget the circumstances under which they had been punished.
Therefore, to bestow upon them special favor, Narada Muni arranged
things in such a way that after being released, they would be able to see
Krsna in Vrndavana and thus revive their dormant bhakti.

Each day of the demigods in the upper planetary system equals six
months of our measurement. Although the demigods in the upper plan-
etary system are attached to material enjoyment, they are all devotees,
and therefore they are called demigods. There are two kinds of persons,
namely the devas and the asuras. Asuras forget their relationship with
Krsna (@suram bhavam asritah), whereas the devas do not forget.

dvau bhita-sargau loke ’smin
daiva asura eva ca
visnu-bhaktah smrto daiva
dsuras tad-viparyayah
(Padma Purana)

The distinction between a pure devotee and a karma-misra devotee is
this: a pure devotee does not desire anything for material enjoyment,
whereas a mixed devotee becomes a devotee to become a first-class en-
joyer of this material world. One who is in direct touch with the Supreme
Personality of Godhead in devotional service remains pure, uncontami-
nated by material desires (anyabhildasita-sinyam jiana-karmady-
anavrtam).

By karma-misra-bhakti one is elevated to the celestial kingdom, by
Jjiana-misra-bhakti one is able to merge in the Brahman effulgence, and
by yoga-misra-bhakti one is able to realize the omnipotency of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. But pure bhakti does not depend on
karma, jiiana or yoga, for it simply consists of loving affairs. The libera-
tion of the bhakta, therefore, which is called not just mukti but vimukti,
surpasses the five other kinds of liberation —sayujya, sariapya, salokya,
sarsti and samipya. A pure devotee always engages in pure service

(anukulyena krsnanusilanam bhaktir uttama). Taking birth in the up-
per planetary system as a demigod is a chance to become a further
purified devotee and go back home, back to Godhead. Narada Muni in-
directly gave Manigriva and Nalakiivara the greatest opportunity by his
so-called curse.

“Although these two young men are the sons of the very rich
Kuvera and I have nothing to do with them, Devarsi Narada is My
very dear and affectionate devotee, and therefore because he
wanted Me to come face to face with them, I must do so for their
deliverance.”

PURPORT

Nalakiivara and Manigriva actually had nothing to do with devotional
service or seeing the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face, for
this is not an ordinary opportunity. It is not that because one is very rich
or learned or was born in an aristocratic family one will be able to see the
Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face. This is impossible. But in
this case, because Narada Muni desired that Nalakavara and Manigriva
see Vasudeva face to face, the Supreme Personality of Godhead wanted to
fulfill the words of His very dear devotee Narada Muni. If one seeks the
favor of a devotee instead of directly asking favors from the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, one is very easily successful. Srila Bhaktivinoda
Thakura has therefore recommended: vaisnava thakura tomara kukkura
bhuliya janaha more, krsna se tomara krsna dite para. One should desire
to become like a dog in strictly following a devotee. Krsna is in the hand
of a devotee. Adurlabham atma-bhaktau. Thus without the favor of a
devotee, one cannot directly approach Krsna, what to speak of engaging
in His service. Narottama dasa Thakura therefore sings, chadiya
vaisnava-sevd nistara payeche kebd: unless one becomes a servant of a
pure devotee, one cannot be delivered from the material condition of life.
In our Gaudiya Vaisnava society, following in the footsteps of Ripa
Gosvami, our first business is to seek shelter of a bona fide spiritual
master (adau gurv-asrayah).

atah sri-krsna-namadi
na bhaved grahyam indriyaih
sevonmukhe hi jihvadau

(Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 1.2.234)

Krsna’s name, attributes and form are Absolute Truth, existing before
the creation. Therefore, how can those who are created —that is, those
entrapped in bodies created of material elements—understand Krsna
perfectly? This is not possible. But, sevonmukhe hi jihvadau svayam eva
sphuraty adah: Krsna reveals Himself to those engaged in devotional
service. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (18.15) by the Lord
Himself: bhaktya mam abhijanati. Even the descriptions of Krsna in
Srimad-Bhagavatam are sometimes misunderstood by less intelligent
men with a poor fund of knowledge. Therefore, the best course by which
to know Him is to engage oneself in pure devotional activities. The more
one advances in devotional activities, the more one can understand Him
as He is. If from the material platform one could understand Krsna,
then, since Krsna is everything (sarvam khalv idam brahma), one could
understand Krsna by seeing anything within this material world. But
that is not possible.

Appearing in bodies like those of an ordinary fish, tortoise and
hog, You exhibit activities impossible for such creatures to per-
form —extraordinary, incomparable, transcendental activities of
unlimited power and strength. These bodies of Yours, therefore,
are not made of material elements, but are incarnations of Your
Supreme Personality. You are the same Supreme Personality of
Godhead, who have now appeared, with full potency, for the
benefit of all living entities within this material world.

PURPORT
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (4.7-8):
yada yada hi dharmasya

paritranaya sadhiindanm

Krsna appears as an incarnation when real spiritual life declines and
when rogues and thieves increase to disturb the situation of the world.
Unfortunate, less intelligent persons, bereft of devotional service, cannot
understand the Lord’s activities, and therefore such persons describe
these activities as kalpand—mythology or imagination —because they
are rascals and the lowest of men (na mar duskrtino muadhah
prapadyante naradhamah). Such men cannot understand that the events
described by Vyasadeva in the Puranas and other $astras are not fic-
titious or imaginary, but factual.

Krsna, in His full, unlimited potency, here shows that He is the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, for although the two trees were so
large and sturdy that even many elephants could not move them, Krsna,
as a child, exhibited such extraordinary strength that they fell down with

a great sound. From the very beginning, by killing Patana, Sakatasura
and Troavartasura, by causing the trees to fall, and by showing the en-
tire universe within His mouth, Krsna proved that He is the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. The lowest of men (mudhas), because of sinful
activities, cannot understand this, but devotees can accept it without a
doubt. Thus the position of a devotee is different from that of a
nondevotee.

The word parama-kalyana is significant because Krsna, in any of His
incarnations, appears in order to protect the sadhus (paritranaya
sadhiinam). The sadhus, saintly persons or devotees, are always harassed

by nondevotees, and Krsna appears in His incarnations to give them
relief. This is His first concern. If we study the history of Krsna’s life, we
shall find that for most of His life He predominantly engaged in killing
demons one after another.

Unless delivered or blessed by a devotee, one cannot realize that Krsna
is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Manusyanam sahasresu kascid

are so many siddhas or yogis who cannot understand Krsna; instead, they
misunderstand Him. But if one takes shelter of a devotee descending
from the parampara system of Narada (svayambhar naradah sambhuh),
one can then understand who is an incarnation of the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead. In this age, many pseudo incarnations are adver-

for persons who are servants of Narada and other servants of Krsna, no
one can understand who is God and who is not. This is confirmed by
Narottama dasa Thakura. Chadiya vaisnava-seva nistara payeche keba:
no one is delivered from the material conception of life unless favored by
a Vaisnava. Others can never understand, neither by speculation nor by
any other bodily or mental gymnastics.

PURPORT
Here the process of understanding the Supreme Personality of
Godhead is given. This process is bhakti.
S§ravanam kirtanam visnoh
smaranari pada-sevanam
arcanari vandanari dasyam
sakhyam atma-nivedanam
(Bhag. 1.5.23)
Everything should be engaged in the service of the Lord. Hrstkena
hrsikesa-sevanam bhaktir ucyate (Narada-paiicaratra). Everything—
the mind, the body and all the sense organs—should be engaged in
Krsna’s service. This is to be learned from expert devotees like Narada,
Svayambhii and Sambhu. This is the process. We cannot manufacture
our own way of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for
it is not that everything one manufactures or concocts will lead to under-
standing God. Such a proposition— yata mata, tata patha—is foolish.
Krsna says, bhaktyaham ekaya grahyah: “Only by executing the ac-
tivities of bhakti can one understand Me.” (Bhag. 11.14.21) This is
called anukiilyena krsnanusilanam, remaining engaged favorably in the
service of the Lord.

sri-Sukah uvaca—Sri Sukadeva Gosvami continued to speak; ittham—
in this way, as aforesaid; sarikirtitah—being glorified and praised;
tabhyam—by the two young demigods; bhagavan—the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead; gokula-iSvarah—the master of Gokula (because He
is sarva-loka-mahesvara); damna—Dby the rope; ca—also; ulikhale—

said; guhyakau—unto the two young demigods.

TRANSLATION

Sukadeva Gosvami continued: The two young demigods thus
offered prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although
Sri Krsna, the Supreme Godhead, is the master of all and was cer-
tainly Gokuleévara, the master of Gokula, He was bound to the
wooden mortar by the ropes of the gopis, and therefore, smiling
widely, He spoke to the sons of Kuvera the following words.

PURPORT

Krsna was smiling because He was thinking to Himself, “These two
young demigods fell from the higher planetary system to this planet, and
I have delivered them from the bondage of standing for a long time as
trees, but as for Me, I am bound by the ropes of the gopis and am subject
to their chastisements.” In other words, Krsna submits to being chastised
and bound by the gopis because of pure love and affection worthy of
being praised by a devotee in so many ways.

indeed; etat—this incident; rsina—by the great sage Narada; karuna-
atmand—because he was very, very kind to you; yat—which; sri-mada-

become blind; vagbhih—by words or by cursing; vibhramsah—falling
down from the heavenly planet to become arjuna trees here; anugrahah
krtah—this was a great favor done by him to you.
TRANSLATION
The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: The great saint
Narada Muni is very merciful. By his curse, he showed the greatest
favor to both of you, who were mad after material opulence and
who had thus become blind. Although you fell from the higher
planet Svargaloka and became trees, you were most favored by
him. I knew of all these incidents from the very beginning.
PURPORT
It is now confirmed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead that the
curse of a devotee is also to be regarded as mercy. As Krsna, God, is all-
good, 9 Vaisnava is also all-good. Whatever he does is good for everyone.
This is explained in the following verse.

sadhiinam—of devotees; sama-cittanam—who are equally dis-
posed toward everyone; sutaram—excessively, completely; mat-krta-
atmanam—of persons who are fully surrendered, determined to render
service unto Me; darsanat—simply by the audience; no bhavet
bandhah—freedom from all material bondage; pursah—of a person;
aksnoh—of the eyes; savituh yatha—as by being face to face with the
sun.

TRANSLATION

When one is face to face with the sun, there is no longer dark-
ness for one’s eyes. Similarly, when one is face to face with a
sadhu, a devotee, who is fully determined and surrendered to the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, one will no longer be subject to
material bondage.

PURPORT
As stated by Caitanya Mahaprabhu (Cc. Madhya 22.54):
‘sadhu-sariga,’ ‘sadhu-sarga’—sarva-sastre kaya
lava-matra sadhu-sarge sarva-siddhi haya
If by chance one meets a sadhu, a devotee, one’s life is immediately suc-
cessful, and one is freed from material bondage. It may be argued that
whereas someone may receive a sadhu with great respect, someone else
may not receive a sadhu with such respect. A sadhu, however, is always
equipoised toward everyone. Because of being a pure devotee, a sadhu is
always ready to deliver Krsna consciousness without discrimination. As
soon as one sees a sadhu, one naturally becomes free. Nonetheless, per-
sons who are too much offensive, who commit vaisnava-aparadhas, or
offenses to a sadhu, will have to take some time before being rectified.
This is also indicated herein.

PURPORT
The highest perfection of life is to come to the platform of devotional
service and always engage in devotional activities. Understanding this,
Nalakivara and Manigriva desired to attain that platform, and the
Supreme Personality of Godhead blessed them with the fulfillment of
their transcendental desire.

TRANSLATION

Sukadeva Gosvami said: The Supreme Personality of Godhead
having spoken to the two demigods in this way, they circamambu-
lated the Lord, who was bound to the wooden mortar, and offered
obeisances to Him. After taking the permission of Lord Krsna,
they returned to their respective homes.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Tenth Canto, Tenth
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “Deliverance of the
Yamala-arjuna Trees.”


--- Page 222 ---
CHAPTER ELEVEN
The Childhood Pastimes
of Krsna
This chapter describes how the inhabitants of Gokula left Gokula and
went to Vrndavana and how Krsna killed Vatsasura and Bakasura.

When the yamala-arjuna trees fell, they made a tremendous sound,
like that of falling thunderbolts. Being surprised, Krsna’s father, Nanda,
and the other elderly inhabitants of Gokula went to the spot, where they
saw the fallen trees and Krsna standing between them, bound to the
ulitkhala, the wooden mortar. They could find no cause for the trees’
having fallen and Krsna’s being there. They thought this might be the
work of some other asura who had met Krsna on this spot, and they in-
quired from the playmates of Krsna about how the whole incident had
taken place. The children properly described how everything had hap-
pened, but the elderly persons could not believe the story. Some of them,
however, thought that it might be true, since they had already seen many
wonderful incidents in connection with Krsna. Anyway, Nanda Maharaja
immediately released Krsna from the ropes.

In this way, Krsna, at every day and every moment, displayed wonder-
ful incidents to increase the parental affection of Nanda Maharaja and
Yasoda, who thus felt both surprise and joy. The breaking of the yamala-
arjunas was one of these wonderful pastimes.

One day a fruit vendor approached Nanda Maharaja’s house, and
Krsna gathered some food grains with His little palms and went to the
vendor to exchange the grains for fruit. On the way, almost all the grains
fell from His palms, only one or two grains remaining, but the fruit ven-
dor, out of full affection, accepted these grains in exchange for as much
fruit as Krsna could take. As soon as she did this, her basket became
filled with gold and jewels.

Thereafter, all the elderly gopas decided to leave Gokula because they
saw that in Gokula there was always some disturbance. They decided to
go to Vrndavana, Vraja-dhama, and the next day they all departed. In
Vrndavana, both Krsna and Balarama, after finishing Their childhood
pastimes, began to take charge of the calves and send them to the pastur-
ing grounds (go-carana). During this time, a demon named Vatsasura

219


--- Page 223 ---
220 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 10, Ch. 11
entered among the calves and was killed, and another asura, in the shape
of a big duck, was also killed. The playmates of Krsna narrated all these
stories to their mothers. The mothers could not believe their children,
Krsna’s playmates, but because of full affection they enjoyed these
narrations of Krsna’s activities.

TRANSLATION
There they saw the fallen yamala-arjuna trees on the ground,
but they were bewildered because even though they could directly
perceive that the trees had fallen, they could not trace out the
cause for their having done so.
PURPORT
Considering all the circumstances, had this been done by Krsna? He
was standing on the spot, and His playmates described that this had been
done by Him. Had Krsna actually done this, or were these merely
stories? This was a cause of bewilderment.

TRANSLATION

Krsna was bound by the rope to the ulikhala, the mortar, which
He was dragging. But how could He have pulled down the trees?
‘Who had actually done it? Where was the source for this incident?
Considering all these astounding things, the cowherd men were
doubtful and bewildered.

PURPORT

The cowherd men were very much agitated because the child Krsna,
after all, had been standing between the two trees, and if by chance the
trees had fallen upon Him, He would have been smashed. But He was
standing as He was, and still the things had happened, so who had done
all this? How could these events have happened in such a wonderful
way? These considerations were some of the reasons they were agitated
and bewildered. They thought, however, that by chance Krsna had been
saved by God so that nothing had happened to Him.

Then all the cowherd boys said: It is Krsna who has done this.
When He was in between the two trees, the mortar fell crosswise.
Krsna dragged the mortar, and the two trees fell down. After that,

two beautiful men came out of the trees. We have seen this with
our own eyes.
PURPORT
Krsna’s playmates wanted to inform Krsna’s father of the exact situa-
tion by explaining that not only did the trees break, but out of the broken
trees came two beautiful men. “All these things happened,” they said.
“We have seen them with our own eyes.”

TRANSLATION
Because of intense paternal affection, the cowherd men, headed
by Nanda, could not believe that Krsna could have uprooted the
trees in such a wonderful way. Therefore they could not put their
faith in the words of the boys. Some of the men, however, were in
doubt. ‘Since Krsna was predicted to equal Narayana,” they
thought, “‘it might be that He could have done it.”
PURPORT
One view was that it was impossible for a small boy like this to have
done such a thing as pulling down the trees. But there were doubts


--- Page 227 ---
224 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 10, Ch. 11
because Krsna had been predicted to equal Narayana. Therefore the
cowherd men were in a dilemma.

TRANSLATION
When Nanda Maharaja saw his own son bound with ropes to the
wooden mortar and dragging it, he smiled and released Krsna
from His bonds.
PURPORT
Nanda Maharaja was surprised that Yasoda, Krsna’s mother, could
have bound her beloved child in such a way. Krsna was exchanging love
with her. How then could she have been so cruel as to bind Him to the
wooden mortar? Nanda Maharaja understood this exchange of love, and
therefore he smiled and released Krsna. In other words, as Krsna, the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, binds a living entity in fruitive ac-
tivities, He binds mother Yaéoda and Nanda Maharija in parental affec-
tion. This is His pastime.

The gopis would say, “If You dance, my dear Krsna, then I shall
give You half a sweetmeat.”” By saying these words or by clapping
their hands, all the gopis encouraged Krsna in different ways. At
such times, although He was the supremely powerful Personality
of Godhead, He would smile and dance according to their desire,
as if He were a wooden doll in their hands. Sometimes He would
sing very loudly, at their bidding. In this way, Krsna came
completely under the control of the gopis.

Sometimes mother Yasoda and her gopi friends would tell
Krsna, “Bring this article’’ or “Bring that article.” Sometimes
they would order Him to bring a wooden plank, wooden shoes or a
wooden measuring pot, and Krsna, when thus ordered by the
mothers, would try to bring them. Sometimes, however, as if un-
able to raise these things, He would touch them and stand there.
Just to invite the pleasure of His relatives, He would strike His
body with His arms to show that He had sufficient strength.

To pure devotees throughout the world who could understand
His activities, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, ex-
hibited how much He can be subdued by His devotees, His ser-
vants. In this way He increased the pleasure of the Vrajavasis by
His childhood activities.


--- Page 230 ---
Text 10] The Childhood Pastimes of Krsna 227
PURPORT
That Krsna performed childhood activities to increase the pleasure of
His devotees was another transcendental humor. He exhibited these ac-
tivities not only to the inhabitants of Vrajabhiimi, but also to others, who
were captivated by His external potency and opulence. Both the internal
devotees, who were simply absorbed in love of Krsna, and the external
devotees, who were captivated by His unlimited potency, were informed
of Krsna’s desire to be submissive to His servants.

Once a woman selling fruit was calling, ‘“O inhabitants of Vra-
jabhiimi, if you want to purchase some fruits, come here!” Upon
hearing this, Krsna immediately took some grains and went to
barter as if He needed some fruits.
PURPORT
Aborigines generally go to the villagers to sell fruits. How much the
aborigines were attached to Krsna is here described. Krsna, to show His

favor to the aborigines, would immediately go purchase fruits, bartering
with paddy in His hand as He had seen others do.

woman; tasya—of Krsna; cyuta-dhanya—the paddy He brought to
barter having mostly fallen; kara-dvayam—palms of the hands; phalaih
apirayat—the fruit vendor filled His small palms with fruits; ratnaih—
in exchange for jewels and gold; phala-bhandam—the basket of fruit;
apiiri ca—filled.
TRANSLATION
While Krsna was going to the fruit vendor very hastily, most of
the grains He was holding fell. Nonetheless, the fruit vendor filled
Krsna’s hands with fruits, and her fruit basket was immediately
filled with jewels and gold.
PURPORT
In Bhagavad-gita (9.26) Krsna says:
patra puspari phalam toyar
yo me bhaktya prayacchati
tad aham bhakty-upahrtam
asnami prayatatmanah
Krsna is so kind that if anyone offers Him a leaf, a fruit, a flower or some
water, He will immediately accept it. The only condition is that these
things should be offered with bhakti (yo me bhaktya prayacchati).

Text 12] The Childhood Pastimes of Krsna 229
Otherwise, if one is puffed up with false prestige, thinking, “I have so
much opulence, and I am giving something to Krsna,” one’s offering will
not be accepted by Krsna. The fruit vendor, although a woman belonging
to the poor aborigine class, dealt with Krsna with great affection, saying,
“Krsna, You have come to me to take some fruit in exchange for grains.
All the grains have fallen, but still You may take whatever You like.”
Thus she filled Krsna’s palms with whatever fruits He could carry. In ex-
change, Krsna filled her whole basket with jewels and gold.

From this incident one should learn that for anything offered to Krsna
with love and affection, Krsna can reciprocate many millions of times
over, both materially and spiritually. The basic principle involved is an
exchange of love. Therefore Krsna teaches in Bhagavad-gita (9.27):

yat karosi yad asnasi
yaj juhosi dadasi yat
yat tapasyasi kaunteya
tat kurusva mad-arpanam
“0 son of Kunti, all that you do, all that you eat, all that you offer and
give away, as well as all austerities that you may perform, should be done
as an offering unto Me.” With love and affection, one should try to give
something to Krsna from one’s source of income. Then one’s life will be
successful. Krsna is full in all opulences; He does not need anything
from anyone. But if one is prepared to give something to Krsna, that is
for one’s own benefit. The example given in this connection is that when
one’s real face is decorated, the reflection of one’s face is automatically
decorated. Similarly, if we try to serve Krsna with all our opulences, we,
as parts and parcels or reflections of Krsna, will become happy in ex-
change. Krsna is always happy, for He is atmdarama, fully satisfied with
His own opulence.

Once, after the uprooting of the yamala-arjuna trees, Rohini-
devi went to call Rama and Krsna, who had both gone to the river-
side and were playing with the other boys with deep attention.
PURPORT
Mother Yasoda was more attached to Krsna and Balarama than
Rohinidevi was, although Rohinidevi was the mother of Balarama.
Mother Yasoda sent Rohinidevi to call Rama and Krsna from Their play,
since it was the right time for lunch. Therefore Rohinidevi went to call
Them, breaking Their engagement in play.

Yasodar presayam asa. These very words show that since Krsna and

Rohini thought that if (36008 called They would have to return, for

PURPORT
It appears that Nanda Maharaja regularly took his food with his two
sons, Krsna and Balarama. ३5०१३ told the other boys, “Now you should
go to your homes.” Father and son generally sit together, so mother
Yasoda requested Krsna and Balarama to return, and she advised the
other boys to go home so that their parents would not have to wait for
them.

ing all day, Your body has become covered with dust and sand.
Therefore, come back, take Your bath and cleanse Yourself. Today
the moon is conjoined with the auspicious star of Your birth.
Therefore, be pure and give cows in charity to the brahmanas.
PURPORT
It is a custom of Vedic culture that whenever there is any auspicious
ceremony, one should give valuable cows in charity to the brahmanas.
Therefore mother YaSoda requested Krsna, ‘Instead of being en-
thusiastic in playing, now please come and be enthusiastic in charity.”

very much advanced in spiritual life, one should not give up these three
duties. To observe one’s birthday ceremony, one should do something in
terms of one of these three items (yajiia, dana or tapah), or all of them
together.

Just see how all Your playmates of Your own age have been
cleansed and decorated with beautiful ornaments by their mothers.
You should come here, and after You have taken Your bath, eaten
Your lunch and been decorated with ornaments, You may play with
Your friends again.

PURPORT

Generally young boys are competitive. If one friend has done some-
thing, another friend also wants to do something. Therefore mother
Yaéoda pointed out how Krsna’s playmates were decorated, so that Krsna
might be induced to decorate Himself like them.

My dear Maharaja Pariksit, because of intense love and affection,
mother Yaéoda, Krsna’s mother, considered Krsna, who was at the
peak of all opulences, to be her own son. Thus she took Krsna by
the hand, along with Balarama, and brought Them home, where
she performed her duties by fully bathing Them, dressing Them
and feeding Them.
PURPORT
Krsna is always neat, clean and opulent and does not need to be
washed, bathed or dressed, yet mother Yasoda, because of affection, con-
sidered Him her ordinary child and did her duties to keep her son
brilliant.

TRANSLATION

All these incidents are being caused by some unknown demon.
Before he comes here to create another disturbance, it is our duty
to go somewhere else with the boys until there are no more
disturbances.

PURPORT

Upananda suggested, ‘By the mercy of Lord Visnu, Krsna has always
been saved from so many dangerous incidents. Now let us leave this
place and go someplace where we may worship Lord Visnu undisturbed,
before there is another cause of death from some demon who may attack
us.” A devotee desires only that he may execute devotional service un-
disturbed. Actually we see, however, that even during the presence of
Krsna, when Nanda Maharaja and the other cowherd men had the
Supreme Personality of Godhead in their presence, there were distur-
bances. Of course, in every case, Krsna came out victorious. The instruc-
tion we may derive from this is that we should not be disturbed by
so-called disturbances. There have been so many disturbances to our
Krsna consciousness movement, but we cannot give up our forward
march. On the contrary, people are receiving this movement very en-
thusiastically all over the world, and they are purchasing literature about
Krsna consciousness with redoubled energy. Thus there are both en-
couragements and disturbances. This was so even in Krsna’s time.

Between Nandeévara and Mahavana is a place named Vrndavana.
This place is very suitable because it is lush with grass, plants and
creepers for the cows and other animals. It has nice gardens and
tall mountains and is full of facilities for the happiness of all the
gopas and gopis and our animals.
PURPORT
Vrndavana is situated between Nande$vara and Mahavana. Formerly
the cowherd men had shifted to Mahavana, but still there were distur-
bances. Therefore the cowherd men selected Vrndavana, which was be-
tween the two villages, and decided to go there.

great care and sounded bugles made of horn. O King Pariksit, in
this way, with bugles vibrating all around, the cowherd men, ac-
companied by their priests, began their journey.
PURPORT
In this connection it is to be noted that although the inhabitants of
Gokula were mostly cowherd men and cultivators, they knew how to de-
fend themselves from danger and how to give protection to the women,
the old men, the cows and the children, as well as to the brahminical
purohitas.

Krsna.

with Them on one bullock cart. In this situation, they all looked
very beautiful.

It appears that mother 38008 and Rohini could not be separated from
Krsna and Balarama even for a moment. They used to pass their time
either by taking care of Krsna and Balarama or by chanting about Their
pastimes. Thus mother Ya$oda and Rohini looked very beautiful.

TRANSLATION
In this way, Krsna and Balarama, acting like small boys and talk-
ing in half-broken language, gave transcendental pleasure to all
the inhabitants of Vraja. In due course of time, They became old
enough to take care of the calves.
PURPORT
As soon as Krsna and Balarama were a little grown up, They were
meant for taking care of the calves. Although born of a very well-to-do
family, They still had to take care of the calves. This was the system of
education. Those who were not born in brahmana families were not
meant for academic education. The brahmanas were trained in a literary,
academic education, the ksatriyas were trained to take care of the state,
and the vaiSyas learned how to cultivate the land and take care of the
cows and calves. There was no need to waste time going to school to be
falsely educated and later increase the numbers of the unemployed.
Krsna and Balarama taught us by Their personal behavior. Krsna took
care of the cows and played His flute, and Balarama took care of
agricultural activities with a plow in His hand.

TRANSLATION

Sometimes Krsna and Balarama would play on Their flutes,
sometimes They would throw ropes and stones devised for getting
fruits from the trees, sometimes They would throw only stones,
and sometimes, Their ankle bells tinkling, They would play foot-
ball with fruits like bael and amalaki. Sometimes They would cover
Themselves with blankets and imitate cows and bulls and fight
with one another, roaring loudly, and sometimes They would imi-
tate the voices of the animals. In this way They enjoyed sporting,
exactly like two ordinary human children.

PURPORT

Vrndavana is full of peacocks. Kitjat-kokila-hamsa-sarasa-ganakirne
mayirakule. The Vrndavana forest is always full of cuckoos, ducks,
swans, peacocks, cranes and also monkeys, bulls and cows. So Krsna and
Balarama used to imitate the sounds of these animals and enjoy sporting.

When the Supreme Personality of Godhead saw that the demon
had assumed the form of a calf and entered among the groups of
other calves, He pointed out to Baladeva, ‘‘Here is another
demon.” Then He very slowly approached the demon, as if He did
not understand the demon’s intentions.
PURPORT
The import of the words mugdha iva is that although Krsna knows
everything, here He pretended that He did not understand why the
demon had entered among the calves, and He informed Baladeva by a
sign.

Thereafter, Sri Krsna caught the demon by the hind legs and
tail, twirled the demon’s whole body very strongly until the demon
was dead, and threw him into the top of a kapittha tree, which then
fell down, along with the body of the demon, who had assumed a
great form.
PURPORT
Krsna killed the demon in such a way as to get the kapittha fruits to
fall so that He and Balarama and the other boys could take advantage of
the opportunity to eat them. The kapittha is sometimes called ksatbel-
phala. The pulp of this fruit is very palatable. It is sweet and sour, and
everyone likes it.

day, and although these were serious, killing the demons one after
another appeared to be His daily routine work.

Although Balarama can do everything, because of intense affection for
His brother He was momentarily bewildered. A similar thing is stated to
have happened in connection with rukmini-harana, the kidnapping of
Rukmini. When Krsna, after kidnapping Rukmini, was attacked by all
the kings, Rukmini was momentarily bewildered, until the Lord took the
proper steps.

Krsna, who was the father of Lord Brahma but who was acting as
the son of a cowherd man, became like fire, burning the root of
the demon’s throat, and the demon Bakasura immediately dis-
gorged Him. When the demon saw that Krsna, although having
been swallowed, was unharmed, he immediately attacked Krsna
again with his sharp beak.
PURPORT
Although Krsna is always as soft as a lotus, within the throat of
Bakasura He created a burning sensation of being hotter than fire. Al-
though Krsna’s whole body is sweeter than sugar candy, Bakasura tasted
bitterness and therefore immediately vomited Krsna up. As stated in
Bhagavad-gita (4.11), ye yatha mari prapadyante tams tathaiva
bhajamy aham. When Krsna is accepted as an enemy, He becomes the
most intolerable object for the nondevotee, who cannot tolerate Krsna
within or without. Here this is shown by the example of Bakasura.

beak, and in the presence of all the cowherd boys Krsna very easily
bifurcated Him, as a child splits a blade of virana grass. By thus
killing the demon, Krsna very much pleased the denizens of
heaven.

TRANSLATION
Just as the senses are pacified when consciousness and life
return, so when Krsna was freed from this danger, all the boys, in-
cluding Balarama, thought that their life had been restored. They
embraced Krsna in good consciousness, and then they collected
their own calves and returned to Vrajabhiimi, where they declared
the incident loudly.

260 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 10, Ch. 11
PURPORT
It was the practice of the inhabitants of Vrajabhtimi to compose poetry
about the incidents that occurred in the forest when Krsna performed
His different activities of killing the asuras. They would compose all the
stories in poetry or have this done by professional poets, and then they
would sing about these incidents. Thus it is written here that the boys
sang very loudly.

TRANSLATION
When the cowherd men and women heard about the killing of
Bakasura in the forest, they were very much astonished. Upon
seeing Krsna and hearing the story, they received Krsna very
eagerly, thinking that Krsna and the other boys had returned from
the mouth of death. Thus they looked upon Krsna and the boys
with silent eyes, not wanting to turn their eyes aside now that the
boys were safe.
PURPORT
Because of intense love for Krsna, the cowherd men and women
simply remained silent, thinking of how Krsna and the boys had been

saved. The cowherd men and women looked upon Krsna and the boys
and did not desire to turn their eyes aside.

The cowherd men, headed by Nanda Maharaja, began to con-
template: It is very astonishing that although this boy Krsna has
many times faced many varied causes of death, by the grace of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead it was these causes of fear that
were killed, instead of Him.
PURPORT
The cowherd men innocently thought, “Because our Krsna is inno-
cent, the causes of death that appeared before Him were themselves
killed instead of Krsna. This is the greatest grace of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead.”

Although the causes of death, the daityas, were very fierce, they
could not kill this boy Krsna. Rather, because they came to kill in-
nocent boys, as soon as they approached they themselves were
killed, exactly like flies attacking a fire.
PURPORT
Nanda Maharaja innocently thought, ‘Perhaps this boy Krsna for-
merly killed all these demons, and therefore in this life they are envious
and are attacking Him. But Krsna is a fire, and they are flies, and in a
fight between fire and flies, the fire is always victorious.” Fighting is al-
ways taking place between the demons and the power of the Supreme
Personality. Paritrandya sadhinam vindsaya ca duskrtam (Bg. 4.8).
Anyone who is against the control of the Supreme Personality of God-
head must be killed, life after life. Ordinary living beings are subject to
karma, but the Supreme Personality of Godhead is always victorious over
the demons.

The words of persons in full knowledge of Brahman never be-

dicted we are now actually experiencing in all detail.

PURPORT

The purpose of human life is indicated in the Brahma-siitra: athato
brahma-jijiasa. To make one’s life perfect—in the past, present and
future —one must learn about Brahman. Because of intense affection,
Nanda Maharaja could not understand Krsna as He is. Gargamuni was
able to know everything, past, present and future, by studying the
Vedas, but Nanda Maharaja could not understand Krsna directly. Be-
cause of his intense love for Krsna, he forgot who Krsna was and could
not understand Krsna’s potency. Although Krsna is Narayana Himself,
Gargamuni did not disclose this. Thus Nanda Maharaja appreciated the
words of Gargamuni, but because of his deep affection he could not
understand who Krsna was, although Gargamuni had said that Krsna’s
qualities would be exactly like those of Narayana.

In this way all the cowherd men, headed by Nanda Maharaja, en-

transcendental pleasure, and they could not even perceive material
tribulations.
PURPORT
Here is an instruction about the result of studying or discussing the
krsna-lilas that appear in Srimad-Bhagavatam. Sadyo hrdy avarudhyate
‘tra krtibhih susrusubhis tat-ksanat (Bhag. 1.1.2). Nanda Maharaja and
Yasoda in Vrndavana appeared like ordinary persons of this material
world, but they never felt the tribulations of this world, although they
sometimes met many dangerous situations created by the demons. This is
a practical example. If we follow in the footsteps of Nanda Maharaja and
the gopas, we can all be happy simply by discussing the activities of
Krsna.
anarthopasamari saksad

Vyasadeva has given this literature so that everyone may understand
one’s transcendental position simply by discussing bhagavata-katha.
Even at the present moment, everyone everywhere can be happy and
free from material tribulations by following Srimad-Bhagavatam. There
is no need of austerities and penances, which in this age are very difficult
to perform. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has therefore declared, sarvatma-
snapanar param vijayate Sri-krsna-sarnkirtanam. By our Krsna con-
sciousness movement, we are trying to distribute Srimad-Bhagavatam so
that anyone in any part of the world can be absorbed in the Krsna con-
sciousness movement by chanting and hearing about the activities of
Krsna and be free from all material tribulations.

In this way Krsna and Balarama passed Their childhood age in
Vrajabhiimi by engaging in activities of childish play, such as play-
ing hide-and-seek, constructing a make-believe bridge on the
ocean, and jumping here and there like monkeys.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Tenth Canto, Eleventh
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “The Childhood Pastimes
of Krsna.”

CHAPTER TWELVE
The Killing of the Demon Aghasura

This chapter describes in detail Krsna’s pastime of killing Aghasura.

One day Krsna wanted to enjoy a picnic lunch within the forest, and
therefore He went out early into the forest with the other cowherd boys,
accompanied by their respective groups of calves. While they were enjoy-
ing their picnic, Aghasura, the younger brother of Pitana and Bakasura,
appeared there, desiring to kill Krsna and His companions. The demon,
who had been sent by Karisa, assumed the form of a python, expanding
himself to a length of eight miles and the height of a mountain, his
mouth seeming to extend from the surface of the earth to the heavenly
planets. Having assumed this feature, Aghasura lay on the road. Krsna’s
friends, the cowherd boys, thought that the demon’s form was one of the
beautiful spots of Vrndavana. Thus they wanted to enter within the
mouth of this gigantic python. The gigantic figure of the python became
a subject for their sporting pleasure, and they began to laugh, confident
that even if this figure were dangerous, Krsna was there to protect them.
In this way, they proceeded toward the mouth of the gigantic figure.

Krsna knew everything about Aghasura, and therefore He wanted to
forbid His friends to enter the demon’s mouth, but in the meantime all
the cowherd boys, along with their groups of calves, entered the mouth
of that gigantic figure. Krsna was waiting outside, and Aghasura was
waiting for Krsna, thinking that as soon as Krsna entered he would close
his mouth so that everyone would die. While waiting for Krsna, he
refrained from swallowing the boys. In the meantime, Krsna was think-
ing of how to save the boys and kill Aghasura. Thus He entered the
mouth of the gigantic asura, and when He was within the demon’s mouth
along with His friends, He expanded His body to such an extent that the
asura suffocated and died. After this, Krsna, by casting His nectarean
glance upon His friends, brought them back to life, and with pleasure
they all came out unhurt. Thus Krsna encouraged all the demigods, and
they expressed their pleasure and happiness. For a crooked, sinful per-
son there is no scope for sayujya-mukti, or becoming one with the

267


--- Page 270 ---
268 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 10, Ch. 12
effulgence of Krsna, but because the Supreme Personality of Godhead
entered the body of Aghasura, by His touch this demon got the oppor-
tunity to merge into the existence of the Brahman effulgence and thus
attain sayujya-mukti.

When this pastime was performed, Krsna was only five years old. One
year later, when He was six years old and He stepped into the pauganda
age, this pastime was disclosed to the inhabitants of Vraja. Pariksit
Maharaja inquired, “Why is it that this pastime was disclosed only after
one year and yet the inhabitants of Vraja thought that it had been per-
formed that very day?’ With this question, the Twelfth Chapter ends.

TRANSLATION

Along with the cowherd boys and their own groups of calves,
Krsna came out with an unlimited number of calves assembled.
Then all the boys began to sport in the forest in a greatly playful
spirit.

PURPORT

In this verse the words krsna-vatsair asarikhydtaih are significant.
The word asankhyata means “‘unlimited.” Krsna’s calves were un-
limited. We may speak of hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands,
hundreds of thousands, millions, billions, trillions, tens of trillions, and
80 on, but when we go further to speak of numbers impossible for us to
count, we are speaking of unlimited numbers. Such unlimited numbers
are indicated here by the word asarnkhyataih. Krsna is unlimited, His po-
tency is unlimited, His cows and calves are unlimited, and His space is
unlimited. Therefore He is described in Bhagavad-gita as Parabrahman.
The word brahman means “unlimited,” and Krsna is the Supreme Un-
limited, Parabrahman. Therefore, we should not consider the statements
of this verse to be mythological. They are factual, but inconceivable.
Krsna can accommodate an unlimited number of calves and an unlimited
measurement of space. This is neither mythological nor false, but if we
study Krsna’s potency with our limited knowledge, that potency will
never be possible to understand. Atah Sri-krsna-namadi na bhaved
grahyam indriyaih (Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 1.2.109). Our senses can-
not perceive how He could keep an unlimited number of calves and cows
and have unlimited space in which to do so. But this is answered in the
Brhad-bhagavatamrta:

Sri Sanitana Gosvami, in the Brhad-bhagavatamrta, states that since
everything about Krsna is unlimited, nothing is impossible for Him. It is
in this sense that we have to understand this verse.

then again threw farther away; hasantah ca punah daduh—when they

when the owner sometimes cried, his bag was given to him again.

TRANSLATION

All the cowherd boys used to steal one another’s lunch bags.
‘When a boy came to understand that his bag had been taken away,
the other boys would throw it farther away, to a more distant place,
and those standing there would throw it still farther. When the
proprietor of the bag became disappointed, the other boys would
laugh, the proprietor would cry, and then the bag would be
returned.

PURPORT

This kind of playing and stealing among boys still exists even in the
material world because this kind of sporting pleasure is present in the
spiritual world, from which this idea of enjoyment emanates. Janmady
asya yatah (Vedanta-sitra 1.1.2). This same enjoyment is displayed by
Krsna and His associates in the spiritual world, but there the enjoyment
is eternal, whereas here, on the material platform, it is temporary; there
the enjoyment is Brahman, whereas here the enjoyment is jada. The
Krsna consciousness movement is meant to train one how to transfer
oneself from the jada to the Brahman, because human life is meant for
this purpose. Athdato brahma-jijiiasa (Vedanta-sitra 1.1.1). Krsna comes
down to teach us how we can enjoy with Him on the spiritual platform, in
the spiritual world. Not only does He come, but He personally displays
His pastimes in Vrndavana and attracts people to spiritual enjoyment.

repeatedly touching Krsna.

TRANSLATION

All the boys would be differently engaged. Some boys blew their
flutes, and others blew bugles made of horn. Some imitated the
buzzing of the bumblebees, and others imitated the voice of the
cuckoo. Some boys imitated flying birds by running after the
birds’ shadows on the ground, some imitated the beautiful move-
ments and attractive postures of the swans, some sat down with the
ducks, sitting silently, and others imitated the dancing of the
peacocks. Some boys attracted young monkeys in the trees, some
jumped into the trees, imitating the monkeys, some made faces as
the monkeys were accustomed to do, and others jumped from one
branch to another. Some boys went to the waterfalls and crossed
over the river, jumping with the frogs, and when they saw their
own reflections on the water they would laugh. They would also
condemn the sounds of their own echoes. In this way, all the
cowherd boys used to play with Krsna, who is the source of the
Brahman effulgence for jianis desiring to merge into that
effulgence, who is the Supreme Personality of Godhead for


--- Page 278 ---
276 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 10, Ch. 12
devotees who have accepted eternal servitorship, and who for ordi-
nary persons is but another ordinary child. The cowherd boys,
having accumulated the results of pious activities for many lives,
were able to associate in this way with the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. How can one explain their great fortune?
PURPORT

As recommended by Srila Ripa Gosvami, tasmat kendapy upayena
manah krsne nivesayet (Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 1.2.4). Somehow or
other, whether one thinks of Krsna as an ordinary human child, as the
source of the Brahman effulgence, as the origin of Paramatma, or as the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, one should concentrate one’s full at-
tention upon the lotus feet of Krsna. That is also the instruction of
Bhagavad-gita (18.66): sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekari Saranam
vraja. Srimad-Bhagavatam is the easiest way of directly approaching
Krsna. [svarah sadyo hrdy avarudhyate ‘tra krtibhih susrasubhis tat-
ksanat (Bhag. 1.1.2). Diverting even a little of one’s attention toward
Krsna and activities in Krsna consciousness immediately enables one to
achieve the highest perfection of life. This is the purpose of the
Krsna consciousness movement. Lokasydjanato vidvams cakre satvata-
samhitam (Bhag. 1.7.6). The secret of success is unknown to people in
general, and therefore Srila Vyasadeva, being compassionate toward the
poor souls in this material world, especially in this age of Kali, has given
us the Srimad-Bhagavatam. Srimad-bhagavatarh puranam amalari yad
৬০৫502৮৫727 priyam (Bhag. 12.13.18). For Vaisnavas who are some-
what advanced, or who are fully aware of the glories and potencies of the
Lord, Srimad-Bhagavatam is a beloved Vedic literature. After all, we
have to change this body (tatha dehantara-praptih). If we do not care
about Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam, we do not know what the
next body will be. But if one adheres to these two books — Bhagavad-gita
and Srimad-Bhagavatam —one is sure to obtain the association of Krsna
in the next life (tyaktva dehari punar janma naiti mam eti so ’rjuna).
Therefore, distribution of Srimad-Bhagavatam all over the world is a
great welfare activity for theologians, philosophers, transcendentalists
and yogis (yoginam api sarvesam), as well as for people in general.
Janma-labhah parah purisam ante narayana-smrtih (Bhag. 2.1.6): if
we can somehow or other remember Krsna, Narayana, at the end of life,
our life will be successful.

TRANSLATION
Yogis may undergo severe austerities and penances for many
births by practicing yama, niyama, asana and pranayama, none of
which are easily performed. Yet in due course of time, when these
yogis attain the perfection of controlling the mind, they will still
be unable to taste even a particle of dust from the lotus feet of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. What then can we describe
about the great fortune of the inhabitants of Vrajabhami,
Vrndavana, with whom the Supreme Personality of Godhead per-
sonally lived and who saw the Lord face to face?
PURPORT
We can simply imagine the great fortune of the inhabitants of
Vrndavana. It is impossible to describe how, after many, many births of
pious activities, they have become so fortunate.

My dear King Pariksit, thereafter there appeared a great demon
named Aghasura, whose death was being awaited even by the
demigods. The demigods drank nectar every day, but still they
feared this great demon and awaited his death. This demon could
not tolerate the transcendental pleasure being enjoyed in the
forest by the cowherd boys.

PURPORT

One may ask how Krgna’s pastimes could be interrupted by a demon.
Srila Viévanatha Cakravarti Thakura answers this question by saying
that although the transcendental pleasure being enjoyed by the cowherd
boys could not be stopped, unless they stopped the transcendental

pleasure of their various activities they could not eat their lunch.
Therefore at lunchtime Aghasura appeared by the arrangement of
yogamdyd, so that for the time being they could stop their activities and
take lunch. Changing varieties are the mother of enjoyment. The
cowherd boys would continuously play, then stop, and then again enjoy
in a different way. Therefore every day a demon would come and inter-
rupt their sporting pastimes. The demon would be killed, and then the
boys would engage again in their transcendental pastimes.

Therefore, in order to please them both, I shall kill this Krsna,
along with His assistants, the other cowherd boys.”

Vrajabhiimi, for whom these boys are the life and soul, will auto-
matically die. If there is no life, there is no need for the body; con-
sequently, when their sons are dead, naturally all the inhabitants
of Vraja will die.

road, expecting to swallow Krsna and His associates the cowherd
boys.

like fire.

spot of Vrndavana. Thereafter, they imagined it to be similar to
the mouth of a great python. In other words, the boys, unafraid,
thought that it was a statue made in the shape of a great python for
the enjoyment of their pastimes.
PURPORT
Some of the boys, upon seeing this wonderful phenomenon, thought
that it was in fact a python, and they were fleeing from the spot. But
others said, “Why are you fleeing? It is not possible that a python like
this is staying here. This is a spot of beauty for sporting.” This is what
they imagined.

derful creature laying before them. Was it dead, or was it actually a liv-
ing python trying to swallow them up?

hands, they entered the mouth of the python.

PURPORT
After talking about the terrible animal this way and that way, they
decided to enter the demon’s mouth. They had full faith in Krsna be-
cause they had experienced how Krsna had saved them from the mouth
of Bakasura. Now, here was another asura, Aghasura. Therefore, they
wanted to enjoy the sport of entering the demon’s mouth and being saved
by Krsna, the enemy of Bakasura.

In the meantime, while Krsna was considering how to stop them,
all the cowherd boys entered the mouth of the demon. The demon,
however, did not swallow them, for he was thinking of his own
relatives who had been killed by Krsna and was just waiting for
Krsna to enter his mouth.

body, he must have had a very strong appetite); ghrna-arditah—
therefore, being compassionate due to causeless mercy; dista-krtena—by

TRANSLATION
Krsna saw that all the cowherd boys, who did not know anyone
but Him as their Lord, had now gone out of His hand and were
helpless, having entered like straws into the fire of the abdomen of
Aghasura, who was death personified. It was intolerable for Krsna
to be separated from His friends the cowherd boys. Therefore, as
if seeing that this had been arranged by His internal potency,
Krsna was momentarily struck with wonder and unsure of what
to do.

jAatva—and deciding what to do; avisat—entered; tundam—within the
mouth of the demon; asesa-drk harih—Krsna, who has unlimited po-
tency, could understand past, future and present.

TRANSLATION

Now, what was to be done? How could both the killing of this
demon and the saving of the devotees be performed simul-
taneously? Krsna, being unlimitedly potent, decided to wait for an
intelligent means by which He could simultaneously save the boys
and kill the demon. Then He entered the mouth of Aghasura.

PURPORT

Krsna is known as ananta-virya-sarvajiia because everything is
known to Him. Because He knows everything perfectly well, it was not
difficult for Him to find a means by which He could save the boys and at
the same time kill the demon. Thus He also decided to enter the demon’s
mouth.

TRANSLATION
When the invincible Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna,
heard the demigods crying ‘‘Alas! Alas!” from behind the clouds,
He immediately enlarged Himself within the demon’s throat, just
to save Himself and the cowherd boys, His own associates, from
the demon who wished to smash them.

292 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 10, Ch. 12
PURPORT
Such are the acts of Krsna. Paritrandya sadhindam vindsaya ca
duskrtam (Bg. 4.8). By enlarging Himself within the throat of the
demon, Krsna suffocated and killed him and at the same time saved Him-
self and His associates from imminent death and also saved the demigods
from lamentation.

Then, because Krsna had increased the size of His body, the
demon extended his own body to a very large size. Nonetheless, his
breathing stopped, he suffocated, and his eyes rolled here and
there and popped out. The demon’s life air, however, could not
pass through any outlet, and therefore it finally burst out through
8 hole in the top of the demon’s head.

TRANSLATION

From the body of the gigantic python, a glaring effulgence came
out, illuminating all directions, and stayed individually in the sky
until Krsna came out from the corpse’s mouth. Then, as all the
demigods looked on, this effulgence entered into Krgna’s body.

PURPORT

Apparently the serpent named Aghasura, because of having received
association with Krsna, attained mukti by entering Krsna’s body. Enter-
ing the body of Krsna is called sayujya-mukti, but later verses prove that
Aghasura, like Dantavakra and others, received sarapya-mukti. This has
been broadly described by Srila Viévanatha Cakravarti Thakura with
references from the Vaisnava-tosani of Srila Jiva Gosvami. Aghasura at-
tained saripya-mukti, being promoted to the Vaikuntha planets to live
with the same four-armed bodily features as Vignu. The explanation of
how this is so may be summarized as follows.

The effulgence came out from the python’s body and became purified,
attaining spiritual suddha-sattva, freedom from material contamination,
because Krsna had stayed within the serpent’s body, even after the ser-
pent’s death. One may doubt that such a demon, full of mischievous ac-
tivities, could attain the liberation of saripya or sdyujya, and one may be
astonished about this. But Krsna is so kind that in order to drive away
such doubts, He had the effulgence, the individual life of the python.


--- Page 297 ---
Text 34] The Killing of the Demon Aghasura 295
wait for some time in its individuality, in the presence of all the
demigods.

Krsna is the full effulgence, and every living being is part and parcel
of that effulgence. As proved here, the effulgence in every living being is
individual. For some time, the effulgence remained outside the demon’s
body, individually, and did not mix with the whole effulgence, the
brahmajyoti. The Brahman effulgence is not visible to material eyes, but
to prove that every living being is individual, Krsna had this individual
effulgence stay outside the demon’s body for some time, for everyone to
see. Then Krsna proved that anyone killed by Him attains liberation,
whether sayujya, saripya, samipya or whatever.

But the liberation of those who are on the transcendental platform of
love and affection is vimukti, special liberation. Thus the serpent first en-
tered the body of Krsna personally and mixed with the Brahman
effulgence. This merging is called sa@yujya-mukti. But from later verses
we find that Aghasura attained saripya-mukti. Text 38 explains that
Aghasura attained a body exactly like that of Visnu, and the verse after
that also clearly states that he attained a completely spiritual body like
that of Narayana. Therefore in two or three places the Bhagavatam has
confirmed that Aghasura attained saripya-mukti. One may then argue,
How is it that he mixed with the Brahman effulgence? The answer is that
as Jaya and Vijaya, after three births, again attained saripya-mukti and
association with the Lord, Aghasura received a similar liberation.

TRANSLATION

Thereafter, everyone being pleased, the demigods began to
shower flowers from Nandana-kanana, the celestial dancing girls
began to dance, and the Gandharvas, who are famous for singing,
offered songs of prayer. The drummers began to beat their ket-
tledrums, and the briahmanas offered Vedic hymns. In this way,
both in the heavens and on earth, everyone began to perform his
own duties, glorifying the Lord.

PURPORT

Everyone has some particular duty. The $astra has concluded
(nirapitah) that everyone should glorify the Supreme Personality of
Godhead by his own qualifications. If you are a singer, always glorify the
Supreme Lord by singing very nicely. If you are a musician, glorify the
Supreme Lord by playing musical instruments. Svanusthitasya dhar-
masya sarisiddhir hari-tosanam (Bhag. 1.2.13). The perfection of life is
to satisfy the Personality of Godhead. Therefore, beginning from this
earth up to the celestial kingdom, everyone engaged in glorifying the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. The decision of all great saintly per-
sons is that whatever qualifications one has acquired should be utilized to
glorify the Supreme Lord.

tions of the qualities of the Lord, who is defined in choice poetry.”
(Bhag. 1.5.22) This is the perfection of life. One should be trained how
to glorify the Supreme Personality of Godhead by one’s respective
qualities. Education, austerity, penance or, in the modern world, busi-
ness, industry, education and so on—all should be engaged in glorifying
the Lord. Then everyone in the world will be happy.

Krsna comes, therefore, to exhibit His transcendental activities so that
people may have the chance to glorify Him in every respect. To under-
stand how to glorify the Lord is actual research work. It is not that every-
thing should be understood without God. That is condemned.

TRANSLATION
This incident of Krgna’s saving Himself and His associates from
death and of giving deliverance to Aghasura, who had assumed the
form of a python, took place when Krsna was five years old. It was
disclosed in Vrajabhiimi after one year, as if it had taken place on
that very day.
PURPORT
The word moksanam means “liberation.” For the associates of Krsna
and for Krsna Himself, there is no question about liberation; they are
already liberated, being in the spiritual world. In the material world
there are birth, death, old age and disease, but in the spiritual world
there are no such things because everything is eternal. As for the python,
however, by the association of Krsna and His devotees, Aghasura also
achieved the same facility of eternal life. Therefore, as indicated here by
the word atmahi-moksanam, if the python Aghasura could receive


--- Page 302 ---
300 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 10, Ch. 12
eternal association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, what is to
be said of those who are already associates of the Lord? Sakari vijahruh
krta-punya-pufijah (Bhag. 10.12.11). Here is proof that God is good for
everyone. Even when He kills someone, the one who is killed attains
liberation. What then is to be said of those who are already in the
association of the Lord?

TRANSLATION
Krsna is the cause of all causes. The causes and effects of the ma-

terial world, both higher and lower, are all created by the Supreme
Lord, the original controller. When Krsna appeared as the son of
Nanda Maharaja and Yasoda, He did so by His causeless mercy.
Consequently, for Him to exhibit His unlimited opulence was not


--- Page 303 ---
Text 39] The Killing of the Demon Aghisura 301
at all wonderful. Indeed, He showed such great mercy that even
Aghasura, the most sinful miscreant, was elevated to being one of
His associates and achieving sartpya-mukti, which is actually im-
possible for materially contaminated persons to attain.
PURPORT
The word maya is also used in connection with love. Out of maya,
love, a father has affection for his child. Therefore the word mayinah in-
dicates that Krsna, out of love, appeared as the son of Nanda Maharaja
and assumed the form of a human child (manujarbha). Krsna is the
cause of all causes. He is the creator of cause and effect, and He is the
supreme controller. Nothing is impossible for Him. Therefore, that He
enabled even a living being like Aghdsura to attain the salvation of
sarapya-mukti was not at all wonderful for Krsna. Krsna took pleasure
in entering the mouth of Aghasura in a sporting spirit along with His
associates. Therefore, when Aghasura, by that sporting association, as
maintained in the spiritual world, was purified of all contamination, he
attained saripya-mukti and vimukti by the grace of Krsna. For Krsna
this was not at all wonderful.

TRANSLATION

If even only once or even by force one brings the form of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead into one’s mind, one can attain
the supreme salvation by the mercy of Krsna, as did Aghasura.
‘What then is to be said of those whose hearts the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead enters when He appears as an incarnation, or
those who always think of the lotus feet of the Lord, who is the
source of transcendental bliss for all living entities and by whom
all illusion is completely removed?

PURPORT

The process for receiving the favor of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead is described here. Yat-pada-parikaja-palasa-vilasa-bhaktya
(Bhag. 4.22.39). Simply by thinking of Krsna, one can attain Him very
easily. Krsna is also described as having His lotus feet always within the
hearts of His devotees (bhagavan bhakta-hrdi sthitah). In the case of
Aghasura, one may argue that he was not a devotee. The answer to this is
that he thought of Krsna for a moment with devotion. Bhaktyaham
ekaya grahyah. Without devotion, one cannot think of Krsna; and, con-
versely, whenever one thinks of Krsna, one undoubtedly has devotion.
Although Aghasura’s purpose was to kill Krsna, for a moment Aghasura
thought of Krsna with devotion, and Krsna and His associates wanted to
sport within Aghasura’s mouth. Similarly, Pitana wanted to kill Krsna
by poisoning Him, but Krsna took her as His mother because He had ac-
cepted the milk of her breast. Svalpam apy asya dharmasya trayate
mahato bhayat (Bg. 2.40). Especially when Krsna appears as an avatdra,
anyone who thinks of Krsna in His different incarnations (ramadi-mir-
tisu kala-niyamena tisthan), and especially in His original form as


--- Page 305 ---
Text 40] The Killing of the Demon Aghasura 303
Krsna, attains salvation. There are many instances of this, and among
them is Aghasura, who attained the salvation of saripya-mukti.
Therefore the process is satatarn kirtayanto mam yatantas ca drdha-
vratah (Bg. 9.14). Those who are devotees always engage in glorifying
Krsna. Advaitam acyutam anadim ananta-ripam: when we speak of
Krsna, we refer to all His avataras, such as Krsna, Govinda, Narayana,
Visnu, Lord Caitanya, Krsna-Balarama and Syamasundara. One who al-
ways thinks of Krsna must attain vimukti, special salvation as the Lord’s
personal associate, not necessarily in Vrndavana, but at least in
Vaikuntha. This is called saripya-mubkti.

TRANSLATION
O my lord, my spiritual master, although we are the lowest of
ksatriyas, we are glorified and benefited because we have the op-
portunity of always hearing from you the nectar of the pious ac-
tivities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
PURPORT
The pious activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are very
confidential. It is not ordinarily possible to hear such activities unless one
is very, very fortunate. Pariksit Maharaja placed himself as ksatra-
bandhavah, which means “the lowest of the ksatriyas.”” The qualities of
the ksatriya are described in Bhagavad-gita, and although the general
quality of the ksatriya is iSvara-bhdva, the tendency to rule, a ksatriya is
not supposed to rule over a brahmana. Thus Maharaja Pariksit regretted
that he had wanted to rule over the brahmanas and had therefore been
cursed. He considered himself the lowest of the ksatriyas. Danam व्यव
bhavas ca ksatram karma svabhavajam (Bg. 18.43). There was no
doubt that Maharaja Pariksit had the good qualities of a ksatriya, but as a
devotee he presented himself, with submissiveness and humility, as the
lowest of the ksatriyas, remembering his act of wrapping a dead serpent
around the neck of a brahmana. A student and disciple has the right to
ask the guru about any confidential service, and it is the duty of the guru
to explain these confidential matters to his disciple.

in the past; prstah—being inquired from; sah—he; tu—indeed;
badarayanih—Sukadeva Gosvami; tat—by him (Sukadeva Gosvimi);

TRANSLATION

Siita Gosvami said: O Saunaka, greatest of saints and devotees,
when Maharaja Pariksit inquired from Sukadeva Gosvami in this
way, Sukadeva Gosvami, immediately remembering subject mat-
ters about Krsna within the core of his heart, externally lost con-
tact with the actions of his senses. Thereafter, with great difficulty,
he revived his external sensory perception and began to speak to
Maharaja Pariksit about krsna-katha.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Tenth Canto, Twelfth
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled, “The Killing of the Demon
Aghasura.”

The Author

His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada appeared in
this world in 1896 in Calcutta, India. He first met his spiritual master,
Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami, in Calcutta in 1922. Bhakti-
siddhanta Sarasvati, a prominent devotional scholar and the founder of
sixty-four Gaudiya Mathas (Vedic institutes), liked this educated young
man and convinced him to dedicate his life to teaching Vedic knowledge.
Srila Prabhupada became his student, and eleven years later (1933) at
Allahabad he became his formally initiated disciple.

At their first meeting, in 1922, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati
Thakura requested Srila Prabhupada to broadcast Vedic knowledge
through the English language. In the years that followed, Srila Prabhu-
pada wrote a commentary on the Bhagavad-gitd, assisted the Gaudiya
Matha in its work and, in 1944, without assistance, started an English
fortnightly magazine, edited it, typed the manuscripts and checked the
galley proofs. He even distributed the individual copies freely and strug-
gled to maintain the publication. Once begun, the magazine never
stopped; it is now being continued by his disciples in the West.

Recognizing Srila Prabhupada’s philosophical learning and devotion,
the Gaudiya Vaisnava Society honored him in 1947 with the title
“Bhaktivedanta.”” In 1950, at the age of fifty-four, Srila Prabhupada
retired from married life, and four years later he adopted the
vanaprastha (retired) order to devote more time to his studies and writ-
ing. Srila Prabhupada traveled to the holy city of Vrndavana, where he
lived in very humble circumstances in the historic medieval temple of
Radha-Damodara. There he engaged for several years in deep study and
writing. He accepted the renounced order of life (sannydsa) in 1959. At
Radha-Damodara, Srila Prabhupada began work on his life’s master-
piece: a multivolume translation and commentary on the eighteen thou-
sand verse Srimad-Bhagavatam (Bhdgavata Purana). He also wrote
Easy Journey to Other Planets. i

After publishing three volumes of Bhagavatam, Srila Prabhupada
came to the United States, in 1965, to fulfill the mission of his spiritual
master. Since that time, His Divine Grace has written over forty volumes
of authoritative translations, commentaries and summary studies of the
philosophical and religious classics of India.

In 1965, when he first arrived by freighter in New York City, Srila
Prabhupada was practically penniless. It was after almost a year of great
difficulty that he established the International Society for Krishna Con-
sciousness in July of 1966. Under his careful guidance, the Society has
grown within a decade to a worldwide confederation of almost one
hundred asramas, schools, temples, institutes and farm communities.

In 1968, Srila Prabhupada created New Vrndavana, an experimental
Vedic community in the hills of West Virginia. Inspired by the success of
New Vrndavana, now a thriving farm community of more than one thou-
sand acres, his students have since founded several similar communities
in the United States and abroad.

In 1972, His Divine Grace introduced the Vedic system of primary and
secondary education in the West by founding the Gurukula school in
Dallas, Texas. The school began with 3 children in 1972, and by the
beginning of 1975 the enrollment had grown to 150.

rila Prabhupada has also inspired the construction of a large inter-
national center at Sridhama Mayépur in West Bengal, India, which is also
the site for a planned Institute of Vedic Studies. A similar project is the
magnificent Krsna-Balarama Temple and International Guest House in
Vrndavana, India. These are centers where Westerners can live to gain
firsthand experience of Vedic culture.

Srila Prabhupada’s most significant contribution, however, is his
books. Highly respected by the academic community for their authori-
tativeness, depth and clarity, they are used as standard textbooks in
numerous college courses. His writings have been translated into eleven
languages. The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, established in 1972 ex-
clusively to publish the works of His Divine Grace, has thus become the
world’s largest publisher of books in the field of Indian religion and phi-
losophy. Its latest project is the publishing of Srila Prabhupada’s most
recent work: a seventeen-volume translation and commentary —com-
pleted by Srila Prabhupada in only eighteen months—on the Bengali
religious classic Sri Caitanya-caritamrta. A

In the past ten years, in spite of his advanced age, Srila Prabhupada
has circled the globe twelve times on lecture tours that have taken him to
six continents. In spite of such a vigorous schedule, Srila Prabhupada
continues to write prolifically. His writings constitute a veritable library
of Vedic philosophy, religion, literature and culture.

g — asin give t — asin tub
gh— asin dig-hard th — asin light-heart

There is no strong accentuation of syllables in Sanskrit, or pausing
between words in a line, only a flowing of short and long (twice as
long as the short) syllables. A long syllable is one whose vowel is
long (a, i, प, e, ai, 0, au), or whose short vowel is followed by more
than one consonant (including anusvara and visarga). Aspirated
consonants (such as kha and gha) count as only single consonants.

“The Srimad-Bhagavatam is widely acclaimed as
the bible of Indian devotionalism par excellence. His
Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhu-

Bhagavatam with English translation and commen-

page. The physical layout of these volumes and the
many beautiful illustrations are pleasing to the eye as
well as to the mind.”

Bhagavatam to numerous Westerners who otherwise
would miss this opportunity.”
