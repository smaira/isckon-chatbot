Preface

We must know the present need of human society. And what is that
need? Human society is no longer bounded by geographical limits to par-
ticular countries or communities. Human society is broader than in the
Middle Ages. and the world tendency is toward one state or one human
society. The ideals of spiritual communism. according to Srimad-
Bhagavatam, are based more or less on the oneness of the entire human
society. nay. on the entire energy of living beings. The need is felt by
great thinkers to make this a successful ideology. Srimad-Bhagavatam
will fill this need in human society. It begins. therefore. with the aphor-
ism of Vedanta philosophy (janmady asya yatah) to establish the ideal of
a common cause.

Human society. at the present moment, is not in the darkness of obli-
vion. It has made rapid progress in the field of material comforts. educa-
tion and economic development throughout the entire world. But there is
a pinprick somewhere in the social body at large. and therefore there are
large-scale quarrels. even over less important issues. There is need of a
clue as to how humanity can become one in peace. friendship and
prosperity with a common cause. Srimad-Bhagavatam will fill this need.
for it is a cultural presentation for the re-spiritualization of the entire
human society.

Srimad-Bhagavatam should be introduced also in the schools and col-
leges. for it is recommended by the great student devotee Prahlada
Maharaja in order to change the demonic face of society.

Disparity in human society is due to lack of principles in a godless
civilization. There is God. or the Almighty One. from whom everything
emanates, by whom everything is maintained and in whom everything is

merged to rest. Material science has tried to find the ultimate source of
creation very insufficiently, but it is a fact that there is one ultimate
source of everything that be. This ultimate source is explained rationally
and authoritatively in the beautiful Bhagavatam or Srimad-
Bhagavatam.

Srimad-Bhagavatam is the transcendental science not only for know-
ing the ultimate source of everything but also for knowing our relation
with Him and our duty towards perfection of the human society on the
basis of this perfect knowledge. It is powerful reading matter in the
Sanskrit language, and it is now rendered into English elaborately so that
simply by a careful reading one will know God perfectly well, so much so
that the reader will be sufficiently educated to defend himself from the
onslaught of atheists. Over and above this, the reader will be able to con-
vert others to accept God as a concrete principle.

Srimad-Bhagavatam begins with the definition of the ultimate source.
It is a bona fide commentary on the Vedanta-sitra by the same author,
Srila Vyasadeva, and gradually it develops into nine cantos up to the
highest state of God realization. The only qualification one needs to study
this great book of transcendental knowledge is to proceed step by step
cautiously and not jump forward haphazardly as with an ordinary
book. It should be gone through chapter by chapter, one after another.
The reading matter is so arranged with its original Sanskrit text, its
English transliteration, synonyms, translation and purports so that one is
sure to become a God realized soul at the end of finishing the first nine
cantos.

The Tenth Canto is distinct from the first nine cantos, because it deals
directly with the transcendental activities of the Personality of Godhead
Sri Krsna. One will be unable to capture the effects of the Tenth Canto
without going through the first nine cantos. The book is complete in
twelve cantos, each independent, but it is good for all to read them in
small installments one after another.

I must admit my frailties in presenting Srimad-Bhagavatam, but still
I am hopeful of its good reception by the thinkers and leaders of society
on the strength of the following statement of Srimad-Bhagavatam.

Introduction

“This Bhagavata Purana is as brilliant as the sun, and it has arisen
just after the departure of Lord Krsna to His own abode. accompanied by
religion, knowledge, etc. Persons who have lost their vision due to the
dense darkness of ignorance in the age of Kali shall get light from this
Purana.” (Srimad-Bhagavatam 1.3.43)

The timeless wisdom of India is expressed in the Vedas, ancient
Sanskrit texts that touch upon all fields of human knowledge. Originally
preserved through oral tradition, the Vedas were first put into writing
five thousand years ago by Srila Vyasadeva, the ‘literary incarnation of
God.” After compiling the Vedas, Vyasadeva set forth their essence in
the aphorisms known as Vedanta-sitras. Srimad-Bhagavatam 15
Vyasadeva’s commentary on his own Vedanta-sitras. It was written in
the maturity of his spiritual life under the direction of Narada Muni, his
spiritual master. Referred to as “‘the ripened fruit of the tree of Vedic
literature.” Srimad-Bhagavatam is the most complete and authoritative
exposition of Vedic knowledge.

After compiling the Bhagavatam, Vyasa impressed the synopsis of it
upon his son, the sage Sukadeva Gosvami. Sukadeva Gosvami subse-
quently recited the entire Bhagavatam to Maharaja Pariksit in an assem-
bly of learned saints on the bank of the Ganges at Hastinapura (now
Delhi). Maharaja Pariksit was the emperor of the world and was a great
rajarsi (saintly king). Having received a warning that he would die
within a week. he renounced his entire kingdom and retired to the bank
of the Ganges to fast until death and receive spiritual enlightenment.
The Bhagavatam begins with Emperor Pariksit’s sober inquiry to
Sukadeva Gosvami:

“You are the spiritual master of great saints and
devotees. I am therefore begging you to show the
way of perfection for all persons, and especially for
one who is about to die. Please let me know what a
man should hear, chant. remember and worship.
and also what he should not do. Please explain all
this to me.”

प

xiv Srimad-Bhagavatam

Sukadeva Gosviami’s answer to this question, and numerous other
questions posed by Maharaja Pariksit, concerning everything from the
nature of the self to the origin of the universe, held the assembled sages
in rapt attention continuously for the seven days leading to the King's
death. The sage Sita Gosvami, who was present on the bank of the
Ganges when Sukadeva Gosvami first recited Srimad-Bhagavatam, later
repeated the Bhagavatam before a gathering of sages in the forest of
Naimisaranya. Those sages, concerned about the spiritual welfare of the
people in general. had gathered to perform a long. continuous chain of
sacrifices to counteract the degrading influence of the incipient age of
Kali. In response to the sages’ request that he speak the essence of Vedic
wisdom, ৩018 Gosvami repeated from memory the entire eighteen thou-
sand verses of Srimad-Bhagavatam, as spoken by Sukadeva Gosvami to
Maharaja Pariksit. ,

The reader of Srimad-Bhagavatam hears Sata Gosvami relate the
questions of Maharaja Pariksit and the answers of Sukadeva Gosvami.
Also, Sata Gosvami sometimes responds directly to questions put by
Saunaka Rsi, the spokesman for the sages gathered at Naimisaranya. One
therefore simultaneously hears two dialogues: one between Maharaja
Pariksit and Sukadeva Gosvami on the bank of the Ganges. and another
at Naimisaranya between Sita Gosvami and the sages at Naimisaranya
Forest, headed by Saunaka Rsi. Furthermore, while instructing King
Pariksit, Sukadeva Gosvami often relates historical episodes and gives
accounts of lengthy philosophical discussions between such great souls as
the saint Maitreya and his disciple Vidura. With this understanding of
the history of the Bhagavatam, the reader will easily be able to follow its
intermingling of dialogues and events from various sources. Since
philosophical wisdom, not chronological order. is most important in the
text, one need only be attentive to the subject matter of Srimad-
Bhagavatam to appreciate fully its profound message.

It should also be noted that the volumes of the Bhdagavatam need not
be read consecutively, starting with the first and proceeding to the last.
The translator of this edition compares the Bhdgavatam to sugar
candy —wherever you taste it. you will find it equally sweet and
relishable.

This edition of the Bhagavatam is the first complete English transla-
tion of this important text with an elaborate commentary. and it is the

first widely available to the English-speaking public. It is the product of
the scholarly and devotional effort of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhakti-
vedanta Swami Prabhupada, the world’s most distinguished teacher of
Indian religious and philosophical thought. His consummate Sanskrit
scholarship and intimate familiarity with Vedic culture and thought as
well as the modern way of life combine to reveal to the West a magnifi-
cent exposition of this important classic.

Readers will find this work of value for many reasons. For those in-
terested in the classical roots of Indian civilization, it serves as a vast
reservoir of detailed information on virtually every one of its aspects.
For students of comparative philosophy and religion, the Bhagavatam
offers a penetrating view into the meaning of India’s profound spiritual
heritage. To sociologists and anthropologists, the Bhagavatam reveals the
practical workings of a peaceful and scientifically organized Vedic
culture, whose institutions were integrated on the basis of a highly
developed spiritual world view. Students of literature will discover the
Bhagavatam to be a masterpiece of majestic poetry. For students of psy-
chology, the text provides important perspectives on the nature of con-
sciousness, human behavior and the philosophical study of identity.
Finally, to those seeking spiritual insight, the Bhagavatam offers simple
and practical guidance for attainment of the highest self-knowledge and
realization of the Absolute Truth. The entire multivolume text, pre-
sented by the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, promises to occupy a significant
place in the intellectual, cultural and spiritual life of modern man for a
long time to come.

CHAPTER SIX
The Progeny of the Daughters of Daksa
As described in this chapter, Prajapati Daksa begot sixty daughters in the
womb of his wife Asikni. These daughters were given in charity to
various persons to increase the population. Since these offspring of Daksa
were women, Nirada Muni did not try to lead them toward the
renounced order of life. Thus the daughters were saved from Narada
Muni. Ten of the daughters were given in marriage to Dharmaraja,
thirteen to Kasyapa Muni, and twenty-seven to the moon-god, Candra. In
this way fifty daughters were distributed, and of the other ten daughters,
four were given to Kasyapa and two each to Bhata, Angira and Kréasva.
One should know that it is because of the union of these sixty daughters
with various exalted personalities that the entire universe was filled with
various kinds of living entities, such as human beings, demigods,
demons, beasts, birds and serpents.

TRANSLATION

Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said: My dear King, thereafter, at the
request of Lord Brahma, Prajapati Daksa, who is known as
Pracetasa, begot sixty daughters in the womb of his wife Asikni.
All the daughters were very affectionate toward their father.

PURPORT

After the incidents concerning the loss of his many sons, Daksa
repented his misunderstanding with Narada Muni. Lord Brahma then
saw Daksa and instructed him to beget children again. This time Daksa
was very cautious to beget female children instead of male children so
that Narada Muni would not disturb them by urging them to accept the
renounced order. Females are not meant for the renounced order of life;
they should be faithful to their good husbands, for if a husband is
competent for liberation, his wife will also achieve liberation with him.
As stated in the $astra, the results of a husband’s pious activities are
shared by his wife. Therefore a woman’s duty is to be very chaste and
faithful to her husband. Then without separate endeavor she will share
in all the profit the husband earns.

VaiSvanara, the son of Danu, had four beautiful daughters,

married Upadanavi, and Kratu married Hayasira. Thereafter, at the
request of Lord Brahma, Prajapati Kasyapa married Puloma and
Kalaka, the other two daughters of VaiSvanara. From the wombs of
these two wives of KaSyapa came sixty thousand sons, headed by
Nivatakavaca, who are known as the Paulomas and the Kalakeyas.
They were physically very strong and expert in fighting, and their
aim was to disturb the sacrifices performed by the great sages. My
dear King, when your grandfather Arjuna went to the heavenly
planets, he alone killed all these demons, and thus King Indra

became extremely affectionate toward him.

CHAPTER SEVEN
Indra Offends
His Spiritual Master, Brhaspati

As related in this chapter, Indra, the King of heaven, committed an
offense at the feet of his spiritual master, Brhaspati. Brhaspati therefore
left the demigods, who then had no priest. However, at the request of the
demigods, Visvarapa, the son of the brahmana Tvasta, became their
priest.

Once upon a time, Indra, the King of the demigods, was sitting with
his wife Sacidevi and being praised by various demigods like the Siddhas,
Caranas and Gandharvas when Brhaspati, the spiritual master of the
demigods, entered the assembly. Indra, being too absorbed in material
opulence, forgot himself and did not respect Brhaspati, who thus became
aware of Indra’s pride in his material opulence and immediately disap-
peared from the assembly to teach him a lesson. Indra became most
repentant, understanding that because of his opulence he had forgotten
to respect his spiritual master. He left the palace to beg pardon from his
spiritual master, but could not find Brhaspati anywhere.

Because of his disrespectful behavior toward his spiritual master, In-
dra lost all his opulence and was conquered by the demons. who defeated
the demigods in a great fight and occupied Indra’s throne. King Indra.
along with the other demigods, later took shelter of Lord Brahma.
Understanding the situation, Lord Brahma chastised the demigods for
their offense to their spiritual master. Following Lord Brahma’s orders.
the demigods accepted Visvariupa, who was a brahmana and the son of
Tvasta, as their priest. Then they performed yajfias under the priesthood
of Viévarupa and were able to conquer the demons.

TRANSLATION

Sukadeva Gosvami said: O King, once upon a time, the King of
heaven, Indra, being extremely proud because of his great opu-
lence of the three worlds, transgressed the law of Vedic etiquette.
Seated on his throne, he was surrounded by the Maruts, Vasus,
Rudras, Adityas, Rbhus, Visvadevas, Sadhyas, ASvini-kumaras,
Siddhas, Caranas and Gandharvas and by great saintly persons.
Also surrounding him were the Vidyadharas, Apsaras, Kinnaras,
Patagas [birds] and Uragas [snakes]. All of them were offering In-
dra their respects and services, and the Apsaras and Gandharvas
were dancing and singing with very sweet musical instruments.
Over Indra’s head was a white umbrella as effulgent as the full
moon. Fanned by yak-tail whisks and served with all the parapher-
nalia of a great king, Indra was sitting with his wife, Sacidevi, who
occupied half the throne, when the great sage Brhaspati appeared
in that assembly. Brhaspati, the best of the sages, was the spiritual
master of Indra and the demigods and was respected by the
demigods and demons alike. Nevertheless, although Indra saw his
spiritual master before him, he did not rise from his own seat or
offer a seat to his spiritual master, nor did Indra offer him a re-
spectful welcome. Indra did nothing to show him respect.

Although I am King of the demigods, who are situated in the

false ego. Under the circumstances, who in this world would accept
such riches at the risk of falling down? Alas! I condemn my wealth
and opulence.

PURPORT

Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu prayed to the Supreme Personality of God-
head, na dhanari na janarih na sundarir kavitari va jagad-isa kamaye:
“O my Lord, I do not aspire for material opulence or wealth, nor do I
want a great number of followers to accept me as their leader, nor do I
want a very beautiful wife to please me.” Mama janmani janmanisvare
bhavatad bhaktir ahaituki tvayi: “I do not even want liberation. All I
want, life after life, is to be a faithful servant of Your Lordship.” Ac-
cording to the laws of nature, when one is extremely opulent one be-
comes degraded, and this is true both individually and collectively. The
demigods are situated in the mode of goodness, but sometimes even one
who is situated in such an exalted position as King Indra, the king of all
the demigods, falls down because of material opulence. We are now ac-
tually seeing this in America. The entire American nation has tried to ad-
vance in material opulence without striving to produce ideal human
beings. The result is that Americans are now regretting the wholesale
criminality of American society and are wondering how America has be-
come so lawless and unmanageable. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam
(7.5.31), na te viduh svartha-gatimn hi vispum: persons who are
unenlightened do not know the aim of life, which is to return home, back
to Godhead. Therefore, both individually and collectively, they try to en-
joy so-called material comforts, and they become addicted to wine and
women. The men produced in such a society are less than fourth class.


--- Page 41 ---
Text 13] Indra Offends Brhaspati 35
They are the unwanted population known as varna-sarnkara, and as
stated in Bhagavad-gita, an increase of varna-sarnkara population cre-
ates a hellish society. This is the society in which Americans now find
themselves.

Fortunately, however, the Hare Krsna movement has come to
America, and many fortunate young men are giving serious attention to
this movement, which is creating ideal men of first-class character, men
who completely refrain from meat-eating, illicit sex, intoxication and
gambling. If the American people are serious about curbing the degraded
criminal life of their nation, they must take to the Krsna consciousness
movement and try to create the kind of human society advised in
Bhagavad-gita (catur-varmyarih maya srstam guna-karma-vibhagasah).
They must divide their society into first-class men, second-class men,
third-class men and fourth-class men. Since they are now creating only
men who are less than fourth class, how can they avoid the dangers of a
criminal society? Long, long ago, Lord Indra regretted his disrespect to
his spiritual master, Brhaspati. Similarly, it is advised that the American
people regret their mistaken advancement in civilization. They should
take advice from the spiritual master, the representative of Krsna. If
they do so, they will be happy. and theirs will be an ideal nation to lead
the entire world.

36 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 6, Ch. 7
TRANSLATION

If a person says, “0116 who is situated on the exalted throne of a
king should not stand up to show respect to another king or a
brahmana,” it is to be understood that he does not know the
superior religious principles.

PURPORT

Srila Viévanatha Cakravarti Thakura says in this regard that when a
president or king is sitting on his throne, he does not need to show
respect to everyone who comes within his assembly, but he must show
respect to superiors like his spiritual master, brahmanas and Vaisnavas.
There are many examples of how he should act. When Lord Krsna was
sitting on His throne and Narada fortunately entered His assembly, even
Lord Krsna immediately stood up with His officers and ministers to offer
respectful obeisances to Narada. Narada knew that Krsna is the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, and Krsna knew that Narada was His devotee,
but although Krsna is the Supreme Lord and Narada is the Lord’s devo-
tee, the Lord observed the religious etiquette. Since Narada was a
brahmacdrt, a brahmana and an exalted devotee, even Krsna, while act-
ing as a king, offered His respectful obeisances unto Narada. Such is the
conduct visible in the Vedic civilization. A civilization in which the
people do not know how the representative of Narada and Krsna should
be respected, how society should be formed and how one should advance
in Krsna consciousness—a society concerned only with manufacturing
new cars and new skyscrapers every year and then breaking them to
pieces and making new ones—may be technologically advanced, but it is
not a human civilization. A human civilization is advanced when its
people follow the catur-varnya system, the system of four orders of life.
There must be ideal, first-class men to act as advisors, second-class men
to act as administrators, third-class men to produce food and protect
cows, and fourth-class men who obey the three higher classes of society.
One who does not follow the standard system of society should be con-
sidered a fifth-class man. A society without Vedic laws and regulations
will not be very helpful to humanity. As stated in this verse, dharma te
na parari viduh: such a society does not know the aim of life and the
highest principle of religion.

Leaders who have fallen into ignorance and who mislead people
by directing them to the path of destruction [as described in the
previous verse] are, in effect, boarding a stone boat, and so too are
those who blindly follow them. A stone boat would be unable to
float and would sink in the water with its passengers. Similarly,
those who mislead people go to hell, and their followers go with
them.
PURPORT
As stated in the Vedic literature (Bhag. 11.20.17):
nr-deham adyar 51810080778 sudurlabharmi
plavari sukalpari guru-karna-dharam
We, the conditioned souls, have fallen in the ocean of nescience, but the
human body fortunately provides us a good opportunity to cross the
ocean because the human body is like a very good boat. When directed by
a spiritual master acting as the captain, the boat can very easily cross the
ocean. Furthermore, the boat is helped across by favorable winds. which
are the instructions of Vedic knowledge. If one does not take advantage


--- Page 44 ---
38 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 6, Ch. 7
of all these facilities to cross the ocean of nescience. he is certainly
committing suicide.

One who boards a boat made of stone is doomed. To be elevated to the
stage of perfection, humanity must first give up false leaders who pre-
sent boats of stone. All of human society is in such a dangerous position
that to be rescued it must abide by the standard instructions of the
Vedas. The cream of these instructions appears in the form of Bhagavad-
88৫. One should not take shelter of any other instructions, for
Bhagavad-gita gives direct instructions on how to fulfill the aim of
human life. Lord Sri Krsna therefore says. sarva-dharman parityajya
mam 61607 Saranam vraja: “Give up all other processes of religion and
simply surrender to Me.” Even if one does not accept Lord Krsna as the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, His instructions are so exalted and
beneficial for humanity that if one follows His instructions one will be
saved. Otherwise one will be cheated by unauthorized meditation and
gymnastic methods of yoga. Thus one will board a boat of stone. which
will sink and drown all its passengers. Unfortunately. although the
American people are extremely eager to get out of materialistic chaos.
they are sometimes found to patronize the makers of stone boats. That
will not help them. They must take the proper boat offered by Krsna in
the form of the Krsna consciousness movement. Then they will be easily
saved. In this regard Srila Viévanatha Cakravarti Thakura comments:
asmamayah plavo yesam te yatha majjantarn plavam anumajjanti
tatheti raja-nity-upadestrsu sva-sabhyesu kopo vyasjitah. If society is
guided by political diplomacy, with one nation maneuvering against
another, it will certainly sink like a stone boat. Political maneuvering
and diplomacy will not save human society. People must take to Krsna
consciousness to understand the aim of life. to understand God. and to
fulfill the human mission.

dvijam—the perfect brahmana; prasidayisye—I shall please;
nisathah— without duplicity; Sirsna—with my head; tat-caranam—his

TRANSLATION

King Indra said: Therefore with great frankness and without
duplicity I shall now bow my head at the lotus feet of Brhaspati,
the spiritual master of the demigods. Because he is in the mode of
goodness, he is fully aware of all knowledge and is the best of the
brahmanas. Now I shall touch his lotus feet and offer my obei-
sances unto him to try to satisfy him.

PURPORT

Coming to his senses, King Indra realized that he was not a very sin-
cere disciple of his spiritual master, Brhaspati. Therefore he decided that
henceforward he would be nisatha, nonduplicitous. Nisathah Sirsna tac-
caranar sprsan: he decided to touch his head to the feet of his spiritual
master. From this example, we should learn this principle enunciated by
Viévanatha Cakravarti Thakura:

yasya prasadad bhagavat-prasado
yasyaprasadan na gatih kuto 07

“By the mercy of the spiritual master one is benedicted by the mercy of
Krsna. Without the grace of the spiritual master, one cannot make any
advancement.” A disciple should never be a hypocrite or be unfaithful to
his spiritual master. In Srimad-Bhdagavatam (11.17.27), the spiritual
master 15 also called ৫০৫72/2. Acaryarih mam vijaniyan: the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead says that one should respect the spiritual master, ac-
cepting him as the Lord Himself. Navamanyeta karhicit: one should not
disrespect the dcarya at any time. Na martya-buddhyasiyeta: one


--- Page 46 ---
40 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 6, Ch. 7
should never think the @carya an ordinary person. Familiarity some-
times breeds contempt. but one should be very careful in one’s dealings
with the ৫০770. Agadha-dhisanar dvijam: the acarya is a perfect
brahmana and has unlimited intelligence in guiding the activities of his
disciple. Therefore Krsna advises in Bhagavad-gita (4.34):
tad viddhi pranipatena
pariprasnena sevayd
upadeksyanti te jianam
JjRaninas tattva-darsinah
“Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire
from him submissively and render service unto him. The self-realized
soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth.” One
should fully surrender unto the spiritual master. and with service
(sevaya) one should approach him for further spiritual enlightenment.

44 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 6, Ch. 7
TRANSLATION

Lord Brahmi said: O best of the demigods, unfortunately, be-
cause of madness resulting from your material opulence, you
failed to receive Brhaspati properly when he came to your assem-
bly. Because he is aware of the Supreme Brahman and fully in con-
trol of his senses, he is the best of the brahmanas. Therefore it is
very astonishing that you have acted impudently toward him.

PURPORT

Lord Brahma recognized the brahminical qualifications of Brhaspati,
who was the spiritual master of the demigods because of his awareness of
the Supreme Brahman. Brhaspati was very much in control of his senses
and mind, and therefore he was a most qualified brahmana. Lord
Brahma chastised the demigods for not properly respecting this
brahmana, who was their guru. Lord Brahma wanted to impress upon
the demigods that one’s guru should not be disrespected under any
circumstances. When Brhaspati entered the assembly of the demigods,
they and their king, Indra, took him for granted. Since he came every
day, they thought, they did not need to show him special respect. As it is
said, familiarity breeds contempt. Being very much displeased, Brhaspati
immediately left Indra’s palace. Thus all the demigods, headed by Indra,
became offenders at the lotus feet of Brhaspati, and Lord Brahma, being
aware of this, condemned their neglect. In a song we sing every day,
Narottama dasa Thakura says, caksu-dana dila yei, janme janme prabhu
sei: the guru gives spiritual insight to the disciple, and therefore the
guru should be considered his master, life after life. Under no circum-
stances should the guru be disrespected, but the demigods, being puffed
up by their material possessions, were disrespectful to their guru.
Therefore Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.17.27) advises, dcaryam mam vi-
janiyan navamanyeta karhicit/ na martya-buddhyasiyeta: the acarya
should always be offered respectful obeisances; one should never envy
the acarya, considering him an ordinary human being.

TRANSLATION
Because of your misbehavior toward Brhaspati, you have been
defeated by the demons. My dear demigods, since the demons were
weak, having been defeated by you several times, how else could
you, who were so advanced in opulence, be defeated by them?
PURPORT
The devas are celebrated for fighting with the asuras perpetually. In
such fights the asuras were always defeated, but this time the demigods
were defeated. Why? The reason, as stated here, was that they had
offended their spiritual master. Their impudent disrespect of their
spiritual master was the cause of their defeat by the demons. As stated in
the sastras, when one disrespects a respectable superior, one loses his
longevity and the results of his pious activities, and in this way one is
degraded.

TRANSLATION

O Indra, your enemies, the demons, were extremely weak be-
cause of their disrespect toward Sukracarya, but since they have
now worshiped Sukracarya with great devotion, they have again
become powerful. By their devotion to Sukracirya, they have in-
creased their strength so much that now they are even able to
easily seize my abode from me.

PURPORT

Lord Brahma wanted to point out to the demigods that by the strength
of the guru one can become most powerful within this world, and by the
displeasure of the guru one can lose everything. This is confirmed by the
song of Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura:

yasya prasadad bhagavat-prasado
yasyaprasadan na gatih kuto pi

“By the mercy of the spiritual master one is benedicted by the mercy of
Krsna. Without the grace of the spiritual master, one cannot make any
advancement.” Although the demons are insignificant in comparison to
Lord Brahma, because of the strength of their guru they were so power-
ful that they could even seize Brahmaloka from Lord Brahma. We
therefore pray to the spiritual master:

48 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 6, Ch. 7
in the mercy of brahmanas, cows and the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Krsna, and who always worship these three are always
strong in their position.
PURPORT
From the instructions of Lord Brahma it is understood that everyone
should very faithfully worship the brahmanas, the Supreme Personality
of Godhead and the cows. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is go-
brahmana-hitaya ca: He is always very kind to cows and brahmanas.
Therefore one who worships Govinda must satisfy Him by worshiping
the brahmanas and cows. If a government worships the brahmanas, the
cows and Krsna, Govinda, it is never defeated anywhere; otherwise it
must always be defeated and condemned everywhere. At the present
moment, all over the world, governments have no respect for
brahmanas, cows and Govinda, and consequently there are chaotic condi-
tions all over the world. In summary, although the demigods were very
powerful in material opulence, the demons defeated them in battle be-
cause the demigods had behaved disrespectfully toward a brahmana,
Brhaspati, who was their spiritual master.

spiritual master although he was always inclined toward the benefit of
the asuras.

TRANSLATION

The acarya, the spiritual master who teaches all the Vedic knowl-
edge and gives initiation by offering the sacred thread, is the per-
sonification of all the Vedas. Similarly, a father personifies Lord
Brahmas; a brother, King Indra; a mother, the planet earth; and a
sister, mercy. A guest personifies religious principles, an invited
guest personifies the demigod Agni, and all living entities per-
sonify Lord Visnu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

PURPORT

According to the moral instructions of Canakya Pandita, atmavat
sarva-bhiitesu: one should observe all living entities to be on the same
level as oneself. This means that no one should be neglected as inferior;
because Paramatma is seated in everyone's body, everyone should be re-
spected as a temple of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This verse
describes the different ways in which one should respect a guru, a father,
a brother, a sister, a guest and so on.

TRANSLATION

The demigods continued: Do not fear criticism for being
younger than us. Such etiquette does not apply in regard to Vedic
mantras. Except in relationship to Vedic mantras, seniority is
determined by age, but one may offer respectful obeisances even
to a younger person who is advanced in chanting Vedic mantras.
Therefore although you are junior in relationship to us, you may
become our priest without hesitation.

PURPORT

It is said, vrddhatvarm vayasa vind: one may be senior without being
advanced in age. Even if one is not old, one gains seniority if he is senior
in knowledge. Visvariipa was junior in relationship to the demigods be-
cause he was their nephew, but the demigods wanted to accept him as
their priest, and therefore he would have to accept obeisances from
them. The demigods explained that this should not be a cause for hesita-
tion: he could become their priest because he was advanced in Vedic
knowledge. Similarly. Canakya Pandita advises, nicad apy uttamam
JjAdanam: one may accept education from a member of a lower social
order. The brahmanas, the members of the most elevated varna, are
teachers. but a person in a lower family, such as a family of ksatriyas,
vaiSyas or even Sudras, may be accepted as a teacher if he has knowledge.
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu approved of this when He expressed this opin-
ion before Ramananda Raya (Cc. Madhya 8.128):

kiba vipra, kiba nyasi, sudra kene naya
yei krsna-tattva-vetta, sei ‘guru’ haya


--- Page 61 ---
Text 35] Indra Offends Brhaspati 55
It does not matter whether one is a brahmana, 88070, grhastha or san-
nydasi. These are all material designations. A spiritually advanced person
has nothing to do with such designations. Therefore, if one is advanced
in the science of Krsna consciousness, regardless of his position in
human society, he may become a spiritual master.

Sri Visvaripa said: O demigods, although the acceptance of
priesthood is decried as causing the loss of previously acquired
brahminical power, how can someone like me refuse to accept
your personal request? You are all exalted commanders of the en-
tire universe. I am your disciple and must take many lessons from
you. Therefore I cannot refuse you. I must agree for my own
benefit.
PURPORT
The professions of a qualified brahmana are pathana, pathana, ya-
Jana, yajana, dana and pratigraha. The words yajana and ydjana mean
that a brahmana becomes the priest of the populace for the sake of their
elevation. One who accepts the post of spiritual master neutralizes the
sinful reactions of the yajamana, the one on whose behalf he performs
৩0770. Thus the results of the pious acts previously performed by the
priest or spiritual master are diminished. Therefore priesthood is not ac-
cepted by learned brahmanas. Nevertheless, the greatly learned
brahmana Visvarapa became the priest of the demigods because of his
profound respect for them.

O exalted governors of various planets, the true brahmana, who
has no material possessions, maintains himself by the profession of
accepting Silofichana. In other words, he picks up grains left in the
field and on the ground in the wholesale marketplace. By this
means, householder brahmanas who actually abide by the prin-
ciples of austerity and penance maintain themselves and their
families and perform all necessary pious activities. A brahmana
who desires to achieve happiness by gaining wealth through
professional priesthood must certainly have a very low mind. How
shall I accept such priesthood?


--- Page 64 ---
58 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 6, Ch. 7
PURPORT
A first-class brahmana does not accept any rewards from his disciples
or yajamanas. Practicing austerities and penances, he instead goes to the
agricultural field and collects food grains left by the agriculturalists to be
collected by brahmanas. Similarly, such brahmanas go to marketplaces
where grains are purchased and sold wholesale, and there they collect
grains left by the merchants. In this way, such exalted brahmanas main-
tain their bodies and families. Such priests never demand anything from
their disciples to live in opulence, imitating ksatriyas or vaiSyas. In other
words, a pure brahmana voluntarily accepts a life of poverty and lives in
complete dependence on the mercy of the Lord. Not very many years ago,
a brahmana in Krsnanagara, near Navadvipa, was offered some help
from the local Zamindar, Vraja Krsnacandra. The brahmana refused to
accept the help. He said that since he was very happy in his householder
life, taking rice given by his disciples and cooking vegetables of tamarind
leaves, there was no question of taking help from the Zamindar. The
conclusion is that although a brahmana may receive much opulence
from his disciples, he should not utilize the rewards of his priesthood for
his personal benefit; he must use them for the service of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION
Sri Sukadeva Gosvami continued: O King, after making this
promise to the demigods, the exalted Visvariipa, surrounded by
the demigods, performed the necessary priestly activities with
great enthusiasm and attention.
PURPORT
The word samadhina is very important. Samadhi means complete ab-
sorption with an undiverted mind. Viévaripa, who was a most learned
brahmana, not only accepted the request of the demigods. but took their
request seriously and performed the activities of priesthood with an un-
diverted mind. In other words, he accepted the priesthood not for ma-

terial gain, but to profit the demigods. Such is the duty of a priest. The
word purah means “family,” and hita means “‘benefit.”” Thus the word
purohita indicates that the priest is the well-wisher of the family.
Another meaning of the word purah is “first.” A priest’s first duty is to
see that his disciples benefit spiritually and materially by all means. Then
he is satisfied. A priest should never be interested in performing Vedic
rituals for his personal benefit.

TRANSLATION
The opulence of the demons, who are generally known as the
enemies of the demigods, was protected by the talents and tactics
of Sukracarya, but Visvariipa, who was most powerful, composed a
protective prayer known as the Narayana-kavaca. By this intelli-
gent mantra, he took away the opulence of the demons and gave it
to Mahendra, the King of heaven.
PURPORT
The distinction between the demigods (devas) and demons (asuras) is
that the demigods are all devotees of Lord Visnu whereas the demons are
devotees of demigods like Lord Siva, Goddess Kali and Goddess Durga.
Sometimes the demons are also devotees of Lord Brahma. For example,
Hiranyakasipu was a devotee of Lord Brahma, Ravana was a devotee of


--- Page 67 ---
Text 40] Indra Offends Brhaspati 61
Lord Siva, and Mahisasura was a devotee of Goddess Durga. The
demigods are devotees of Lord Visnu (vispu-bhaktah smrto daiva).
whereas the demons (asuras tad-viparyayah) are always against the
visnu-bhaktas, or Vaispavas. To oppose the Vaisnavas, the demons be-
come devotees of Lord Siva, Lord Brahma, Kali, Durga, and so on. In the
days of yore, many long years ago, there was animosity between the
devas and the asuras, and the same spirit still continues, for the devotees
of Lord Siva and Goddess Durga are always envious of Vaisnavas, who
are devotees of Lord Visnu. This strain between the devotees of Lord
Siva and Lord Visnu has always existed. In the higher planetary systems,
fights between the demons and the demigods continue for a long, long
time.

Herein we see that Visvariapa made for the demigods a protective
covering, saturated with a Visnu mantra. Sometimes the Visnu mantra is
called Visnu-jvara, and the Siva mantra is called Siva-jvara. We find in
the $astras that sometimes the Siva-jvara and Visnu-jvara are employed
in the fights between the demons and the demigods.

The word sura-dvisam, which in this verse means “01 the enemies of
the demigods,” also refers to the atheists. Srimad-Bhagavatam
elsewhere says that Lord Buddha appeared for the purpose of bewilder-
ing the demons or atheists. The Supreme Personality of Godhead always
awards His benediction to devotees. The Lord Himself confirms this in
Bhagavad-gita (9.31):

kaunteya pratijanihi
na me bhaktah pranasyati
““O son of Kunti, declare it boldly that My devotee never perishes.”

Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled ‘Indra Offends His
Spiritual Master, Brhaspati.”

CHAPTER EIGHT
The Narayana-kavaca Shield
This chapter describes how Indra, the King of heaven, was victorious
over the soldiers of the demons, and it also describes the shield of the
Visnu mantra.

To take protection from this shield, one must first touch kusa grass
and wash one’s mouth with d@camana-mantras. One should observe
silence and then place the eight-syllable Visnu mantra on the parts of his
body and place the twelve-syllable mantra on his hands. The eight-
syllable mantra is orh namo narayandya. This mantra should be dis-
tributed all over the front and back of the body. The twelve-syllable
mantra, which begins with the pranava, orikara, 15 orh namo bhagavate
vasudevaya. One syllable should be placed on each of the fingers and
should be preceded by the pranava, ornkara. Thereafter, one must chant
oh visnave namah, which is a six-syllable mantra. One must
progressively place the syllables of the mantra on the heart, the head, be-
tween the two eyebrows, on the $ikha and between the eyes, and then one
should chant mah astraya phat and with this mantra protect himself
from all directions. Nadevo devam arcayet: one who has not risen to the
level of a deva cannot chant this mantra. According to this direction of
the $astra, one must think himself qualitatively nondifferent from the
Supreme.

After finishing this dedication, one must offer a prayer to the eight-
armed Lord Visnu, who sits on the shoulders of Garudadeva. One also
has to think of the fish incarnation, Vamana, Karma, Nrsirhha, Varaha,
Parasurama, Ramacandra (the elder brother of Laksmana).
Nara-Narayana, Dattatreya (an empowered incarnation), Kapila,
Sanat-kumara, Hayagriva, Naradadeva (the incarnation of a devotee).
Dhanvantari, Rsabhadeva, ४३] ३, Balarama, Vyasadeva, Buddhadeva
and Kesava. One should also think of Govinda, the master of Vrndavana.
and one should think of Narayana, the master of the spiritual sky. One
should think of Madhusiidana, Tridhama, Madhava, Hrsikesa, Pad-
manabha, Janardana, Damodara and Visvesvara, as well as the Supreme

63

Personality of Godhead Krsna Himself. After offering prayers to the
Lord’s personal expansions known as the svamsa and Saktyavesa-
avatdras, one should pray to the weapons of Lord Narayana, such as the
Sudarsana, gada, Sarikha, khadga and bow.

After explaining this process, Sukadeva Gosvami told Maharaja
Pariksit how Visvaripa, the brother of Vrtrasura, described the glories
of the Narayana-kavaca to Indra.

gravely and silently, facing north. When completely purified, one
should touch the mantra composed of eight syllables to the eight
parts of his body and touch the mantra composed of twelve sylla-
bles to his hands. Thus, in the following manner, he should bind
himself with the Narayana coat of armor. First, while chanting the
mantra composed of eight syllables [orh namo narayanaya), begin-
ning with the pranava, the syllable orn, one should touch his hands
to eight parts of his body, starting with the two feet and progress-
ing systematically to the knees, thighs, abdomen, heart, chest,
mouth and head. Then one should chant the mantra in reverse,
beginning from the last syllable [ya], while touching the parts of
his body in the reverse order. These two processes are known as
utpatti-nyasa and sarmhara-nyasa respectively.

then place the syllable ‘““na’’ on all the joints of his body and medi-

come the perfect personification of the mantra. Thereafter, adding

Supreme Personality of Godhead protect me at all times with His
eight arms. He is all-powerful because He fully possesses the eight
mystic powers [anima, laghima, etc.].
PURPORT

Thinking oneself one with the Supreme is called ahangrahopasana.
Through aharigrahopasana one does not become God, but he thinks of
himself as qualitatively one with the Supreme. Understanding that as a
spirit soul he is equal in quality to the supreme soul the way the water of
a river is of the same nature as the water of the sea, one should meditate
upon the Supreme Lord, as described in this verse, and seek His protec-
tion. The living entities are always subordinate to the Supreme. Conse-
quently their duty is to always seek the mercy of the Lord in order to be
protected by Him in all circumstances.

sanat-kumarah—the great brahmacari named Sanat-kumara:
avatu—may he protect; kdma-devat—from the hands of Cupid or lusty
desire; haya-$irsa—Lord Hayagriva, the incarnation of the Lord whose
head is like that of a horse; mam—me; pathi—on the path: deva-
helanat—from neglecting to offer respectful obeisances to brahmanas,
Vaisnavas and the Supreme Lord; devarsi-varyah—the best of the
saintly sages, Narada; purusa-arcana-antarat—from the offenses in
worshiping the Deity; kdrmah—Lord Karma, the tortoise; harih—the
Supreme Personality of Godhead; mam—me; nirayat—from hell:
asesat—unlimited.

TRANSLATION

May Sanat-kumara protect me from lusty desires. As I begin
some auspicious activity, may Lord Hayagriva protect me from
being an offender by neglecting to offer respectful obeisances to
the Supreme Lord. May Devarsi Narada protect me from commit-
ting offenses in worshiping the Deity, and may Lord Kiirma, the
tortoise, protect me from falling to the unlimited hellish planets.

PURPORT

Lusty desires are very strong in everyone, and they are the greatest
impediment to the discharge of devotional service. Therefore those who
are very much influenced by lusty desires are advised to take shelter of
Sanat-kumara, the great brahmacari devotee. Narada Muni, who is the
guide for arcana, is the author of the Narada-paficaratra, which
prescribes the regulative principles for worshiping the Deity. Everyone
engaged in Deity worship, whether at home or in the temple, should al-
ways seek the mercy of Devarsi Narada in order to avoid the thirty-two
offenses while worshiping the Deity. These offenses in Deity worship are
mentioned in The Nectar of Devotion.

from physical illness. May Lord Rsabhadeva, who conquered His

duality of heat and cold. May Yajfia protect me from defamation
and harm from the populace, and may Lord Balarama as Sesa pro-
tect me from envious serpents.

PURPORT

To live within this material world, one must face many dangers, as de-
scribed herein. For example, undesirable food poses a danger to health,
and therefore one must give up such food. The Dhanvantari incarnation

can protect us in this regard. Since Lord Visnu is the Supersoul of all liv-
ing entities, if He likes He can save us from adhibhautika disturbances,
disturbances from other living entities. Lord Balarama is the Sesa incar-
nation, and therefore He can save us from angry serpents or envious per-
sons, who are always ready to attack.

ritualistic action. May Kalkideva, the Supreme Personality of God-
head, who appeared as an incarnation to protect religious prin-
ciples, protect me from the dirt of the age of Kali.


--- Page 84 ---
78 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 6, Ch. 8
PURPORT

This verse mentions various incarnations of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead who appear for various purposes. Srila Vyasadeva,
Mahamuni, compiled the Vedic literature for the benefit of all human
society. If one wants to be protected from the reactions of ignorance even
in this age of Kali, one may consult the books left by Srila Vyasadeva,
namely the four Vedas (Sama, Yajur, Rg and Atharva), the 108
Upanisads, Vedanta-sitra (Brahma-sitra), Mahabharata, Srimad-
Bhagavatam Maha-purana (Vyasadeva’s commentary on the Brahma-
satra) and the other seventeen Puranas. Only by the mercy of Srila
Vyasadeva do we have so many volumes of transcendental knowledge to
save us from the clutches of ignorance.

As described by Srila Jayadeva Gosvami in his Dasavatara-stotra, Lord
Buddha apparently decried the Vedic knowledge:

nindasi yajiia-vidher ahaha Sruti-jatar

sadaya-hrdaya-darsita-pasu-ghatam

kesava dhrta-buddha-sarira jaya jagad-isa hare
The mission of Lord Buddha was to save people from the abominable ac-
tivity of animal killing and to save the poor animals from being unneces-
sarily killed. When pasandis were cheating by killing animals on the plea
of sacrificing them in Vedic yajnas, the Lord said, “If the Vedic injunc-
tions allow animal killing, I do not accept the Vedic principles.” Thus he
actually saved people who acted according to Vedic principles. One
should therefore surrender to Lord Buddha so that he can help one avoid
misusing the injunctions of the Vedas.

The Kalki avatdra is the fierce incarnation who vanquishes the class of
the atheists born in this age of Kali. Now, in the beginning of Kali-yuga,
many irreligious principles are in effect, and as Kali-yuga advances,
many pseudo religious principles will certainly be introduced, and people
will forget the real religious principles enunciated by Lord Krsna before
the beginning of Kali-yuga, namely principles of surrender unto the
lotus feet of the Lord. Unfortunately, because of Kali-yuga, foolish
people do not surrender to the lotus feet of Krsna. Even most people who
claim to belong to the Vedic system of religion are actually opposed to the
Vedic principles. Every day they manufacture a new type of dharma on


--- Page 85 ---
Text 20] The Narayana-kavaca Shield 79
the plea that whatever one manufactures is also a path of liberation.
Atheistic men generally say, yata mata tata patha. According to this
view, there are hundreds and thousands of different opinions in human
society, and each opinion is a valid religious principle. This philosophy of
rascals has killed the religious principles mentioned in the Vedas, and
such philosophies will become increasingly influential as Kali-yuga
progresses. In the last stage of Kali-yuga, Kalkideva, the fierce incarna-
tion of Kesava, will descend to kill all the atheists and will save only the
devotees of the Lord.

According to Vedic astronomical calculations, day and night are each
divided into thirty ghatikas (twenty-four minutes), instead of twelve
hours. Generally, each day and each night is divided into six parts con-
sisting of five ghatikds. In each of these six portions of the day and night,
the Lord may be addressed for protection according to different names.
Lord Kesava, the proprietor of the holy place of Mathura, is the Lord of
the first portion of the day, and Govinda, the Lord of Vrndavana. is the
master of the second portion.

Therefore the Lord is called advaya-jiiana, indicating that there is no

on. Anything pertaining to Him is in the same category of spiritual exis-
tence. They are all engaged in the service of the Lord in varieties of
spiritual forms.

TRANSLATION

The Supreme Personality of Godhead, the living entities, the
material energy, the spiritual energy and the entire creation are all
individual substances. In the ultimate analysis, however, together
they constitute the supreme one, the Personality of Godhead.
Therefore those who are advanced in spiritual knowledge see
unity in diversity. For such advanced persons, the Lord’s bodily
decorations, His name, His fame, His attributes and forms and the
weapons in His hand are manifestations of the strength of His
potency. According to their elevated spiritual understanding, the
omniscient Lord, who manifests various forms, is present every-
where. May He always protect us everywhere from all calamities.

PURPORT

A person highly elevated in spiritual knowledge knows that nothing
exists but the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is also confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita (9.4) where Lord Krsna says, maya tatam ida sarvam,
indicating that everything we see is an expansion of His energy. This is
confirmed in the Visnu Purana (1.22.52):

ekadesa-sthitasyagner
Jrotsna vistarini yatha
parasya brahmanah saktis
tathedam akhilarh jagat

As a fire, although existing in one place, can expand its light and heat
everywhere, so the omnipotent Lord, the Supreme Personality of God-
head, although situated in His spiritual abode, expands Himself every-
where, in both the material and spiritual worlds, by His various energies.


--- Page 96 ---
90 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 6, Ch. 8
Since both cause and effect are the Supreme Lord, there is no difference
between cause and effect. Consequently the ornaments and weapons of
the Lord, being expansions of His spiritual energy, are not different
from Him. There is no difference between the Lord and His variously
presented energies. This is also confirmed in the Padma Purana:
nama cintamanih krsnas
caitanya-rasa-vigrahah
pirnah suddho nitya-mukto
’bhinnatvan nama-naminoh
The holy name of the Lord is fully identical with the Lord, not partially.
The word pitrna means ‘‘complete.” The Lord is omnipotent and
omniscient, and similarly, His name, form, qualities, paraphernalia and
everything pertaining to Him are complete, pure, eternal and free from
material contamination. The prayer to the ornaments and carriers of the
Lord is not false, for they are as good as the Lord. Since the Lord is all-
pervasive, He exists in everything, and everything exists in Him.
Therefore even worship of the Lord’s weapons or ornaments has the
same potency as worship of the Lord. Mayavadis refuse to accept the
form of the Lord, or they say that the form of the Lord is maya, or false,
but one should note very carefully that this is not acceptable. Although
the Lord’s original form and His impersonal expansion are one, the Lord
maintains His form, qualities and abode eternally. Therefore this prayer
says, pdtu sarvaih svaripair nah sada sarvatra sarva-gah: “May the
Lord, who is all-pervasive in His various forms, protect us everywhere.”
The Lord is always present everywhere by His name, form, qualities, at-
tributes and paraphernalia, and they all have equal power to protect the
devotees. Srila Madhvacirya explains this as follows:
eka eva paro visnur
bhiasaheti dhvajesv ajah
tat-tac-chakti-pradatvena
svayam eva vyavasthitah
satyenanena marin devah
patu sarvesvaro harih

This mystical mantric armor given by Viévaripa to Indra, the King of
heaven, acted powerfully, with the effect that Indra was able to conquer
the asuras and enjoy the opulence of the three worlds without impedi-
ments. In this regard, Madhvacarya points out:

One must receive all kinds of mantras from a bona fide spiritual master;
otherwise the mantras will not be fruitful. This is also indicated in
Bhagavad-gita (4.34):
tad viddhi pranipatena
pariprasnena sevaya
upadeksyanti te jiianarm
JjAdninas tattva-darsinah

“Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire
from him submissively and render service unto him. The self-realized
soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth.” All
mantras should be received through the authorized guru, and the disci-
ple must satisfy the guru in all respects, after surrendering at his lotus
feet. In the Padma Purana it is also said, sampradaya-vihind ye mantras
te nisphala matah. There are four sampradayas, or disciplic successions,
namely the Brahma-sampradiya, the Rudra-sampradaya, the Sri-
sampradiaya and the Kumara-sampradaya. If one wants to advance in
spiritual power, one must receive his mantras from one of these bona
fide sampradayas; otherwise he will never successfully advance in
spiritual life.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Sixth Canto, Eighth
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “The Narayana-kavaca
Shield.”

CHAPTER NINE
Appearance of the Demon Vrtrasura
As described in this chapter, Indra, the King of heaven, killed
Viévariipa, and therefore Visvariipa’s father performed a yajiia to kill
Indra. When Vrtrasura appeared from that व्रत, the demigods, in fear,
sought shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and glorified Him.

Because of affection for the demons, Visvariipa secretly supplied them
the remnants of yajia. When Indra learned about this, he beheaded
Visvaripa, but he later regretted killing Visvaripa because ViSvaripa
was a brahmana. Although competent to neutralize the sinful reactions
for killing a brahmana, Indra did not do so. Instead he accepted the reac-
tions. Later, he distributed these reactions among the land, water, trees
and women in general. Since the land accepted one fourth of the sinful
reactions, a portion of the land turned into desert. The trees were also
given one fourth of the sinful reactions, and therefore they drip sap,
which is prohibited for drinking. Because women accepted one fourth of
the sinful reactions, they are untouchable during their menstrual period.
Since water was also infested with sinful reactions, when bubbles appear
in water it cannot be used for any purpose.

After Visvariipa was killed, his father, Tvasta, performed a sacrifice to
kill King Indra. Unfortunately, if mantras are chanted irregularly, they
yield an opposite result. This happened when Tvasta performed this
yajiia. While performing the sacrifice to kill Indra, Tvasta chanted a
mantra to increase Indra’s enemies, but because he chanted the mantra
wrong, the sacrifice produced an asura named Vrtrasura, of whom Indra
was the enemy. When Vrtrasura was generated from the sacrifice, his
fierce features made the whole world afraid, and his personal effulgence
diminished even the power of the demigods. Finding no other means of
protection, the demigods began to worship the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, the enjoyer of all the results of sacrifice, who is supreme
throughout the entire universe. The demigods all worshiped Him be-
cause ultimately no one but Him can protect a living entity from fear and
danger. Seeking shelter of a demigod instead of worshiping the Supreme

Personality of Godhead is compared to trying to cross the ocean by grasp-
ing the tail of a dog. A dog can swim, but that does not mean that one can
cross the ocean by grasping a dog’s tail.

Being pleased with the demigods, the Supreme Personality of Godhead
advised them to approach Dadhici to beg him for the bones of his own
body. Dadhici would comply with the request of the demigods, and with
the help of his bones Vrtrasura could be killed.

TRANSLATION

Sri Sukadeva Gosvami continued: Visvarupa, who was en-
gaged as the priest of the demigods, had three heads. He used one
to drink the beverage soma-rasa, another to drink wine and the
third to eat food. O King Pariksit, thus I have heard from
authorities.

PURPORT

One cannot directly perceive the kingdom of heaven, its king and
other inhabitants, or how they perform their various engagements, for
no one can go to the heavenly planets. Although modern scientists have

Text 3] The Appearance of the Demon Vrtrasura 101
invented many powerful space vehicles, they cannot even go to the
moon, not to speak of other planets. By direct experience one cannot
learn anything beyond the range of human perception. One must hear
from authorities. Therefore Sukadeva Gosvami, a great personality, says,
“What I am describing to you, 0 King, is what I have heard from au-
thoritative sources.” This is the Vedic system. The Vedic knowledge is
called sruti because it must be received by being heard from authorities.
It is beyond the realm of our false experimental knowledge.

O Maharaja Pariksit, the demigods were related to Vi§varipa
from his father’s side, and therefore he visibly offered clarified
butter in the fire while chanting mantras such as ‘‘indraya idari
svaha’’ [*“this is meant for King Indra’’] and “‘idam agnaye’’ [“‘this
is for the demigod of fire”’]. He loudly chanted these mantras and
offered each of the demigods his proper share.

TRANSLATION
Although offering clarified butter in the sacrificial fire in the
name of the demigods, without the knowledge of the demigods he
also offered oblations to the demons because they were his
relatives through his mother.
PURPORT
Because of Visvarapa'’s affection for the families of both the demigods
and the demons, he appeased the Supreme Lord on behalf of both
dynasties. When he offered oblations in the fire on behalf of the asuras,
he did so secretly, without the knowledge of the demigods.

Once upon a time, however, the King of heaven, Indra, under-
stood that Vi§varupa was secretly cheating the demigods by offer-
ing oblations on behalf of the demons. He became extremely
afraid of being defeated by the demons, and in great anger at
Viévarupa he cut Visvaripa’s three heads from his shoulders.

[sparrow], and the head meant for eating food became a tittiri
[common partridge].

In return for King Indra’s benediction that ditches in the earth
would be filled automatically, the land accepted one fourth of the
sinful reactions for killing a brahmana. Because of those sinful
reactions, we find many deserts on the surface of the earth.
PURPORT
Because deserts are manifestations of the earth’s diseased condition,
no auspicious ritualistic ceremony can be performed in a desert. Persons
destined to live in deserts are understood to be sharing the reactions for
the sin of brahma-hatya, the killing of a brahmana.

TRANSLATION
In return for Lord Indra’s benediction that they would be able
to enjoy lusty desires continuously, even during pregnancy for as
long as sex is not injurious to the embryo, women accepted one
fourth of the sinful reactions. As a result of those reactions,
women manifest the signs of menstruation every month.
PURPORT
Women as a class are very lusty, and apparently their continuous lusty
desires are never satisfied. In return for Lord Indra’s benediction that
there would be no cessation to their lusty desires, women accepted one
fourth of the sinful reactions for killing a brahmana.

And in return for King Indra’s benediction that water would in-
crease the volume of other substances with which it was mixed,
water accepted one fourth of the sinful reactions. Therefore there
are bubbles and foam in water. When one collects water, these
should be avoided.
PURPORT
If water is mixed with milk, fruit juice or other similar substances. it
increases their volume, and no one can understand which has increased.
In return for this benediction, water accepted one fourth of Indra’s sin-
ful reactions. These sinful reactions are visible in foam and bubbles.
Therefore one should avoid foam and bubbles while collecting drinking
water.

sacrificial fire, saying, ““O enemy of Indra, flourish to kill your
enemy without delay.”

PURPORT

There was some defect in Tvasta’s chanting of the mantra because he
chanted it long instead of short, and therefore the meaning changed.
Tvasta intended to chant the word indra-satro, meaning, "0 enemy of
Indra.” In this mantra, the word indra is in the possessive case (sasthi),
and the word indra-satro is called a tat-purusa compound (tatpurusa-
samadsa). Unfortunately, instead of chanting the mantra short, Tvasta
chanted it long, and its meaning changed from ‘‘the enemy of Indra” to
“Indra, who is an enemy.” Consequently instead of an enemy of Indra’s,
there emerged the body of Vrtrasura, of whom Indra was the enemy.

time; yatha—just as.

TRANSLATION

Thereafter, from the southern side of the sacrificial fire known
as Anviahiarya came a fearful personality who looked like the
destroyer of the entire creation at the end of the millennium.

TRANSLATION

Like arrows released in the four directions, the demon’s body
grew, day after day. Tall and blackish, he appeared like a burnt hill
and was as lustrous as a bright array of clouds in the evening. The
hair on the demon’s body and his beard and moustache were the
color of melted copper, and his eyes were piercing like the midday
sun. He appeared unconquerable, as if holding the three worlds on
the points of his blazing trident. Dancing and shouting with a loud
voice, he made the entire surface of the earth tremble as if from an
earthquake. As he yawned again and again, he seemed to be trying
to swallow the whole sky with his mouth, which was as deep as a
cave. He seemed to be licking up all the stars in the sky with his
tongue and eating the entire universe with his long, sharp teeth.
Seeing this gigantic demon, everyone, in great fear, ran here and
there in all directions.

In the Vedas it is said, sa imal lokan avrnot tad vrtrasya vrtratvam:

Vrtrasura.

The demigods said: The three worlds are created by the five ele-
ments—namely ether, air, fire, water and earth—which are con-
trolled by various demigods, beginning from Lord Brahma. Being
very much afraid that the time factor will end our existence, we
offer presentations unto time by performing our work as time dic-
tates. The time factor himself, however, is afraid of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Therefore let us now worship that
Supreme Lord, who alone can give us full protection.
PURPORT
When one is afraid of being killed, one must take shelter of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is worshiped by all the demigods.
beginning from Brahma, although they are in charge of the various ele-
ments of this material world. The words bibheti yasmat indicate that all
the demons, regardless of how great and powerful, fear the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. The demigods, being afraid of death, took
shelter of the Lord and offered Him these prayers. Although the time
factor is fearful to everyone, fear personified is afraid of the Supreme
Lord, who is therefore known as abhaya, fearless. Taking shelter of the
Supreme Lord brings actual fearlessness, and therefore the demigods
decided to take shelter of the Lord.

TRANSLATION
Free from all material conceptions of existence and never won-
derstruck by anything, the Lord is always jubilant and fully
satisfied by His own spiritual perfection. He has no material desig-
nations, and therefore He is steady and unattached. That Supreme
Personality of Godhead is the only shelter of everyone. Anyone
desiring to be protected by others is certainly a great fool who
desires to cross the sea by holding the tail of a dog.
PURPORT
A dog can swim in the water, but if a dog dives in the ocean and some-
one wants to cross the ocean by holding the dog’s tail, he is certainly fool
number one. A dog cannot cross the ocean, nor can a person cross the
ocean by catching a dog’s tail. Similarly, one who desires to cross the
ocean of nescience should not seek the shelter of any demigod or anyone
else but the fearless shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.14.58) therefore says:

of that boat he can easily cross the ocean of nescience. Consequently
there are no dangers for a devotee although he lives within this material
world. which is full of dangers at every step. One should seek the shelter
of the all-powerful instead of trying to be protected by one’s own
concocted ideas.

TRANSLATION
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who created us by His ex-
ternal potency and by whose mercy we expand the creation of the
universe, is always situated before us as the Supersoul, but we can-
not see His form. We are unable to see Him because all of us think
that we are separate and independent gods.
PURPORT
Here is an explanation of why the conditioned soul cannot see the
Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face. Even though the Lord ap-
pears before us as Lord Krsna or Lord Ramacandra and lives in human
society as a leader or king, the conditioned soul cannot understand Him.
Avajananti mam midha manusim tanum dsritam: rascals (madhas)
deride the Supreme Personality of Godhead, thinking Him an ordinary
human being. However insignificant we are, we think that we are also
God, that we can create a universe or that we can create another God.
This is why we cannot see or understand the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. In this regard, Srila Madhvacarya says:

By His inconceivable internal potency, the Supreme Personality
of Godhead expands into various transcendental bodies as
Vamanadeva, the incarnation of strength among the demigods;
Para$urama, the incarnation among saints; Nrsirnhadeva and
Varaha, incarnations among animals; and Matsya and Karma, in-
carnations among aquatics. He accepts various transcendental
bodies among all types of living entities, and among human beings
He especially appears as Lord Krsna and Lord Rama. By His cause-
less mercy, He protects the demigods, who are always harassed by
the demons. He is the supreme worshipable Deity of all living en-
tities. He is the supreme cause, represented as the male and female
creative energies. Although different from this universe, He exists
in His universal form [virata-rapa]. In our fearful condition, let us
take shelter of Him, for we are sure that the Supreme Lord, the
Supreme Soul, will give us His protection.
PURPORT
In this verse, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu, is ascer-
tained to be the original cause of creation. Sridhara Svami, in his com-
mentary Bhavartha-dipika, replies to the idea that prakrti and purusa
are the causes of the cosmic manifestation. As stated herein, param
pradhanari [01871850712 visvam anyam: “He is the supreme cause. repre-
sented as the male and female creative energies. Although different from
this universe, He exists in His universal form [virate-rapal.” The word
prakrti, which is used to indicate the source of generation, refers to the
material energy of the Supreme Lord, and the word purusa refers to the


--- Page 125 ---
120 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 6, Ch. 9
living entities, who are the superior energy of the Lord. Both the prakrti
and purusa ultimately enter the Supreme Lord, as stated in Bhagavad-
gita (prakrtirh yanti mamikam).

Although prakrti and purusa superficially appear to be the causes of
the material manifestation, both are emanations of different energies of
the Supreme Lord. Therefore the Supreme Lord is the cause of prakrti
and purusa. He is the original cause (sarva-karana-karanam). The
Naradiya Purana says:

avikaro pi paramah
prakrtis tu vikarini
anupravisya govindah
prakrtis cabhidhiyate
Both the prakrti and purusa, which are inferior and superior energies,
are emanations from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As explained
in Bhagavad-gita (gam avisya), the Lord enters the prakrti, and then the
prakrti creates different manifestations. The prakrti is not independent
or beyond His energies. Vasudeva, Lord Sri Krsna, is the original cause
of everything. Therefore the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (10.8):
ahari sarvasya prabhavo
mattah sarvam pravartate
iti matva bhajante mam
budha bhava-samanvitah
“I am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything
emanates from Me. The wise who perfectly know this engage in My
devotional service and worship Me with all their hearts.” In Srimad-
Bhagavatam (2.9.33) the Lord also says, aham evasam evagre: “Only 1
existed before the creation.” This is confirmed in the Brahmanda
Purana as follows:
smrtir avyavadhanena
prakrtitvam iti sthitih
ubhayatmaka-sititvad
vasudevah parah puman
prakrtih purusas ceti
Sabdair eko ’bhidhiyate


--- Page 126 ---
Text 30] The Appearance of the Demon Vrtrasura 121
To generate the universe, the Lord acts indirectly as the purusa and
directly as the prakrti. Because both energies emanate from Lord
Vasudeva, the all-pervasive Supreme Personality of Godhead, He is
known as both prakrti and purusa. Therefore Vasudeva is the cause of
everything (sarva-karana-karanam).

Surrounding and serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead,

petals of lotuses grown in autumn, they were overwhelmed with
happiness and immediately fell down like rods, offering dandavats.
Then they slowly rose and pleased the Lord by offering Him
prayers.

In Vaikunthaloka the Supreme Personality of Godhead has four hands
and decorations like the Srivatsa mark on His chest and the gem known
as Kaustubha. These are special indications of the Supreme Personality

(the heavenly planets, the earthly planets and hell); &Situh—who are the
controller; paramam padam—the supreme abode, Vaikunthaloka; na—
not: arvdcinah—a person appearing after; visargasya—the creation;

TRANSLATION
O supreme controller, You control the three destinations
[promotion to the heavenly planets, birth as a human being, and
condemnation in hell], yet Your supreme abode is Vaikuntha-
dhama. Since we appeared after You created this cosmic manifesta-
tion, Your activities are impossible for us to understand. We
therefore have nothing to offer You but our humble obeisances.
PURPORT
An inexperienced man generally does not know what to beg from the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Everyone is under the jurisdiction of
the created material world, and no one knows what benediction to ask
when praying to the Supreme Lord. People generally pray to be pro-
moted to the heavenly planets because they have no information of
Vaikunthaloka. Srila Madhvacarya quotes the following verse:
deva-lokat pitr-lokat
niraydc capi yat param
tisrbhyah paramari sthanari
wvaisnavarn vidusarn gatih
There are different planetary systems, known as Devaloka (the planets of
the demigods), Pitrloka (the planet of the Pitas) and Niraya (the hellish
planets). When one transcends these various planetary systems and en-
ters Vaikunthaloka, he achieves the ultimate resort of the Vaisnavas.
Vaisnavas have nothing to do with the other planetary systems.

TRANSLATION

O Supreme Personality of Godhead, O Narayana, O Vasudeva,
original person! 0 most exalted person, supreme experience,
welfare personified! O supreme benediction, supremely merciful
and changeless! O support of the cosmic manifestation, sole
proprietor of all planetary systems, master of everything and hus-
band of the goddess of fortune! Your Lordship is realized by the
topmost sannyasis, who wander about the world to preach Krsna
consciousness, fully absorbed in samadhi through bhakti-yoga.
Because their minds are concentrated upon You, they can receive
the conception of Your personality in their fully purified hearts.
When the darkness in their hearts is completely eradicated and
You are revealed to them, the transcendental bliss they enjoy is the
transcendental form of Your Lordship. No one but such persons
can realize You. Therefore we simply offer You our respectful
obeisances.

PURPORT

The Supreme Personality of Godhead has numerous transcendental
names pertaining to different grades of revelation to various grades of
devotees and transcendentalists. When He is realized in His impersonal
form He is called the Supreme Brahman, when realized as the
Paramatma He is called antaryami, and when He expands Himself in
different forms for material creation He is called Ksirodakasayi Visnu,
Garbhodakasayi Visnu and Karanodakasayi Visnu. When He is realized
as Vasudeva, Sankarsana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha—the Caturvyiha,
who are beyond the three forms of Visnu—He is the Vaikuntha
Narayana. Above realization of Narayana is realization of Baladeva, and
above that is realization of Krsna. All these realizations are possible when
one engages fully in devotional service. The covered core of one’s heart is
then completely open to receiving an understanding of the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead in His various forms.

creation, maintenance and annihilation; yat—which; asaranah—not
dependent on any other support; asarirah—without having a material

TRANSLATION

O Lord, You need no support, and although You have no ma-
terial body, You do not need cooperation from us. Since You are
the cause of the cosmic manifestation and You supply its material
ingredients without being transformed, You create, maintain and
annihilate this cosmic manifestation by Yourself. Nevertheless, al-
though You appear engaged in material activity, You are transcen-
dental to all material qualities. Consequently these transcendental
activities of Yours are extremely difficult to understand.

PURPORT

The Brahma-sarhita (5.37) says, goloka eva nivasaty akhilatma-
bhiitah: the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, is always situated
in Goloka Vrndavana. It is also said, vrndavanari parityajya padam
eka na gacchati: Krsna never goes even a step from Vrndavana.
Nevertheless, although Krsna is situated in His own abode, Goloka
Vrndavana, He is simultaneously all-pervading and is therefore present
everywhere. This is very difficult for a conditioned soul to understand.
but devotees can understand how Krsna, without undergoing any
changes, can simultaneously be in His abode and be all-pervasive. The
demigods are understood to be various limbs of the Supreme Lord's
body, although the Supreme Lord has no material body and does not need


--- Page 133 ---
128 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 6, Ch. 9
anyone's help. He is spread everywhere (maya tatam 10278 sarvar jagad
avyakta-mirting). Nevertheless, He is not present everywhere in His
spiritual form. According to the Mayavada philosophy, the Supreme
Truth. being all-pervasive, does not need a transcendental form. The
Mayavadis suppose that since His form is distributed everywhere, He has
no form. This is untrue. The Lord keeps His transcendental form. and at
the same time He extends everywhere, in every nook and corner of the
material creation.

These are our inquiries. The ordinary conditioned soul is sub-

tions. Does Your Lordship, like an ordinary human being, exist


--- Page 134 ---
Text 36] The Appearance of the Demon Vrtrasura 129
within this material world in a body produced by the material
modes? Do You enjoy or suffer the good or bad results of actions
under the influence of time, past work and so forth? Or, on the
contrary, are You present here only as a neutral witness who is
self-sufficient, free from all material desires, and always full of
spiritual potency? We certainly cannot understand Your actual
position.
PURPORT

In Bhagavad-gita Krsna says that He descends to this material world
for two purposes, namely paritrandya sadhindrr vindsdya ca
duskrtam—to relieve the devotees and kill demons or nondevotees.
These two kinds of action are the same for the Absolute Truth. When the
Lord comes to punish the demons, He bestows His favor upon them, and
similarly when He delivers His devotees and gives them relief, He also
bestows His favor. Thus the Lord bestows His favor equally upon the
conditioned souls. When a conditioned soul gives relief to others he acts
piously, and when he gives trouble to others he acts impiously, but the
Lord is neither pious nor impious; He is always full in His spiritual
potency, by which He shows equal mercy to the punishable and the pro-
tectable. The Lord is apapa-viddham; He is never contaminated by the
reactions of so-called sinful activities. When Krsna was present on this
earth, He killed many inimical nondevotees, but they all received
saripya; in other words, they returned to their original spiritual bodies.
One who does not know the Lord’s position says that God is unkind to
him but merciful to others. Actually the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita
(9.29), samo ham sarva-bhitesu na me dvesyo ’sti na priyah: “I am
equal to everyone. No one is My enemy, and no one is My friend.” But
He also says, ye bhajanti tu mar bhaktya mayi te tesu capy aham: “If
one becomes My devotee and fully surrenders unto Me, I give him special
attention.”

TRANSLATION

O Supreme Personality of Godhead, all contradictions can be
reconciled in You. O Lord, since You are the Supreme Person, the
reservoir of unlimited spiritual qualities, the supreme controller,
Your unlimited glories are inconceivable to the conditioned souls.
Many modern theologians argue about right and wrong without
knowing what is actually right. Their arguments are always false
and their judgments inconclusive because they have no authorized
evidence with which to gain knowledge of You. Because their
minds are agitated by scriptures containing false conclusions, they


--- Page 136 ---
Text 36] The Appearance of the Demon Vrtrasura 131
are unable to understand the truth concerning You. Furthermore,
because of polluted eagerness to arrive at the right conclusion,
their theories are incapable of revealing You, who are transcen-
dental to their material conceptions. You are one without a second,
and therefore in You contradictions like doing and not doing, hap-
piness and distress, are not contradictory. Your potency is so great
that it can do and undo anything as You like. With the help of that
potency, what is impossible for You? Since there is no duality in
Your constitutional position, You can do everything by the
influence of Your energy.
PURPORT

The Supreme Personality of Godhead, being self-sufficient, is full of
transcendental bliss (@tmarama). He enjoys bliss in two ways—when He
appears happy and when He appears distressed. Distinctions and
contradictions are impossible in Him because only from Him have they
emanated. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the reservoir of all
knowledge, all potency, all strength, opulence and influence. There is no
limit to His powers. Since He is full in all transcendental attributes,
nothing abominable from the material world can exist in Him. He is
transcendental and spiritual, and therefore conceptions of material hap-
piness and distress do not apply to Him.

We should not be astonished to find contradictions in the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Actually there are no contradictions. That is the
meaning of His being supreme. Because He is all-powerful, He is not
subject to the conditioned soul’s arguments regarding His existence or
nonexistence. He is pleased to protect His devotees by killing their
enemies. He enjoys both the killing and the protecting.

Such freedom from duality applies not only to the Lord but also to His
devotees. In Vrndavana, the damsels of Vrajabhiimi enjoy transcendental
bliss in the company of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, and
they feel the same transcendental bliss in separation when Krsna and
Balarama leave Vrndavana for Mathura. There is no question of material
pains or pleasures for either the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His
pure devotees, although they are sometimes superficially said to be dis-
tressed or happy. One who is atmdrama is blissful in both ways.


--- Page 137 ---
132 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 6, Ch. 9

Nondevotees cannot understand the contradictions present in the
Supreme Lord or His devotees. Therefore in Bhagavad-gita the Lord
says. bhaktya mam abhijanati: the transcendental pastimes can be
understood through devotional service; to nondevotees they are incon-
ceivable. Acintyah khalu ye bhava na tars tarkena yojayet: the
Supreme Lord and His form, name, pastimes and paraphernalia are in-
conceivable to nondevotees, and one should not try to understand such
realities simply by logical arguments. They will not bring one to the right
conclusion about the Absolute Truth.

TEXT 37

समविषममतीनां मतमनुसरसि यथा IER: सर्पादिधियाम्‌ ।। ২৩।।
sama-visama-matinarh matam anusarasi yatha rajju-khandah sarpadi-
dhiyam.

sama—equal or proper; visama—and unequal or mistaken:
matinam —of those having intelligence; matam—conclusion;
anusarasi— You follow; yath@—just as; rajju-khandah—a piece of rope;
sarpa-adi—a snake, etc.; dhiyam—of those who perceive.

TRANSLATION

A rope causes fear for a bewildered person who considers it a
snake, but not for a person with proper intelligence who knows it
to be only a rope. Similarly, You, as the Supersoul in everyone’s
heart, inspire fear or fearlessness according to one’s intelligence,
but in You there is no duality.

PURPORT

In Bhagavad-gita (4.11) the Lord says, ye yatha mar prapadyante
tars tathaiva bhajamy aham: “As one surrenders unto Me, I reward
him accordingly.” The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the reservoir
of everything, including all knowledge, all truth and all contradictions.
The example cited herein is very appropriate. A rope is one truth, but
some mistake it for a snake, whereas others know it to be a rope.
Similarly, devotees who know the Supreme Personality of Godhead do


--- Page 138 ---
Text 38] The Appearance of the Demon Vrtrasura 133
not see contradictions in Him, but nondevotees regard Him as the
snakelike source of all fear. For example, when Nrsimhadeva appeared.
Prahlada Maharija saw the Lord as the supreme solace, whereas his
father, a demon, saw Him as the ultimate death. As stated in Srimad-
Bhagavatam (11.2.37), bhayari dvitiyabhinivesatah syat: fear results
from being absorbed in duality. When one is in knowledge of duality,
one knows both fear and bliss. The same Supreme Lord is a source of
bliss to devotees and fear to nondevotees who have a poor fund of knowl-
edge. God is one, but people understand the Absolute Truth from dif-
ferent angles of vision. The unintelligent see contradictions in Him, but
sober devotees find no contradictions.

sah—He (the Supreme Personality of Godhead); eva—indeed; hi—
certainly; punah—again; sarva-vastuni—in everything, material and
spiritual; vastu-svaripah—the substance; sarva-iSvarah—the controller
of everything; sakala-jagat—of the whole universe; karana—of the
causes; karana-bhiitah—existing as the cause; sarva-pratyak-atmat-
vat—because of being the Supersoul of every living being, or being pres-
ent in everything, even the atom; sarva-guna—of all the effects of the
material modes of nature (such as intelligence and the senses); abhasa —
by the manifestations; upalaksitah—perceived; ekah—alone; eva—in-
deed; paryavasesitah—left remaining.

TRANSLATION

With deliberation, one will see that the Supreme Soul, although
manifested in different ways, is actually the basic principle of
everything. The total material energy is the cause of the material
manifestation, but the material energy is caused by Him.


--- Page 139 ---
134 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 6, Ch. 9
Therefore He is the cause of all causes, the manifester of intelli-
gence and the senses. He is perceived as the Supersoul of every-
thing. Without Him, everything would be dead. You, as that
Supersoul, the supreme controller, are the only one remaining.
PURPORT

The words sarva-vastuni vastu-svaripah indicate that the Supreme
Lord is the active principle of everything. As described in the Brahma-
sarihita (5.35):

eko ‘py asau racayiturmh jagad-anda-kotirn
yac-chaktir asti jagad-anda-caya yad-antah
andantara-stha-paramanu-cayantara-stharn
govindam adi-purusari tam ahari bhajami
“I worship the Personality of Godhead, Govinda, who enters the exis-
tence of every universe and every atom by one of His plenary portions
and thus manifests His infinite energy throughout the material crea-
tion.” By His one plenary portion as Paramatma, antaryami, the Lord is
all-pervading throughout the unlimited universes. He is the pratyak, or
antaryami, of all living entities. The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (13.3),
ksetrajiiarn capi marin viddhi sarva-ksetresu bharata: “O scion of
Bharata, you should understand that I am also the knower in all bodies.™
Because the Lord is the Supersoul, He is the active principle of every liv-
ing entity and even the atom (andantara-stha-paramanu-cayantara-
stham). He is the actual reality. According to various stages of intelli-
gence, one realizes the presence of the Supreme in everything through
the manifestations of His energy. The entire world is permeated by the
three gunas, and one can understand His presence according to one’s
modes of material nature.

ship; visrjanti—can give up; na—not; yatra—wherein; punah—again;

TRANSLATION

Therefore, O killer of the Madhu demon, incessant transcen-

dental bliss flows in the minds of those who have even once tasted


--- Page 141 ---
136 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 6, Ch. 9
but a drop of the nectar from the ocean of Your glories. Such ex-
alted devotees forget the tiny reflection of so-called material hap-
piness produced from the material senses of sight and sound. Free
from all desires, such devotees are the real friends of all living en-
tities. Offering their minds unto You and enjoying transcendental
bliss, they are expert in achieving the real goal of life. O Lord, You
are the soul and dear friend of such devotees, who never need
return to this material world. How could they give up engagement
in Your devotional service?
PURPORT
Although nondevotees, because of their meager knowledge and specu-
lative habits, cannot understand the real nature of the Lord, a devotee
who has once tasted the nectar from the Lord’s lotus feet can realize what
transcendental pleasure there is in the Lord’s devotional service. A devo-
tee knows that simply by rendering service to the Lord, he serves every-
one. Therefore devotees are real friends toall living entities. Only a pure
devotee can preach the glories of the Lord for the benefit of all
conditioned souls.

TRANSLATION

O Lord, O personified three worlds, father of the three worlds!
O strength of the three worlds, in the form of the Vamana incarna-
tion! O three-eyed form of Nrsirmnhadeva! O most beautiful person
within the three worlds! Everything and everyone, including
human beings and even the Daitya demons and the Danavas, is but
an expansion of Your energy. O supremely powerful one, You have
always appeared in Your forms as the various incarnations to
punish the demons as soon as they become very powerful. You ap-
pear as Lord Vamanadeva, Lord Rama and Lord Krsna. You appear
sometimes as an animal like Lord Boar, sometimes a mixed incar-
nation like Lord Nrsirhhadeva and Lord Hayagriva, and sometimes
an aquatic like Lord Fish and Lord Tortoise. Assuming such
various forms, You have always punished the demons and Danavas.
We therefore pray that Your Lordship appear today as another in-
carnation, if You so desire, to kill the great demon Vrtrasura.

PURPORT

There are two kinds of devotees, known as sakama and akama. Pure

devotees are akama, whereas devotees in the upper planetary systems.


--- Page 143 ---
138 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 6, Ch. 9
such as the demigods, are called sakdma because they still want to enjoy
material opulence. Because of their pious activities, the sakama devotees
are promoted to the higher planetary systems, but at heart they still
desire to lord it over the material resources. The sakama devotees are
sometimes disturbed by the demons and Raksasas, but the Lord is so kind
that He always saves them by appearing as an incarnation. The Lord’s in-
carnations are so powerful that Lord Vamanadeva covered the entire uni-
verse with two steps and therefore had no place for His third step. The
Lord is called Trivikrama because He showed His strength by delivering
the entire universe with merely three steps.

The difference between sakama and akama devotees is that when
sakama devotees, like the demigods, fall into difficulty, they approach
the Supreme Personality of Godhead for relief, whereas akama devotees,
even in the greatest danger, never disturb the Lord for material benefits.
Even if an akama devotee is suffering, he thinks this is due to his past
impious activities and agrees to suffer the consequences. He never dis-
turbs the Lord. Sakama devotees immediately pray to the Lord as soon as
they are in difficulty, but they are regarded as pious because they con-
sider themselves fully dependent on the mercy of the Lord. As stated in
Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.14.8):

tat te ‘nukampam susamiksamano
bhunjana evatma-krtari vipakam
hrd-vag-vapurbhir vidadhan namas te
Jiveta yo mukti-pade sa daya-bhak
Even while suffering in the midst of difficulties, devotees simply offer
their prayers and service more enthusiastically. In this way they become
firmly fixed in devotional service and eligible to return home, back to
Godhead, without a doubt. Sakama devotees, of course, achieve from the
Lord the results they desire from their prayers, but they do not im-
mediately become fit to return to Godhead. It is to be noted herein that
Lord Visnu, in His various incarnations, is always the protector of His
devotees. Srila Madhvicarya says: vividham bhava-patratvat sarve visnor
vibhiitayah. Krsna is the original Personality of Godhead (krsnas tu
bhagavan svayam). All the other incarnations proceed from Lord Visnu.

smile of sympathy, and by the sweet, nectarean words emanating
from Your beautiful face, free us from the anxiety caused by this
Vrtrasura, who always pains the cores of our hearts.
PURPORT

Lord Brahma is considered the father of the demigods, but Krsna, or
Lord Visnu, is the father of Brahma because Brahma took birth from the
lotus flower growing from the Lord’s abdomen.

TRANSLATION

O Lord, as the small sparks of a fire cannot possibly perform the
actions of the whole fire, we sparks of Your Lordship cannot in-
form You of the necessities of our lives. You are the complete
whole. Therefore, of what do we need to inform You? You know
everything because You are the original cause of the cosmic
manifestation, the maintainer and the annihilator of the entire
universal creation. You always engage in Your pastimes with Your
spiritual and material energies, for You are the controller of all
these varied energies. You exist within all living entities, within
the cosmic manifestation, and also beyond them. You exist inter-
nally as Parabrahman and externally as the ingredients of the ma-
terial creation. Therefore, although manifested in various stages,
at different times and places, and in various bodies, You, the Per-
sonality of Godhead, are the original cause of all causes. Indeed,
You are the original element. You are the witness of all activities,
but because You are as great as the sky, You are never touched by
any of them. You are the witness of everything as Parabrahman
and Paramatma. O Supreme Personality of Godhead, nothing is
unknown to You.

PURPORT

The Absolute Truth exists in three phases of spiritual understand-
ing—Brahman, Paramitma and Bhagavan (brahmeti paramatmeti
bhagavan iti sabdyate). Bhagavan, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
is the cause of Brahman and Paramatma. Brahman, the impersonal Ab-
solute Truth, is all-pervading, and Paramatma is locally situated in
everyone's heart, but Bhagavan, who is worshipable by the devotees. is


--- Page 147 ---
142 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 6, Ch. 9
the original cause of all causes. A pure devotee is aware that since
nothing is unknown to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He need not
be informed of a devotee’s conveniences and inconveniences. A pure
devotee knows that there is no need to ask the Absolute Truth for any
material necessities. Therefore, while informing the Supreme Lord about
their distress in being attacked by Vrtrasura, the demigods apologized
for offering prayers for their safety. A neophyte devotee, of course, ap-
proaches the Supreme Lord for relief from distress or poverty, or for
speculative knowledge of the Lord. Bhagavad-gita (7.16) mentions four
kinds of pious men who begin devotional service to the Lord —one who is
distressed (arta), one in need of money (artharthi), one who is inquisi-
tive (jijiasu) and one who is searching for the Absolute Truth (jiani). A
pure devotee, however, knows that since the Lord is omnipresent and
omniscient, there is no need to offer prayers or worship Him for one’s
personal benefit. A pure devotee always engages in the service of the
Lord without demanding anything. The Lord is present everywhere and
knows the necessities of His devotees; consequently there is no need to
disturb Him by asking Him for material benefits.

TRANSLATION

Dear Lord, You are omniscient, and therefore You know very
well why we have taken shelter at Your lotus feet, which provide
shade that gives relief from all material disturbances. Since You
are the supreme spiritual master and You know everything, we
have sought shelter of Your lotus feet for instruction. Please give
us relief by counteracting our present distress. Your lotus feet are
the only shelter for a fully surrendered devotee and are the only
means for subduing all the tribulations of this material world.

PURPORT

One need only seek shelter of the shade of the Lord’s lotus feet. Then
all the material tribulations that disturb him will be subdued, just as
when one comes under the shadow of a big tree, the disturbances caused
by the heat of the scorching sun are immediately mitigated, without
one’s asking for relief. Therefore the whole concern of the conditioned
soul should be the lotus feet of the Lord. The conditioned soul suffering
from various tribulations because of existing in this material world can
be relieved only when he seeks shelter at the Lord’s lotus feet.

and our strength and influence.

PURPORT
The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (7.15-16):
na mar duskrtino miadhah
prapadyante naradhamah
mayayapahrta-jiana
asurarn bhavam asritah
catur-vidha bhajante mari
janah sukrtino ’rjuna

“Those miscreants who are grossly foolish, lowest among mankind,
whose knowledge is stolen by illusion, and who partake of the atheistic
nature of demons, do not surrender unto Me. O best among the Bharatas
[Arjunal, four kinds of pious men render devotional service unto Me—
the distressed, the desirer of wealth, the inquisitive, and he who is
searching for knowledge of the Absolute.”

The four classes of neophyte devotees who approach the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead to offer devotional service because of material mo-
tives are not pure devotees, but the advantage for such materialistic
devotees is that they sometimes give up their material desires and be-
come pure. When the demigods are utterly helpless, they approach the
Supreme Personality of Godhead in grief and with tears in their eyes,
praying to the Lord, and thus they become almost pure devotees, free
from material desires. Admitting that they have forgotten pure devo-
tional service because of extensive material opportunities, they fully sur-
render to the Lord, leaving to His consideration whether to maintain
them or annihilate them. Such surrender is necessary. Bhaktivinoda

O Lord, O supreme pure, You live within the core of everyone’s
heart and observe all the desires and activities of the conditioned
souls. O Supreme Personality of Godhead known as Lord Krsna,
Your reputation is bright and illuminating. You have no begin-
ning, for You are the beginning of everything. This is understood
by pure devotees because You are easily accessible to the pure and

truthful. When the conditioned souls are liberated and sheltered
at Your lotus feet after roving throughout the material world for
many millions of years, they attain the highest success of life.
Therefore, O Lord, O Supreme Personality of Godhead, we offer
our respectful obeisances at Your lotus feet.

PURPORT

The demigods certainly wanted Lord Visnu to relieve their anxiety,
but now they directly approach Lord Krsna, for although there is no dif-
ference between Lord Krsna and Lord Visnu, Krsna descends to this
planet in His Vasudeva feature for the purpose of paritranaya
sadhinarm vinasaya ca duskrtam—protecting His devotees and annihi-
lating the miscreants. Demons, or atheists, always disturb the demigods,
or devotees, and therefore Krsna descends to punish the atheists and
demons and fulfill the desire of His devotees. Krsna, being the original
cause of everything, is the Supreme Person, above even Visnu and
Narayana, although there is no difference between these different forms
of the Lord. As explained in Brahma-sarihita (5.46):

diparcir eva hi dasantaram abhyupetya
dipayate vivrta-hetu-samana-dharma
yas tadrg eva hi ca visnutaya vibhati
govindam adi-purusari tam aha bhajami
Krsna expands Himself as Visnu the way a bright candle kindles another.
Although there is no difference between the power of one candle and
another, Krsna is compared to the original candle.

The word mrsta-yasase is significant herein because Krsna is always
famous for relieving His devotee from danger. A devotee who has
sacrificed everything for the service of Krsna and whose only source of
relief is the Lord is known as akiicana.

As expressed in the prayers offered by Queen Kunti, the Lord is
akinicana-vitta, the property of such a devotee. Those who are liberated
from the bondage of conditioned life are elevated to the spiritual world,
where they achieve five kinds of liberation —sayujya, salokya, saripya,
sarsti and samipya. They personally associate with the Lord in five


--- Page 152 ---
Text 47] The Appearance of the Demon Vrtrasura 147
mellows—3anta, dasya, sakhya, vatsalya and madhurya. These rasas
are all emanations from Krsna. As described by Visvanatha Cakravarti
Thakura, the original mellow, @di-rasa, is conjugal love. Krsna is the
origin of pure and spiritual conjugal love.

TRANSLATION
The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: O beloved demigods,
you have offered your prayers to Me with great knowledge, and 1
am certainly most pleased with you. A person is liberated by such
knowledge, and thus he remembers My exalted position, which is
above the conditions of material life. Such a devotee is fully
purified by offering prayers in full knowledge. This is the source
of devotional service to Me.
PURPORT
Another name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is Uttamasloka,
which means that He is offered prayers with selected verses. Bhakti
means Sravanari kirtanar vispoh, chanting and hearing about Lord
Visnu. Impersonalists cannot be purified, for they do not offer personal
prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even though they some-
times offer prayers, the prayers are not directed toward the Supreme
Person. Impersonalists sometimes show their incomplete knowledge by
addressing the Lord as being nameless. They always offer prayers in-
directly, saying, “You are this, You are that,” but they do not know to
whom they are praying. A devotee, however, always offers personal
prayers. A devotee says, govindam adi-purusari tam aharih bhajami: न्‌
offer my respectful obeisances unto Govinda, unto Krspa.”” That is the


--- Page 154 ---
Text 48] The Appearance of the Demon Vrtrasura 149
way to offer prayers. If one continues to offer such personal prayers to
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is eligible to become a pure
devotee and return home, back to Godhead.

O best of the intelligent demigods, although it is true that
nothing is difficult for one to obtain when I am pleased with him, a
pure devotee, whose mind is exclusively fixed upon Me, does not
ask Me for anything but the opportunity to engage in devotional
service.
PURPORT
When the demigods finished offering their prayers, they anxiously
waited for their enemy Vrtrasura to be killed. This means that the
demigods are not pure devotees. Although without difficulty one can get
anything he desires if the Lord is pleased, the demigods aspire for ma-
terial profit by pleasing the Lord. The Lord wanted the demigods to pray
for unalloyed devotional service, but instead they prayed for an oppor-
tunity to kill their enemy. This is the difference between a pure devotee
and a devotee on the material platform. Indirectly, the Lord regretted
that the demigods did not ask for pure devotional service.

TRANSLATION
Those who think material assets to be everything or to be the
ultimate goal of life are called misers [krpanas]. They do not know
the ultimate necessity of the soul. Moreover, if one awards that
which is desired by such fools, he must also be considered foolish.
PURPORT

There are two classes of men—namely the Arpana and the brahmana.
A brahmana is one who knows Brahman, the Absolute Truth, and who
thus knows his real interest. A krpana, however, is one who has a ma-
terial, bodily concept of life. Not knowing how to utilize his human or
demigod life, a Arpana is attracted by things created by the material
modes of nature. The krpanas, who always desire material benefits, are
foolish, whereas brahmanas, who always desire spiritual benefits, are in-
telligent. If a Arpana, not knowing his self-interest, foolishly asks for
something material, one who awards it to him is also foolish. Krsna,
however, is not a foolish person; He is supremely intelligent. If someone
comes to Krsna asking for material benefits, Krsna does not award him
the material things he desires. Instead, the Lord gives him intelligence so
that he will forget his material desires and become attached to the Lord’s


--- Page 156 ---
Text 50] The Appearance of the Demon Vrtrasura 151
lotus feet. In such cases, although the krpana offers prayers to Lord
Krsna for material things, the Lord takes away whatever material posses-
sions the krpana has and gives him the sense to become a devotee. As
stated by the Lord in the Caitanya-caritamrta (Madhya 22.39):
ami—vijiia, ei murkhe ‘visaya’ kene diba?
sva-caranamrta diya ‘visaya’ bhulaiba
“Since 1 am very intelligent, why should I give this fool material
prosperity? Instead I shall induce him to take the nectar of the shelter of
My lotus feet and make him forget illusory material enjoyment.” If one
sincerely prays to God for material possessions in exchange for devo-
tional service, the Lord, who is not foolish like such an unintelligent
devotee, shows him special favor by taking away whatever material
possessions he has and gradually giving him the intelligence to be
satisfied only by rendering service to His lotus feet. Srila Visvanatha
Cakravarti Thakura comments in this regard that if a foolish child re-
quests his mother to give him poison, the mother, being intelligent, will
certainly not give him poison, even though he requests it. A materialist
does not know that to accept material possessions means to accept poison,
or the repetition of birth and death. An intelligent person, a brahmana,
aspires for liberation from material bondage. That is the real self-
interest of a human being.

TRANSLATION

A pure devotee who is fully accomplished in the science of devo-
tional service will never instruct a foolish person to engage in
fruitive activities for material enjoyment, not to speak of helping
him in such activities. Such a devotee is like an experienced physi-
cian, who never encourages a patient to eat food injurious to his
health, even if the patient desires it.

PURPORT

Here is the difference between the benedictions awarded by the
demigods and those awarded by the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Visnu. Devotees of the demigods ask for benedictions simply for sense

ratification, and therefore they have been described in Bhagavad-gita
(720) as bereft of intelligence.
kamais tais tair hrta-jaanah
prapadyante ‘nya-devatah
1077 tarh niyamam dsthaya
prakrtya niyatah svaya
“Those whose minds are distorted by material desires surrender unto
demigods and follow the particular rules and regulations of worship ac-
cording to their own natures.”

Conditioned souls are generally bereft of intelligence because of pro-
found desires for sense gratification. They do not know what benedic-
tions to ask. Therefore nondevotees are advised in the sastras to worship
various demigods to achieve material benefits. For example, if one wants
a beautiful wife, he is advised to worship Uma, or goddess Durga. If one
wants to be cured of a disease, he is advised to worship the sun-god. All
requests for benedictions from the demigods, however, are due to ma-


--- Page 158 ---
Text 50] The Appearance of the Demon Vrtrasura 153
terial lust. The benedictions will be finished at the end of the cosmic
manifestation, along with those who bestow them. If one approaches
Lord Visnu for benedictions, the Lord will give him a benediction that
will help him return home, back to Godhead. This is also confirmed by
the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gita (10.10):
tesa satata-yuktandar
bhajatam priti-pirvakam
dadami buddhi-yogari 1077
yena mam upayanti te
Lord Visnu, or Lord Krsna, instructs a devotee who constantly engages in
His service how to approach Him at the end of his material body. The
Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (4.9):
janma karma ca me divyam
evar yo vetti tattvatah
tyaktva deham punar janma
naiti mam eti so ‘rjuna
“One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and ac-
tivities, does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this ma-
terial world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.” This is the
benediction of Lord Visnu, Krsna. After giving up his body, a devotee
returns home, back to Godhead.

A devotee may foolishly ask for material benedictions, but Lord Krsna
does not give him such benedictions, despite the devotee’s prayers.
Therefore people who are very attached to material life do not generally
become devotees of Krsna or Visnu. Instead they become devotees of the
demigods (kamais tais tair hrta-jiianah prapadyante ‘nya-devatah). The
benedictions of the demigods, however, are condemned in Bhagavad-
git. Antavat tu phalam tesar tad bhavaty alpa-medhasam: “Men of
small intelligence worship the demigods, and their fruits are limited and
temporary.” A non-Vaisnava, one who is not engaged in the service of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is considered a fool with a small
quantity of brain substance.

O Maghavan [Indra], all good fortune unto you. I advise you to
approach the exalted saint Dadhyafica [Dadhici]. He has become
very accomplished in knowledge, vows and austerities, and his
body is very strong. Go ask him for his body without delay.
PURPORT
Everyone in this material world, from Lord Brahma down to the ant, is
eager to keep his body comfortable. A pure devotee may also be comfor-
table, but he is not eager for such a benediction. Since Maghavan, the
King of heaven, still aspired for a comfortable bodily situation, Lord
Visnu advised him to ask Dadhyaiica for his body, which was very strong
due to his knowledge, vows and austerity.

TRANSLATION

That saintly Dadhyafica, who is also known as Dadhici, per-
sonally assimilated the spiritual science and then delivered it to the
ASvini-kumaras. It is said that Dadhyafica gave them mantras
through the head of a horse. Therefore the mantras are called
ASvaSira. After obtaining the mantras of spiritual science from
Dadhici, the AsSvini-kumaras became jivan-mukta, liberated even
in this life.

PURPORT

The following story is narrated by many dcaryas in their commen-
taries:

The great saint Dadhici had perfect knowledge of how to perform
fruitive activities, and he had advanced spiritual knowledge as well.
Knowing this, the Asvini-kumaras once approached him and begged him
to instruct them in spiritual science (brahma-vidya). Dadhici Muni
replied, “I am now engaged in arranging sacrifices for fruitive activities.
Come back some time later.” When the Asvini-kumaras left. Indra. the


--- Page 161 ---
156 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 6, Ch. 9
King of heaven, approached Dadhici and said, “My dear Muni, the
Asvini-kumaras are only physicians. Please do not instruct them in
spiritual science. If you impart the spiritual science to them despite my
warning, I shall punish you by cutting off your head.” After warning
Dadhici in this way, Indra returned to heaven. The Asvini-kumaras, who
understood Indra’s desires, returned and begged Dadhici for brahma-
vidya. When the great saint Dadhici informed them of Indra’s threat, the
Aévini-kumaras replied, “Let us first cut off your head and replace it
with the head of a horse. You can instruct brahma-vidya through the
horse’s head, and when Indra returns and cuts off that head, we shall
reward you and restore your original head.” Since Dadhici had promised
to impart brahma-vidya to the ASvini-kumaras, he agreed to their pro-
posal. Therefore, because Dadhici imparted brahma-vidya through the
mouth of a horse. this brahma-vidya is also known as 45५३5778.

pare a thunderbolt from his bones. This thunderbolt will certainly
kill Vrtrasura because it will be invested with My power.

TRANSLATION

When Vrtrasura is killed because of My spiritual strength, you
will regain your strength, weapons and wealth. Thus there will be
all good fortune for all of you. Although Vrtrasura can destroy all
the three worlds, do not fear that he will harm you. He is also a
devotee and will never be envious of you.

PURPORT

A devotee of the Lord is never envious of anyone, what to speak of
other devotees. As revealed later, Vrtrasura was also a devotee.
Therefore he was not expected to be envious of the demigods. Indeed, of
his own accord, he would try to benefit the demigods. A devotee does not
hesitate to give up his own body for a better cause. Canakya Pandita said,
san-nimitte varam tyago vinase niyate sati. After all, all one’s material
possessions, including his body, will be destroyed in due course of time.
Therefore if the body and other possessions can be utilized for a better
cause, a devotee never hesitates to give up even his own body. Because
Lord Visnu wanted to save the demigods, Vrtrasura, even though able to
swallow the three worlds, would agree to be killed by the demigods. For a
devotee there is no difference between living and dying because in this
life a devotee engages in devotional service, and after giving up his
body, he engages in the same service in the spiritual world. His
devotional service is never hindered.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports to the Ninth Chapter, Sixth
Canto, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “Appearance of the Demon
Vrtrasura.”

CHAPTER TEN
The Battle Between
the Demigods and Vrtrasura
As described in this chapter, after Indra obtained the body of Dadhici, a
thunderbolt was prepared from Dadhici’s bones, and a fight took place
between Vrtrasura and the demigods.

Following the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the
demigods approached Dadhici Muni and begged for his body. Dadhici
Muni, just to hear from the demigods about the principles of religion,
jokingly refused to relinquish his body, but for higher purposes he
thereafter agreed to give it up, for after death the body is usually eaten
by low animals like dogs and jackals. Dadhici Muni first merged his gross
body made of five elements into the original stock of five elements and
then engaged his soul at the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Thus he gave up his gross body. With the help of Vi§vakarma,
the demigods then prepared a thunderbolt from Dadhici’s bones. Armed
with the thunderbolt weapon, they prepared themselves to fight and got
up on the backs of elephants.

At the end of Satya-yuga and the beginning of Treta-yuga. a great
fight took place between the demigods and the asuras. Unable to tolerate
the effulgence of the demigods, the asuras fled the battle, leaving
Vrtrasura, their commander in chief, to fight for himself. Vrtrasura,
however, seeing the demons fleeing, instructed them in the importance
of fighting and dying in the battlefield. One who is victorious in battle
gains material possessions, and one who dies in the battlefield attains a
residence at once in the celestial heavens. In either way, the fighter
benefits.

In this material world, every living entity is very much addicted
to his material body. Struggling to keep his body forever, every-
one tries to protect it by all means, even at the sacrifice of all his
possessions. Therefore, who would be prepared to deliver his body
to anyone, even if it were demanded by Lord Visnu?

PURPORT

It is said, atmanarn sarvato rakset tato dharmari tato dhanam: one
must protect his body by all means; then he may protect his religious
principles and thereafter his possessions. This is the natural desire of all
living entities. No one wants to give up his body unless it is forcibly
given away. Even though the demigods said that they were demanding
Dadhici’s body for their benefit in accordance with the order of Lord
Visnu, Dadhici superficially refused to give them his body.

Those who are too self-interested beg something from others,
not knowing of others’ pain. But if the beggar knew the difficulty
of the giver, he would not ask for anything. Similarly, he who is
able to give charity does not know the beggar’s difficulty, for
otherwise he would not refuse to give the beggar anything he
might want as charity.

PURPORT

This verse describes two people —one who gives charity and one who
begs for it. A beggar should not ask charity from a person who is in dif-
ficulty. Similarly. one who is able to give charity should not deny a beg-
gar. These are the moral instructions of the sastra. Canakya Pandita says.
san-nimitte varam tyago vinase niyate sati: everything within this ma-
terial world will be destroyed, and therefore one should use everything

for good purposes. If one is advanced in knowledge, he must always be
prepared to sacrifice anything for a better cause. At the present moment
the entire world is in a dangerous position under the spell of a godless
civilization. The Krsna consciousness movement needs many exalted,
learned persons who will sacrifice their lives to revive God consciousness
throughout the world. We therefore invite all men and women advanced
in knowledge to join the Krsna consciousness movement and sacrifice
their lives for the great cause of reviving the God consciousness of
human society.

O demigods, one who has no compassion for humanity in its

PURPORT
In this regard, a very exalted example was set by Lord Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu and the six Gosvamis of Vrndavana. Concerning Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu it is said in Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.5.34):
tyaktva sudustyaja-surepsita-rajya-laksmirn
dharmistha arya-vacasa yad agad aranyam
maya-mrgarh dayitayepsitam anvadhavad
vande maha-purusa te caranaravindam
“We offer our respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of the Lord. upon
whom one should always meditate. He left His householder life, leaving
aside His eternal consort, whom even the denizens of heaven adore. He
went into the forest to deliver the fallen souls, who are put into illusion
by material energy.” To accept sannyasa means to commit civil suicide.
but sannydsa is compulsory, at least for every brahmana, every first-
class human being. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu had a very young and
beautiful wife and a very affectionate mother. Indeed, the affectionate
dealings of His family members were so pleasing that even the demigods
could not expect such happiness at home. Nevertheless. for the


--- Page 171 ---
166 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 6, Ch. 10
deliverance of all the fallen souls of the world, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu
took sannyasa and left home when He was only twenty-four years old.
He lived a very strict life as a sannyast, refusing all bodily comforts.
Similarly. His disciples the six Gosvamis were ministers who held exalted
positions in society, but they also left everything to join the movement of
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Srinivasa Acarya says:

tyaktva tirnam asesa-mandala-pati-Srenimm sada tucchavat

bhitva dina-ganesakau karunaya kaupina-kanthasritau

These Gosvamis left their very comfortable lives as ministers. Zamindars
and learned scholars and joined Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s movement,
just to show mercy to the fallen souls of the world (dina-ganesakau
karunaya). Accepting very humble lives as mendicants. wearing no
more than loincloths and torn quilts (kaupina-kantha). they lived in
Vrndavana and followed Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s order to excavate
Vrndavana’s lost glories.

Similarly. everyone else with a materially comfortable condition in
this world should join the Krsna consciousness movement to elevate the
fallen souls. The words bhiita-dayaya, maya-mrgar dayitayepsitam
and dina-ganesakau karunaya all convey the same sense. These are very
significant words for those interested in elevating human society to a
proper understanding of life. One should join the Krsna consciousness
movement, following the examples of such great personalities as Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu, the six Gosvamis and, before them, the great sage
Dadhici. Instead of wasting one’s life for temporary bodily comforts, one
should always be prepared to give up one’s life for better causes. After
all. the body will be destroyed. Therefore one should sacrifice it for the
glory of distributing religious principles throughout the world.

yo bhuta-Soka-harsabhyam

etavan—this much; avyayah—imperishable; dharmah—religious
principle; punya-slokaih—by famous persons who are celebrated as
pious; updsitah—recognized; yah—which; bhiita—of the living beings:
Soka—Dby the distress; harsabhyam —and by the happiness: atma—the
mind; Socati—laments; hrsyati—feels happiness.

TRANSLATION

If one is unhappy to see the distress of other living beings and
happy to see their happiness, his religious principles are appreci-
ated as imperishable by exalted persons who are considered pious
and benevolent.

PURPORT

One generally follows different types of religious principles or per-
forms various occupational duties according to the body given to him by
the modes of material nature. In this verse, however, real religious prin-
ciples are explained. Everyone should be unhappy to see others in dis-
tress and happy to see others happy. Atmavat sarva-bhiitesu: one should
feel the happiness and distress of others as his own. It is on this basis that
the Buddhist religious principle of nonviolence—ahimsah parama-
dharmah—is established. We feel pain when someone disturbs us, and
therefore we should not inflict pain upon other living beings. Lord Bud-
dha’s mission was to stop unnecessary animal killing, and therefore he
preached that the greatest religious principle is nonviolence.

One cannot continue killing animals and at the same time be a
religious man. That is the greatest hypocrisy. Jesus Christ said, “Do not
kill,” but hypocrites nevertheless maintain thousands of slaughterhouses
while posing as Christians. Such hypocrisy is condemned in this verse.
One should be happy to see others happy, and one should be unhappy to
see others unhappy. This is the principle to be followed. Unfortunately.
at the present moment so-called philanthropists and humanitarians advo-
cate the happiness of humanity at the cost of the lives of poor animals.
That is not recommended herein. This verse clearly says that one should
be compassionate to all living entities. Regardless of whether human.

animal. tree or plant. all living entities are sons of the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead. Lord Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (14.4):
sarva-yonisu kaunteya
miirtayah sambhavanti yah
12507 brahma mahad yonir
aharh bija-pradah pita
"न+ should be understood that all species of life, O son of Kunti, are made
possible by birth in this material nature, and that I am the seed-giving
father.” The different forms of these living entities are only their exter-
nal dresses. Every living being is actually a spirit soul. a part and parcel
of God. Therefore one should not favor only one kind of living being. A
Vaisnava sees all living entities as part and parcel of God. As the Lord
says in Bhagavad-gita (5.18 and 18.54):
vidya-vinaya-sampanne
brahmane gavi hastini
Suni caiva Svapake ca
panditah sama-darsinah
“The humble sage, by virtue of true knowledge. sees with equal vision a
learned and gentle brahmana, a cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater
[outcaste].”
brahma-bhiitah prasannatma
na Socati na kariksati
samah sarvesu bhiitesu
mad-bhaktiri labhate param
“One who is transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme
Brahman and becomes fully joyful. He never laments nor desires to have
anything: he is equally disposed to every living entity. In that state he at-
tains pure devotional service unto Me.”” A Vaisnava. therefore. is truly a
perfect person because he laments to see others unhappy and feels joy at
seeing others happy. A Vaisnava is para-duhkha-duhkhi; he is always
unhappy to see the conditioned souls in an unhappy state of materialism.


--- Page 174 ---
Text 10] Battle Between the Demigods and Vrtrasura 169
Therefore a Vaisnava is always busy preaching Krsna consciousness
throughout the world.

TRANSLATION
This body, which is eatable by jackals and dogs after death, does
not actually do any good for me, the spirit soul. It is usable only
for a short time and may perish at any moment. The body and its
possessions, its riches and relatives, must all be engaged for the
benefit of others, or else they will be sources of tribulation and
misery.
PURPORT
Similar advice is also given in Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.22.35):
etavaj janma-saphalyam
dehinam iha dehisu
pranair arthair dhiya vaca
Sreya dcaranam sada
“It is the duty of every living being to perform welfare activities for the
benefit of others with his life, wealth, intelligence and words.” This is


--- Page 175 ---
170 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 6, Ch. 10
the mission of life. One's own body and the bodies of his friends and
relatives. as well as one’s own riches and everything else one has, should
be engaged for the benefit of others. This is the mission of Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu. As stated in Caitanya-caritamrta (Adi 9.41):
bharata-bhimite haila manusya-janma yara
Jjanma sarthaka kari’ kara para-upakara
“One who has taken birth as a human being in the land of India
[Bharata-varsa] should make his life successful and work for the benefit
of all other people.

The word upakuryat means para-upakara, helping others. Of course,
in human society there are many institutions to help others, but because
philanthropists do not know how to help others, their propensity for
philanthropy is ineffectual. They do not know the ultimate goal of life
(sreya acaranam), which is to please the Supreme Lord. If all
philanthropic and humanitarian activities were directed toward achiev-
ing the ultimate goal of life—to please the Supreme Personality of God-
head —they would all be perfect. Humanitarian work without Krsna
is nothing. Krsna must be brought to the center of all our activities;
otherwise no activity will have value.

TRANSLATION

Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said: Dadhici Muni, the son of Atharva,
thus resolved to give his body to the service of the demigods. He
placed himself, the spirit soul, at the lotus feet of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead and in this way gave up his gross material
body made of five elements.

PURPORT

As indicated by the words pare bhagavati brahmany atmanam san-
nayan, Dadhici placed himself, as spirit soul, at the lotus feet of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this regard, one may refer to the in-
cident of Dhrtarastra’s leaving his body, as described in the First Canto
of Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.13.55). Dhrtarastra analytically divided his
gross material body into the five different elements of which it was
made —earth, water, fire, air and ether —and distributed them to the ता
ferent reservoirs of these elements: in other words, he merged these five
elements into the original mahat-tattva. By identifying his material con-
ception of life, he gradually separated his spirit soul from material con-
nections and placed himself at the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. The example given in this connection is that when an
earthen pot is broken, the small portion of the sky within the pot is
united with the large sky outside the pot. Mayavadi philosophers mis-
understand this description of Srimad-Bhagavatam. Therefore Sri
Ramanuja Svami, in his book Vedanta-tattva-sara, has described that
this merging of the soul means that after separating himself from the
material body made of eight elements—earth, water, fire. air, ether.
false ego, mind and intelligence —the individual soul engages himself in
devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His eternal
form (iSvarah paramah krsnah sac-cid-ananda-vigrahah/ anadir adir
govindah sarva-karana-karanam). The material cause of the material
elements absorbs the material body, and the spiritual soul assumes its
original position. As described by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, jwera
‘svaripa’ haya—krsnera ‘nitya-dasa’: the constitutional position of


--- Page 177 ---
172 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 6, Ch. 10
the living entity is that he is the eternal servant of Krsna. When one
overcomes the material body through cultivation of spiritual knowledge
and devotional service, one can revive his own position and thus engage
in the service of the Lord.

Dadhici Muni controlled his senses, life force, mind and intelli-
gence and became absorbed in trance. Thus he cut all his material
bonds. He could not perceive how his material body became
separated from his self.

The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (8.5):

“Whoever, at the time of death, quits his body remembering Me alone, at
once attains My nature. Of this there is no doubt.” Of course, one must

practice before one is overcome by death, but the perfect yogi, namely
the devotee, dies in trance, thinking of Krsna. He does not feel his ma-
terial body being separated from his soul; the soul is immediately
transferred to the spiritual world. Tyaktva deharn punar janma naiti
mam eti: the soul does not enter the womb of a material mother again,
but is transferred back home, back to Godhead. This yoga, bhakti-yoga,
is the highest yoga system, as explained by the Lord Himself in
Bhagavad-gita (6.47):
yoginam api sarvesari
mad-gatenantaratmana
Sraddhavan bhajate yo mam
sa me yuktatamo matah
“Of all yogis, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping
Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in
yoga and is the highest of all.” The bhakti-yogi always thinks of Krsna,
and therefore at the time of death he can very easily transfer himself to
Krsnaloka, without even perceiving the pains of death.

Thereafter, King Indra very firmly took up the thunderbolt

with the exalted power of Dadhici Muni and enlightened by the
power of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Indra rode on the

while all the great sages offered him praise. Thus he shone very
beautifully, pleasing the three worlds as he rode off to kill
Vrtrasura.

Thereafter, at the end of Satya-yuga and the beginning of Treta-

five sacred rivers in India—Ganga, Yamuna, Narmada, Kaveri and
Krsna —are all celestial. Like the Ganges River, the Narmada River also
flows in the higher planetary systems. The battle between the demigods
and the demons took place in the higher planets.
The words prathame yuge mean “in the beginning of the first millen-
nium,” that is to say, in the beginning of the Vaivasvata manvantara. In

one day of Brahma there are fourteen Manus, who each live for seventy-
one millenniums. The four yugas—Satya, Treta, Dvapara and Kali—
constitute one millennium. We are presently in the manvantara of
Vaivasvata Manu, who is mentioned in Bhagavad-gita (imam vivasvate
yoga proktavan aham avyayam/ vivasvan manave praha). We are now
in the twenty-eighth millennium of Vaivasvata Manu, but this fight took
place in the beginning of Vaivasvata Manu’s first millennium. One can
historically calculate how long ago the battle took place. Since each
millennium consists of 4,300,000 years and we are now in the twenty-
eighth millennium, some 120,400,000 years have passed since the battle
took place on the bank of the River Narmada.

When the soldiers of the demons, commanded by Vrtrasura, saw
that the soldiers of King Indra were quite well, having not been in-
jured at all by their volleys of weapons, not even by the trees,
stones and mountain peaks, the demons were very much afraid.

When insignificant persons use rough words to cast false, angry
accusations against saintly persons, their fruitless words do not
disturb the great personalities. Similarly, all the efforts of the
demons against the demigods, who were favorably situated under
the protection of Krsna, were futile.
PURPORT
There is a Bengali saying that if a vulture curses a cow to die, the curse
will not be effective. Similarly, accusations made by demoniac persons
against devotees of Krsna cannot have any effect. The demigods are
devotees of Lord Krsna, and therefore the curses of the demons were
futile.

the very beginning of the fight, they decided to flee because all
their prowess had been taken away by the enemy.

TRANSLATION

Vrtrasura said: All living entities who have taken birth in this
material world must die. Surely, no one in this world has found
any means to be saved from death. Even providence has not pro-
vided a means to escape it. Under the circumstances, death being
inevitable, if one can gain promotion to the higher planetary
systems and be always celebrated here by dying a suitable death,
what man will not accept such a glorious death?

PURPORT

If by dying one can be elevated to the higher planetary systems and be
ever-famous after his death, who is so foolish that he will refuse such a
glorious death? Similar advice was also given by Krsna to Arjuna. “My
dear Arjuna,” the Lord said, “00 not desist from fighting. If you gain
victory in the fight, you will enjoy a kingdom, and even if you die you


--- Page 191 ---
186 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 6, Ch. 10
will be elevated to the heavenly planets.”” Everyone should be ready to
die while performing glorious deeds. A glorious person is not meant to
meet death like cats and dogs.

TRANSLATION

There are two ways to meet a glorious death, and both are very
rare. One is to die after performing mystic yoga, especially bhakti-
yoga, by which one can control the mind and living force and die
absorbed in thought of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The
second is to die on the battlefield, leading the army and never
showing one’s back. These two kinds of death are recommended in
the Sastra as glorious.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Sixth Canto, Tenth
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled ‘The Battle Between the
Demigods and Vrtrasura.”

CHAPTER ELEVEN

The Transcendental Qualities of Vrtrasura
This chapter describes Vrtrasura’s great qualities. When the prominent
commanders of the demons fled, not hearing Vrtrasura’s advice,
Vrtrasura condemned them all as cowards. Speaking very bravely, he
stood alone to face the demigods. When the demigods saw Vrtrasura’s at-
titude, they were so afraid that they practically fainted, and Vrtrasura
began trampling them down. Unable to tolerate this, Indra, the King of
the demigods, threw his club at Vrtrasura, but Vrtrasura was such a
great hero that he easily caught the club with his left hand and used it to
beat Indra’s elephant. Struck by the blow of Vrtrasura, the elephant was
pushed back fourteen yards and fell, with Indra on its back.

King Indra had first accepted Visvariipa as his priest and thereafter
killed him. Reminding Indra of his heinous activities, Vrtrasura said, “If
one is a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Visnu, and
depends on Lord Visnu in every respect, then victory, opulence and
peace of mind are all inevitably available. Such a person has nothing for
which to aspire in the three worlds. The Supreme Lord is so kind that He
especially favors such a devotee by not giving him opulence that will
hamper his devotional service. Therefore I wish to give up everything
for the service of the Lord. I wish always to chant the glories of the Lord
and engage in His service. Let me become unattached to my worldly
family and make friendships with the devotees of the Lord. I do not
desire to be promoted to the higher planetary systems, even to
Dhruvaloka or Brahmaloka, nor do I desire an unconquerable position
within this material world. I have no need for such things.”

TRANSLATION

O King Pariksit, the demigods, taking advantage of a favorable
opportunity presented by time, attacked the army of the demons
from the rear and began driving away the demoniac soldiers, scat-
tering them here and there as if their army had no leader. Seeing
the pitiable condition of his soldiers, Vrtrasura, the best of the
asuras, who was called Indrasatru, the enemy of Indra, was very
much aggrieved. Unable to tolerate such reverses, he stopped and
forcefully rebuked the demigods, speaking the following words in
an angry mood.

glorious: na—nor: svargyah—leading to the heavenly planets; sira-

maninam—of persons who consider themselves heroes.
TRANSLATION

O demigods, these demoniac soldiers have taken birth uselessly.
Indeed, they have come from the bodies of their mothers exactly
like stool. What is the benefit of killing such enemies from behind
while they are running in fear? One who considers himself a hero
should not kill an enemy who is afraid of losing his life. Such kill-
ing is never glorious, nor can it promote one to the heavenly
planets.

PURPORT

Vrtrasura rebuked both the demigods and the demoniac soldiers be-
cause the demons were running in fear of their lives and the demigods
were killing them from behind. The actions of both were abominable.
When a fight takes place, the opposing parties must be prepared to fight
like heroes. A hero never runs from the field of battle. He always fights
face to face, determined to gain victory or lay down his life in the fight.
That is heroic. Killing an enemy from behind is also inglorious. When an
enemy turns his back and runs in fear of his life, he should not be killed.
This is the etiquette of military science.

Vrtrasura insulted the demoniac soldiers by comparing them to the
stool of their mothers. Both stool and a cowardly son come from the
abdomen of the mother, and Vrtrasura said that there is no difference
between them. A similar comparison was given by Tulasi dasa, who com-
mented that a son and urine both come from the same channel. In other
words, semen and urine both come from the genitals, but semen pro-
duces a child whereas urine produces nothing. Therefore if a child is
neither a hero nor a devotee, he is not a son but urine. Similarly,
Canakya Pandita also says:

ko ’rthah putrena jatena
yo na vidvan na dharmikah
kanena caksusa kim va
caksuh pidaiva kevalam

“What is the use of a son who is neither glorious nor devoted to the
Lord? Such a son is like a blind eye, which simply gives pain but cannot
help one see.”

PURPORT
Rebuking the demigods, Vrtrasura challenged, “O demigods, if you
are actually heroes, stand before me now and try to show your prowess.
If you do not wish to fight. if you are afraid of losing your lives, I shall
not kill you, for unlike you, I am not so evil minded as to kill persons
who are neither heroic nor willing to fight. If you have faith in your
heroism, please stand before me.”

O King, when the great hero Vrtrasura saw Indra, his enemy,
the killer of his brother, standing before him with a thunderbolt
in his hand, desiring to fight, Vrtrasura remembered how Indra
had cruelly killed his brother. Thinking of Indra’s sinful ac-
tivities, he became mad with lamentation and forgetfulness.
Laughing sarcastically, he spoke as follows.

TRANSLATION

But if in this battle you cut off my head with your thunderbolt
and kill my soldiers, O Indra, O great hero, I shall take great
pleasure in offering my body to other living entities [such as
jackals and vultures]. I shall thus be relieved of my obligations to
the reactions of my karma, and my fortune will be to receive the
dust from the lotus feet of great devotees like Narada Muni.

PURPORT
Sri Narottama dasa Thakura sings:
ei chaya gosani yara, mui tara dasa
tan’ sabara pada-renu mora pafca-grasa

“I am the servant of the six Gosvamis, and the dust of their lotus feet
provides my five kinds of food.” A Vaisnava always desires the dust of
the lotus feet of previous acaryas and Vaisnavas. Vrtrasura was certain
that he would be killed in the battle with Indra, because this was the
desire of Lord Visnu. He was prepared for death because he knew that
after his death he was destined to return home, back to Godhead. This is
a great destination, and it is achieved by the grace of a Vaisnava.
Chadiya vaisnava-seva nistara payeche keba: no one has ever gone back
to Godhead without being favored by a Vaisnava. In this verse.
therefore, we find the words manasvinarh pada-rajah prapatsye: “I shall
receive the dust of the lotus feet of great devotees.” The word
manasvinam refers to great devotees who always think of Krsna. They
are always peaceful, thinking of Krsna, and therefore they are called
dhira. The best example of such a devotee is Narada Muni. If one
receives the dust of the lotus feet of a manaswvi, a great devotee, he cer-
tainly returns home, back to Godhead.

TRANSLATION
O King of the demigods, since I, your enemy, am standing
before you, why don’t you hurl your thunderbolt at me? Although
your attack upon me with your club was certainly useless, like a re-
quest of money from a miser, the thunderbolt you carry will not
be useless. You need have no doubts about this.
PURPORT
When King Indra threw his club at Vrtrasura, Vrtrasura caught it in
his left hand and retaliated by using it to strike the head of Indra’s
elephant. Thus Indra’s attack was a disastrous failure. Indeed, Indra’s
elephant was injured and thrown back fourteen yards. Therefore even
though Indra stood with the thunderbolt to hurl against Vrtrasura, he
was doubtful, thinking that the thunderbolt might also fail. Vrtrasura,
however, being a Vaisnava, assured Indra that the thunderbolt would not
fail, for Vrtrasura knew that it had been prepared in accordance with the


--- Page 208 ---
Text 20] The Transcendental Qualities of Vrtrasura 203
instructions of Lord Visnu. Although Indra had doubts because he could
not understand that Lord Visnu’s order never fails, Vrtrasura under-
stood Lord Visnu’s purpose. Vrtrasura was eager to be killed by the
thunderbolt manufactured according to Lord Visnu’s instructions be-
cause he was sure that he would thus return home, back to Godhead. He
was simply waiting for the opportunity of the thunderbolt’s being
released. In effect, therefore, Vrtrasura told Indra, “If you want to kill
me, since I am your enemy, take this opportunity. Kill me. You will gain
victory, and I shall go back to Godhead. Your deed will be equally
beneficial for both of us. Do it immediately.”

strength of Dadhici’s austerities. Since you have come here to kill

me in accordance with Lord Visnu’s order, there is no doubt that I
shall be killed by the release of your thunderbolt. Lord Visnu has
sided with you. Therefore your victory, opulence and all good
qualities are assured.
PURPORT
Vrtrasura not only assured King Indra that the thunderbolt was invin-
cible, but also encouraged Indra to use it against him as soon as possible.
Vrtrasura was eager to die with the stroke of the thunderbolt sent by
Lord Visnu so that he could immediately return home, back to Godhead.
By hurling the thunderbolt, Indra would gain victory and enjoy the
heavenly planets, remaining in the material world for repeated birth and
death. Indra wanted to gain victory over Vrtrasura and thereby become
happy, but that would not at all be happiness. The heavenly planets are
just below Brahmaloka, but as stated by the Supreme Lord, Krsna,
abrahma-bhuvanal lokah punar avartino ’rjuna: even if one achieves
Brahmaloka, he must still fall to the lower planetary systems again and
again. However, if one goes back to Godhead, he never returns to this
material world. By killing Vrtrasura, Indra would not actually gain; he
would remain in the material world. Vrtrasura, however, would go to the
spiritual world. Therefore victory was destined for Vrtrasura, not for
Indra.

By the force of your thunderbolt, I shall be freed of material
bondage and shall give up this body and this world of material
desires. Fixing my mind upon the lotus feet of Lord Sankarsana, I
shall attain the destination of such great sages as Narada Muni, just
as Lord Sankarsana has said.
PURPORT
The words aha samadhaya manah indicate that the most important
duty at the time of death is to concentrate one’s mind. If one can fix his
mind on the lotus feet of Krsna, Visnu, Sankarsana or any Visnu marti,
his life will be successful. To be killed while fixing his mind at the lotus
feet of Sankarsana, Vrtrasura asked Indra to release his vajra, or thun-
derbolt. He was destined to be killed by the thunderbolt given by Lord
Visnu; there was no question of its being baffled. Therefore Vrtrasura
requested Indra to release the thunderbolt immediately, and he prepared
himself by fixing his mind at the lotus feet of Krsna. A devotee is always
ready to give up his material body, which is described herein as gramya-
pasa, the rope of material attachment. The body is not at all good; it is
simply a cause of bondage to the material world. Unfortunately, even
though the body is destined for destruction, fools and rascals invest all
their faith in the body and are never eager to return home. back to
Godhead.

TRANSLATION
Persons who fully surrender at the lotus feet of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead and always think of His lotus feet are ac-
cepted and recognized by the Lord as His own personal assistants
or servants. The Lord never bestows upon such servants the
brilliant opulences of the upper, lower and middle planetary
systems of this material world. When one possesses material opu-
lence in any of these three divisions of the universe, his posses-
sions naturally increase his enmity, anxiety, mental agitation,
pride and belligerence. Thus one goes through much endeavor to
increase and maintain his possessions, and he suffers great
unhappiness when he loses them.
PURPORT
In Bhagavad-gita (4.11) the Lord says:

““As devotees surrender unto Me, I reward them accordingly. Everyone

Text 23] The Transcendental Qualities of Vrtrasura 207
Vrtrasura were certainly devotees of the Lord, although Indra took in-
structions from Visnu to kill Vrtrasura. The Lord was actually more
favorable to Vrtrasura because after being killed by Indra’s thunderbolt,
Vrtrasura would go back to Godhead, whereas the victorious Indra would
rot in this material world. Because both of them were devotees, the Lord
awarded them the respective benedictions they wanted. Vrtrasura never
wanted material possessions, for he knew very well the nature of such
possessions. To accumulate material possessions, one must labor very
hard, and when he gets them he creates many enemies because this ma-
terial world is always full of rivalry. If one becomes rich, his friends or
relatives are envious. For ekanta-bhaktas, unalloyed devotees, Krsna
therefore never provides material possessions. A devotee sometimes
needs some material possessions for preaching, but the possessions of a
preacher are not like those of a karmi. A karmi’s possessions are achieved
as a result of karma, but those of a devotee are arranged by the Supreme
Personality of Godhead just to facilitate his devotional activities. Because
a devotee never uses material possessions for any purpose other than the
service of the Lord, the possessions of a devotee are not to be compared to
those of a karmi.

the Supreme Personality of Godhead; yah—which; durlabhah—very

TRANSLATION

Our Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, forbids His
devotees to endeavor uselessly for religion, economic development
and sense gratification. 0 Indra, one can thus infer how kind the
Lord is. Such mercy is obtainable only by unalloyed devotees, not
by persons who aspire for material gains.

PURPORT

There are four objectives in human life—namely, religiosity
(dharma), economic development (artha), sense gratification (kama),
and liberation (moksa) from the bondage of material existence. People
generally aspire for religiosity, economic development and sense gra-
tification, but a devotee has no other desire than to serve the Supreme
Personality of Godhead both in this life and in the next. The special
mercy for the unalloyed devotee is that the Lord saves him from hard
labor to achieve the results of religion, economic development and sense
gratification. Of course, if one wants such benefits, the Lord certainly
awards them. Indra, for example, although a devotee, was not much in-
terested in release from material bondage; instead, he desired sense gra-
tification and a high standard of material happiness in the heavenly
planets. Vrtrasura, however, being an unalloyed devotee, aspired only to
serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the Lord arranged
for him to go back to Godhead after his bodily bondage was destroyed by
Indra. Vrtrasura requested Indra to release his thunderbolt against him
as soon as possible so that both he and Indra would benefit according to
their proportionate advancement in devotional service.

O my Lord, O Supreme Personality of Godhead, will I again be

at Your lotus feet? O Lord of my life, may I again become their
servant so that my mind may always think of Your transcendental
attributes, my words always glorify those attributes, and my body
always engage in the loving service of Your Lordship?
PURPORT
This verse gives the sum and substance of devotional life. One must
first become a servant of the servant of the servant of the Lord
(dasanudasa). Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu advised, and He also showed by
His own example, that a living entity should always desire to be a servant
of the servant of the servant of Krsna, the maintainer of the gopis (gopi-
bhartuh pada-kamalayor dasa-dasanudasah). This means that one must
accept a spiritual master who comes in the disciplic succession and is a
servant of the servant of the Lord. Under his direction, one must then
engage one’s three properties, namely his body, mind and words. The
body should be engaged in physical activity under the order of the


--- Page 215 ---
210 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 6, Ch. 11
master, the mind should think of Krsna incessantly, and one’s words
should be engaged in preaching the glories of the Lord. If one is thus
engaged in the loving service of the Lord, one’s life is successful.

ing transcendental loving service to the Lord. A pure devotee desires

only to engage in loving service to the Lord in the constant association of

(dasanudaso bhavitasmi). As confirmed by Narottama dasa Thakura:

To serve the Lord and the servants of His servants, in the association of
devotees, is the only objective of a pure, unalloyed devotee.

him to return and satisfy her in all respects, I always yearn for the
opportunity to render direct service unto You.
PURPORT
A pure devotee always yearns to associate personally with the Lord and
render service unto Him. The examples given in this regard are most ap-
propriate. A small baby bird is practically never satisfied except when
the mother bird comes to feed it, a small calf is not satisfied unless
allowed to suck the milk from the mother’s udder, and a chaste, devoted
wife whose husband is away from home is never satisfied until she has
the association of her beloved husband.

devotees. My attachment to my body, wife, children and home is

everything I have be attached only to You.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports to the Sixth Canto, Eleventh
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “The Transcendental
Qualities of Vrtrasura.”

CHAPTER TWELVE
Vrtrasura’s Glorious Death
This chapter describes how Indra, the King of heaven, killed Vrtrasura
despite great reluctance.

After Vrtrasura finished speaking, he released his trident against King
Indra with great anger, but Indra, using his thunderbolt, which was
many times more powerful than the trident, broke the trident to pieces
and cut off one of Vrtrasura’s arms. Nevertheless, Vrtrasura used his
remaining arm to strike Indra with an iron mace, making the thunder-
bolt fall from Indra’s hand. Indra, being very ashamed of this, did not
pick up the thunderbolt from the ground, but Vrtrasura encouraged
King Indra to pick it up and fight. Vrtrasura then spoke to King Indra as
follows, instructing him very well.

“The Supreme Personality of Godhead,” he said, “is the cause of vic-
tory and defeat. Not knowing that the Supreme Lord is the cause of all
causes, fools and rascals try to take credit for victory or defeat them-
selves, but everything is actually under the control of the Lord. No one
but Him has any independence. The purusa (the enjoyer) and prakrti
(the enjoyed) are under the control of the Lord, for it is by His supervi-
sion that everything works systematically. Not seeing the hand of the
Supreme in every action, a fool considers himself the ruler and controller
of everything. When one understands, however, that the real controller
is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is freed from the relativities
of the world, such as distress, happiness, fear and impurity.” Thus Indra
and Vrtrasura not only fought, but also engaged in philosophical dis-
courses. Then they began to fight again.

This time Indra was more powerful, and he severed Vrtrasura’s
remaining arm. Vrtrasura then assumed a gigantic form and swallowed
King Indra, but Indra, being protected by the talisman known as
Narayana-kavaca, was able to protect himself even within Vrtrasura’s
body. Thus he emerged from Vrtrasura’s abdomen and severed the
demon’s head from his body with his powerful thunderbolt. Severing the
demon’s head took one complete year to accomplish.

Sukadeva Gosvami said: Desiring to give up his body, Vrtrasura
considered death in the battle preferable to victory. O King
Pariksit, he vigorously took up his trident and with great force at-
tacked Lord Indra, the King of heaven, just as Kaitabha had
forcefully attacked the Supreme Personality of Godhead when the
universe was inundated.
PURPORT
Although Vrtrasura repeatedly encouraged Indra to kill him with the
thunderbolt, King Indra was morose at having to kill such a great devo-
tee and was hesitant to throw it. Vrtrasura, disappointed that King Indra


--- Page 221 ---
Text 2] Vrtrasura’s Glorious Death 217
was reluctant despite his encouragement, took the initiative very force-
fully by throwing his trident at Indra. Vrtrasura was not at all interested
in victory; he was interested in being killed so that he could immediately
return home, back to Godhead. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (4.9),
tyaktva dehariv punar janma naiti: after giving up his body, a devotee
immediately returns to Lord Krsna and never returns to accept another
body. This was Vrtrasura’s interest.

you!”

TRANSLATION
Vrtrasura continued: O Indra, no one is guaranteed of being al-
ways victorious but the original enjoyer, the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, Bhagavan. He is the cause of creation, maintenance
and annihilation, and He knows everything. Being dependent and
being obliged to accept material bodies, belligerent subordinates
are sometimes victorious and sometimes defeated.
PURPORT
The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (15.15):
sarvasya caharii hrdi sannivisto
mattah smrtir jiianam apohanar ca
“I am seated in everyone’s heart, and from Me come remembrance,
knowledge and forgetfulness.” When two parties fight, the fighting ac-
tually goes on under the direction of the Supreme Personality of God-
head, who is Paramatma, the Supersoul. Elsewhere in the Gita (3.27) the
Lord says:


--- Page 226 ---
222 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 6, Ch. 12
prakrteh kriyamanani
gunaih karmani sarvasah
ahankara-vimiadhatma
kartaham iti manyate
“The bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of
material nature, thinks himself the doer of activities that are in actuality
carried out by nature.” The living entities work only under the direction
of the Supreme Lord. The Lord gives orders to material nature, and she
arranges facilities for the living entities. The living entities are not inde-
pendent, although they foolishly think themselves the doers (karta).

Victory is always with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As for the
subordinate living entities, they fight under the arrangement of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Victory or defeat is not actually theirs;
it is an arrangement by the Lord through the agency of material nature.
Pride in victory, or moroseness in defeat, is useless. One should fully
depend on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is responsible for
the victory and defeat of all living entities. The Lord advises, niyatam
kuru karma tvarm karma jyayo hy akarmanah: ‘Perform your
prescribed duty, for action is better than inaction.” The living entity is
ordered to act according to his position. Victory or defeat depends on the
Supreme Lord. Karmany evadhikaras te ma phalesu kadacana: ‘You
have a right to perform your prescribed duty, but you are not entitled to
the fruits of actions.” One must act sincerely, according to his position.
Victory or defeat depends on the Lord.

Vrtrasura encouraged Indra, saying, “Don’t be morose because of my
victory. There is no need to stop fighting. Instead, you should go on with
your duty. When Krsna desires, you will certainly be victorious.” This
verse is very instructive for sincere workers in the Krsna consciousness
movement. We should not be jubilant in victory or morose in defeat. We
should make a sincere effort to implement the will of Krsna, or Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and we should not be concerned with victory and
defeat. Our only duty is to work sincerely, so that our activities may be
recognized by Krsna.

TRANSLATION
All living beings in all the planets of this universe, including the
presiding deities of all the planets, are fully under the control of
the Lord. They work like birds caught in a net, who cannot move
independently.
PURPORT
The difference between the suras and the asuras is that the suras know
that nothing can happen without the desire of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, whereas the asuras cannot understand the supreme will of
the Lord. In this fight, Vrtrasura is actually the sura, whereas Indra is
the asura. No one can act independently; rather, everyone acts under the
direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore victory and
defeat come according to the results of one’s karma, and the judgment is
given by the Supreme Lord (karmana daiva-netrena). Since we act
under the control of the Supreme according to our karma, no one is inde-
pendent, from Brahma down to the insignificant ant. Whether we are
defeated or victorious, the Supreme Lord is always victorious because
everyone acts under His directions.

dance according to the desire of the supreme controller, the Per-
sonality of Godhead. No one is independent.


--- Page 229 ---
Text 11] Vrtrasura’s Glorious Death 225
PURPORT
This is confirmed in Caitanya-caritamrta (Adi 5.142):
ekale vara krsna, ara saba bhrtya

“Lord Krsna alone is the supreme controller, and all others are His ser-
vants. They dance as He makes them do so.” We are all servants of
Krsna; we have no independence. We are dancing according to the desire
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but out of ignorance and illusion
we think we are independent of the supreme will. Therefore it is said:
ष्व, paramah krsnah
sac-cid-ananda-vigrahah
anadir adir govindah
sarva-karana-karanam
“Krsna, who is known as Govinda, is the supreme controller. He has an
eternal, blissful, spiritual body. He is the origin of all. He has no other
origin, for He is the prime cause of all causes.” (Brahma-sarihita 5.1)

The three purusas—Karanodakasayi Visnu, Garbhodakasayi
Visnu and KsirodakaSayi Visnu—the material nature, the total ma-
terial energy, the false ego, the five material elements, the material
senses, the mind, the intelligence and consciousness cannot create
the material manifestation without the direction of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead.

PURPORT

As confirmed in the Visnu Purana, parasya brahmanah Saktis
tathedam akhilarih jagat: whatever manifestations we experience are
nothing but various energies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
These energies cannot create anything independently. This is also con-
firmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gita (9.10): mayadhyaksena
prakrtih sityate sa-caracaram. “This material nature is working under
My direction, O son of Kunti, and it is producing all moving and unmov-
ing living beings.” Only under the direction of the Lord, the Supreme
Person, can prakrti, which is manifested in twenty-four elements, create
different situations for the living entity. In the Vedas the Lord says:

madiyarih mahimanar ca
parabrahmeti sabditam
vetsyasy anugrhitarih me
samprasnair vivrtarn hrdi

“Since everything is a manifestation of My energy, I am known as
Parabrahman. Therefore everyone should hear from Me about My
glorious activities.” The Lord also says in Bhagavad-gita (10.2), aham
adir hi devanam: “I am the origin of all the demigods.” Therefore the
Supreme Personality of Godhead is the origin of everything, and no one
is independent of Him. Srila Madhvacarya also says, anisa-jiva-rapena:
the living entity is ania, never the controller, but is always controlled.
Therefore when a living entity becomes proud of being an independent


--- Page 231 ---
Text 12] Vrtrasura’s Glorious Death 227
vara, or god, that is his foolishness. Such foolishness is described in the
following verse.

avidvan—one who is foolish, without knowledge; evam—thus: at-

dependent on others; Svaram—as the supreme controller, independent:
bhitaih—by the living entities; srjati—He (the Lord) creates; bhitani—
other living entities; grasate—He devours; tani—them; taih—by other
living beings: svayam —Himself.

TRANSLATION

A foolish, senseless person cannot understand the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead. Although always dependent, he falsely thinks
himself the Supreme. If one thinks, ‘According to one’s previous
fruitive actions, one’s material body is created by the father and
mother, and the same body is annihilated by another agent, as
another animal is devoured by a tiger,” this is not proper under-
standing. The Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself creates
and devours the living beings through other living beings.

PURPORT

According to the conclusion of the philosophy known as karma-
mimdrisa, one’s karma, or previous fruitive activity, is the cause of
everything, and therefore there is no need to work. Those who arrive at
this conclusion are foolish. When a father creates a child, he does not do
so independently; he is induced to do so by the Supreme Lord. As the


--- Page 232 ---
228 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 6, Ch. 12
Lord Himself says in Bhagavad-gita (15.15), sarvasya caham hrdi san-
nivisto mattah smrtir jianam apohanar ca: “I am in everyone’s heart,
and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness.” Unless
one receives dictation from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who
sits within everyone’s heart, one cannot be induced to create anything.
Therefore the father and mother are not the creators of the living entity.
According to the living entity’s karma, fruitive activities, he is put into
the semen of the father, who injects the living entity into the womb of
the mother. Then according to the body of the mother and father (yatha-
yoni yatha-bijam), the living entity accepts a body and takes birth to
suffer or enjoy. Therefore the Supreme Lord is the original cause of
one’s birth. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is the cause of one’s being
killed. No one is independent; everyone is dependent. The true conclu-
sion is that the only independent person is the Supreme Personality of
Godhead.

Just as a person not inclined to die must nonetheless give up his

so, at the appointed time of victory, one can gain all these when the
Supreme Lord awards them by His mercy.


--- Page 233 ---
Text 14] Vrtrasura’s Glorious Death 229
PURPORT

It is not good to be falsely puffed up, saying that by one’s own effort
one has become opulent, learned, beautiful and so on. All such good for-
tune is achieved through the mercy of the Lord. From another point of
view, no one wants to die, and no one wants to be poor or ugly.
Therefore, why does the living entity, against his will, receive such un-
wanted troubles? It is due to the mercy or chastisement of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead that one gains or loses everything material. No
one is independent; everyone is dependent on the mercy or chastisement
of the Supreme Lord. There is a common saying in Bengal that the Lord
has ten hands. This means that He has control everywhere —in the eight
directions and up and down. If He wants to take everything away from us
with His ten hands, we cannot protect anything with our two hands.
Similarly, if He wants to bestow benedictions upon us with His ten
hands, we cannot factually receive them all with our two hands; in other
words, the benedictions exceed our ambitions. The conclusion is that
even though we do not wish to be separated from our possessions, some-
times the Lord forcibly takes them from us; and sometimes He showers
such benedictions upon us that we are unable to receive them all.
Therefore either in opulence or in distress we are not independent;
everything is dependent on the sweet will of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead.

Since everything is dependent on the supreme will of the Per-
sonality of Godhead, one should be equipoised in fame and
defamation, victory and defeat, life and death. In their effects,
represented as happiness and distress, one should maintain oneself
in equilibrium, without anxiety.

TRANSLATION
One who knows that the three qualities — goodness, passion and
ignorance —are not qualities of the soul but qualities of material
nature, and who knows that the pure soul is simply an observer of
the actions and reactions of these qualities, should be understood
to be a liberated person. He is not bound by these qualities.
PURPORT
As the Lord explains in Bhagavad-gita (18.54):

Text 16] Vrtrasura’s Glorious Death 231
brahma-bhiitah prasannatma
na Socati na kanksati

mad-bhaktirh labhate param
“One who is transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme
Brahman and becomes fully joyful. He never laments or desires to have
anything; he is equally disposed to every living entity. In that state he at-
tains pure devotional service unto Me.” When one attains self-realiza-
tion, the brahma-bhiita stage, one knows that whatever happens during
his life is due to the contamination of the modes of material nature. The
living being, the pure soul, has nothing to do with these modes. In the
midst of the hurricane of the material world, everything changes very
quickly, but if one remains silent and simply observes the actions and
reactions of the hurricane, he is understood to be liberated. The real
qualification of the liberated soul is that he remains Krsna conscious, un-
disturbed by the actions and reactions of the material energy. Such a
liberated person is always jubilant. He never laments or aspires for any-
thing. Since everything is supplied by the Supreme Lord, the living en-
tity, being fully dependent on Him, should not protest or accept anything
in terms of his personal sense gratification; rather, he should re-
ceive everything as the mercy of the Lord and remain steady in all
circumstances.

TRANSLATION

O my enemy, just look at me. I have already been defeated, for
my weapon and arm have been cut to pieces. You have already
overwhelmed me, but nonetheless, with a desire to kill you, I am
trying my best to fight. I am not at all morose, even under such ad-
verse conditions. Therefore you should give up your moroseness
and continue fighting.

PURPORT

Vrtrasura was so great and powerful that in effect he was acting as the
spiritual master of Indra. Although Vrtrasura was on the verge of defeat,
he was not at all affected. He knew that he was going to be defeated by
Indra, and he voluntarily accepted that, but since he was supposed to be
Indra’s enemy, he tried his best to kill Indra. Thus he performed his
duty. One should perform his duty under all circumstances, even though
one may know what the result will be.

Sukadeva Gosvami said: Hearing the straightforward, instruc-
tive words of Vrtrasura, King Indra praised him and again took the
thunderbolt in his hand. Without bewilderment or duplicity, he
then smiled and spoke to Vrtrasura as follows.
PURPORT
King Indra, the greatest of the demigods, was astonished to hear the
instructions of Vrtrasura, who was supposed to be a demon. He was
struck with wonder that a demon could speak so intelligently. Then he
remembered great devotees like Prahlada Maharaja and Bali Maharaja,
who had been born in the families of demons, and thus he came to his

senses. Even so-called demons sometimes have exalted devotion for the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore Indra smiled reassuringly at
Vrtrasura.

in such a position, one is never shaken, even in the midst of the greatest
difficulty.” An unalloyed devotee is never disturbed by any kind of
trying circumstance. Indra was surprised to see that Vrtrasura, un-
disturbed, was fixed in devotional service to the Lord, for such a men-
tality is impossible for a demon. However, by the grace of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, anyone can become an exalted devotee (striyo
vaisyas tatha $udrds te ‘pi yanti pararh gatim). An unalloyed devotee is
sure to return home, back to Godhead.

TRANSLATION

You have surmounted the illusory energy of Lord Visnu, and
because of this liberation, you have given up the demoniac men-
tality and have attained the position of an exalted devotee.

PURPORT

Lord Visnu is the maha-purusa. Therefore one who becomes a
Vaisnava attains the position of a maha-paurusya. This position was at-
tained by Maharaja Pariksit. It is said in the Padma Purana that the dis-
tinction between a demigod and a demon is that a demigod is a devotee of
Lord Visnu whereas a demon is just the opposite: visnu-bhaktah smrto


--- Page 240 ---
236 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 6, Ch. 12
daiva asuras tad-viparyayah. Vrtrasura was considered a demon, but ac-
tually he was more than qualified as a devotee, or maha-paurusya. If one
somehow becomes a devotee of the Supreme Lord, whatever his position,
he can be brought to the position of a perfect person. This is possible if
an unalloyed devotee tries to serve the Lord by delivering him in this
way. Therefore Sukadeva Gosvimi says in Srimad-Bhagavatam
(2.4.18):

kirata-hanandhra-pulinda-pulkasa

abhira-sumbha yavanah khasadayah
ye ‘nye ca papa yad-apdsrayasrayah
Sudhyanti tasmai prabhavisnave namah
“Kiratas, Hanas, Andhras, Pulindas, Pulkasas, Abbhiras, Sumbhas,
Yavanas and members of the Khasa races, and even others addicted to
sinful acts can be purified by taking shelter of the devotees of the Lord,
for He is the supreme power. I beg to offer my respectful obeisances unto
Him.” Anyone can be purified if he takes shelter of a pure devotee and
molds his character according to the pure devotee’s direction. Then, even
if one is a Kirata, Andhra, Pulinda or whatever, he can be purified and
elevated to the position of a maha-paurusya.

TRANSLATION
O Vrtrasura, demons are generally conducted by the mode of
passion. Therefore, what a great wonder it is that although you are
a demon, you have adopted the mentality of a devotee and have
fixed your mind on the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Vasudeva, who is always situated in pure goodness.
PURPORT
King Indra wondered how Vrtrasura could have been elevated to the
position of an exalted devotee. As for Prahlada Maharaja, he was ini-
tiated by Narada Muni, and therefore it was possible for him to become a
great devotee, although he was born in a family of demons. For
Vrtrasura, however, Indra could not detect such causes. Therefore he
was struck with wonder that Vrtrasura was such an exalted devotee that
he could fix his mind without deviation upon the lotus feet of Lord
Krsna, Vasudeva.

--- Page 242 ---
238 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 6, Ch. 12

PURPORT

Vrtrasura has formerly prayed (Bhag. 6.11.25), na naka-prsthari na

ca paramesthyari na sarva-bhaumar na rasadhipatyam. “I do not want
the facilities for happiness on Brahmaloka, Svargaloka or even
Dhruvaloka, not to speak of this earth or the lower planets. I simply want
to return home, back to Godhead.” This is the determination of a pure
devotee. A pure devotee is never attracted to any exalted position within
this material world. He simply wants to associate with the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead like the inhabitants of Vrndavana—Srimati
Radharani, the gopis, Krsna’s father and mother (Nanda Maharaja and
Yasoda), Krsna’s friends and Krsna’s servants. He wants to associate with
Krsna’s atmosphere of Vrndavana’s beauty. These are the highest ambi-
tions of a devotee of Krsna. Devotees of Lord Visnu may aspire for a
position in Vaikunthaloka, but a devotee of Krsna never aspires even for
the facilities of Vaikuntha; he wants to return to Goloka Vrndavana and
associate with Lord Krsna in His eternal pastimes. Any material happi-
ness is like water in a ditch, whereas the spiritual happiness eternally en-
joyed in the spiritual world is like an ocean of nectar in which a devotee
wants to swim.

dra. Vrtrasura’s huge body resembled such a mountain.

He placed his lower jaw on the ground and his upper jaw in the
sky. His mouth became very deep, like the sky itself, and his
tongue resembled a large serpent. With his fearful, deathlike
teeth, he seemed to be trying to devour the entire universe. Thus
assuming a gigantic body, the great demon Vrtrasura shook even
the mountains and began crushing the surface of the earth with
his legs, as if he were the Himalayas walking about. He came
before Indra and swallowed him and Airavata, his carrier, just as a
big python might swallow an elephant.

Vrtrasura, was actually killed. He says that when Vrtrasura swallowed
King Indra and his carrier, the elephant, he thought, “Now I have killed
Indra, and therefore there is no more need of fighting. Now let me
return home, back to Godhead.” Thus he stopped all his bodily activities
and became situated in trance. Taking advantage of the silence of
Vrirasura’s body, Indra pierced the demon’s abdomen, and because of
Vrtrasura’s trance, Indra was able to come out. Now, Vrtrasura was in
yoga-samadhi, and therefore although King Indra wanted to cut his
throat, the demon’s neck was so stiff that Indra’s thunderbolt took 360
days to cut it to pieces. Actually it was the body left by Vrtrasura that was
cut to pieces by Indra; Vrtrasura himself was not killed. In his original
consciousness, Vrtrasura returned home, back to Godhead, to become an
associate of Lord Sankarsana. Here the word alokam means the transcen-
dental world, Vaikunthaloka, where Sarnkarsana eternally resides.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Sixth Canto, Twelfth
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled ‘“‘Vrtrasura’s Glorious
Death.”

6 CHAPTER THIRTEEN
King Indra
Afflicted by Sinful Reaction
This chapter describes Indra’s fear at having killed a brahmana
(Vrtrasura), and it also describes how he fled and was saved by the grace
of Lord Visnu.

When all the demigods requested Indra to kill Vrtrasura, he refused
because Vrtrasura was a brahmana. The demigods, however, encouraged
Indra not to fear killing him because Indra was protected by the
Narayana-kavaca, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, Lord
Narayana. Even by a glimpse of the chanting of Narayana’s name, one
becomes free from all the sinful reactions of killing a woman, a cow or a
brahmana. The demigods advised Indra to perform an asvamedha
sacrifice, by which Narayana would be pleased, for the performer of such
a sacrifice is not implicated in sinful reactions even if he kills the entire
universe.

Following this instruction from the demigods, King Indra fought
Vrtrasura, but when Vrtrasura was killed, everyone was satisfied but
King Indra, who knew Vrtrasura’s position. This is the nature of a great
personality. Even if a great personality acquires some opulence, he is al-
ways ashamed and regretful if he acquires it illegally. Indra could under-
stand that he was certainly entangled by sinful reactions for killing a
brahmana. Indeed, he could see sinful reaction personified following
him, and thus he fled here and there in fear, thinking of how to rid
himself of his sins. He went to Minasa-sarovara, and there, under the
protection of the goddess of fortune, he meditated for one thousand
years. During this time, Nahusa reigned over the heavenly planets as
the representative of Indra. Unfortunately, however, he was attracted by
the beauty of Indra’s wife, Sacidevi, and because of his sinful desire he
had to accept the body of a serpent in his next life. Indra later performed
a great sacrifice with the help of exalted brahmanas and saints. In this
way he was released from the reactions of his sinful killing of a
brahmana.

departing, however, no one spoke to Indra.

In this connection Srila Viévanatha Cakravarti Thakura comments:

Lord Brahma, Lord Siva and the other demigods returned to their re-
spective abodes, but Indra did not, for he was disturbed at having killed
Vrtrasura, who was actually a brahmana. After killing Vrtrasura, Indra
went to the Manasa-sarovara Lake to become free from sinful reactions.
When he left the lake, he performed an asvamedha-yajiia and then
returned to his own abode.

sri-raja uvaca—King Pariksit inquired; indrasya—of King Indra;
anirvrteh—of the moroseness; hetum —the reason; $rotum —to hear; ic-
chami—] wish: bhoh—O my lord; mune—O great sage, Sukadeva

TRANSLATION

Maharaja Pariksit inquired from Sukadeva Gosvami: 0 great
sage, what was the reason for Indra’s unhappiness? I wish to hear
about this. When he killed Vrtrasura, all the demigods were ex-
tremely happy. Why, then, was Indra himself unhappy?

PURPORT

This, of course, is a very intelligent question. When a demon is killed,
certainly all the demigods are happy. In this case, however, when all the
demigods were happy because of Vrtrasura’s having been killed, Indra
was unhappy. Why? It may be suggested that Indra was unhappy be-
cause he knew that he had killed a great devotee and brahmana.
Vrtrasura outwardly appeared to be a demon, but inwardly he was a
great devotee and therefore a great brahmana.

Herein it is clearly indicated that a person who is not at all demoniac,
such as Prahlada Maharaja and Bali Maharaja, may outwardly be a
demon or be born in a family of demons. Therefore in terms of real
culture one should not be considered a demigod or demon simply accord-
ing to birth. In his dealings while fighting with Indra, Vrtrasura proved
himself a great devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Further-
more. as soon as he finished fighting with Indra and was apparently
killed, Vrtrasura was transferred to Vaikunthaloka to become an asso-
ciate of Sankarsana. Indra knew this, and therefore he was morose at
having killed such a demon, who was actually a Vaisnava or brahmana.

A Vaisnava is already a brahmana, although a brahmana may not be a
Vaisnava. The Padma Purana says:

sat-karma-nipuno vipro )
mantra-tantra-visaradah


--- Page 255 ---
Text 4] Indra Afflicted by Sinful Reaction 251

avaisnavo gurur na syad

vaisnavah sva-paco guruh
One may be a brahmana in terms of his culture and family and may be
expert in Vedic knowledge (mantra-tantra-visaradah), but if he is not a
Vaisnava, he cannot be a guru. This means that an expert brahmana may
not be a Vaisnava, but a Vaisnava is already a brahmana. A millionaire
may very easily possess hundreds and thousands of dollars, but a person
with hundreds and thousands of dollars is not necessarily a millionaire.
Vrtrasura was a perfect Vaisnava, and therefore he was also a brahmana.

mediately freed from all sinful reactions simply by chanting the
holy name of Lord Narayana. Other sinful persons, such as dog-
eaters and candalas, who are less than §idras, can also be freed in
this way. But you are a devotee, and we shall help you by perform-
ing the great horse sacrifice. If you please Lord Narayana in that
way, why should you be afraid? You will be freed even if you kill
the entire universe, including the brahmanas, not to speak of kill-
ing a disturbing demon like Vrtrasura.
PURPORT
It is said in the Brhad-visnu Purana:
namno hi yavati saktih
papa-nirharane hareh
tavat karturih na saknoti
patakarin pataki narah
Also, in the Prema-vivarta by Jagadananda Pandita it is said:
eka krsna-name papira yata papa-ksaya
bahu janme sei papi karite naraya
This means that by once chanting the holy name of the Lord, one can be
freed from the reactions of more sins that he can even imagine perform-
ing. The holy name is so spiritually potent that simply by chanting the
holy name one can be freed from the reactions to all sinful activities.
What, then, is to be said of those who chant the holy name regularly or
worship the Deity regularly? For such purified devotees, freedom from
sinful reaction is certainly assured. This does not mean, however, that
one should intentionally commit sinful acts and think himself free from
the reactions because he is chanting the holy name. Such a mentality is a
most abominable offense at the lotus feet of the holy name. Namno balad
yasya hi papa-buddhih: the Lord’s holy name certainly has the potency
to neutralize all sinful activities, but if one repeatedly and intentionally
commits sins while chanting the holy name, he is most condemned.
These verses name the performers of various sinful deeds. In the
Manu-sarihita the following names are given. A son begotten by a


--- Page 260 ---
256 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 6, Ch. 13
brahmana and born from the womb of a Sidra mother is called a
parasava or nisada, a hunter accustomed to stealing. A son begotten by a
nisada in the womb of a Sidra woman is called a pukkasa. A child begot-
ten by a ksatriya in the womb of the daughter of a Sidra is called an
ugra. A child begotten by a Sidra in the womb of the daughter of a
ksatriya is called a ksatta. A child begotten by a ksatriya in the womb of a
lower-class woman 15 called a $vada, or dog-eater. All such offspring are
considered extremely sinful, but the holy name of the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead is so strong that all of them can be purified simply by
chanting the Hare Krsna mantra.

The Hare Krsna movement offers everyone a chance to be purified,
regardless of birth or family. As confirmed in Srimad-Bhdgavatam
(2.4.18):

kirata-hianandhra-pulinda-pulkasa
abhira-Sumbha yavanah khasadayah
ye ११९ ca papa yad-apasrayasrayah
Sudhyanti tasmai prabhavisnave namah
“Kiratas, Hanas, Andhras, Pulindas, Pulkasas, Abhiras, Sumbhas,
Yavanas, members of the Khasa races, and even others addicted to sinful
acts can be purified by taking shelter of devotees of the Lord, for He is
the supreme power. I beg to offer my respectful obeisances unto Him.”
Even such sinful persons can certainly all be purified if they chant the
holy name of the Lord under the direction of a pure devotee.

Herein the sages encourage King Indra to kill Vrtrasura even at the
risk of brahma-hatya, the killing of a brahmana, and they guarantee to
release him from sinful reactions by performing an asvamedha-yajiia.
Such purposefully devised atonement, however, cannot relieve the per-
former of sinful acts. This will be seen from the following verse.

hatya—the sinful reaction for killing a brahmana; hate—was killed;
tasmin—when he (Vrtrasura); asasada —approached; vrsakapim—In-
dra, who is also named Vrsakapi.

TRANSLATION

Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said: Encouraged by the words of the
sages, Indra killed Vrtrasura, and when he was killed the sinful
reaction for killing a brahmana [brahma-hatya] certainly took
shelter of Indra.

PURPORT

After killing Vrtrasura, Indra could not surpass the brahma-hatya,
the sinful reactions for killing a brahmana. Formerly he had killed one
brahmana, Viévaripa, out of circumstantial anger, but this time, follow-
ing the advice of the sages, he killed another brahmana purposely.
Therefore the sinful reaction was greater than before. Indra could not be
relieved from the reaction simply by performing sacrifices for atone-
ment. He had to undergo a severe series of sinful reactions, and when he
was freed by such suffering, the brahmanas allowed him to perform the
horse sacrifice. The planned execution of sinful deeds on the strength of
chanting the holy name of the Lord or undergoing prayascitta, atone-
ment, cannot give relief to anyone, even to Indra or Nahusa. Nahusa was
officiating for Indra while Indra, absent from heaven, was going here
and there to gain release from his sinful reactions.

TRANSLATION
Following the advice of the demigods, Indra killed Vrtrasura,
and he suffered because of this sinful killing. Although the other
demigods were happy, he could not derive happiness from the
killing of Vrtrasura. Indra’s other good qualities, such as tolerance
and opulence, could not help him in his grief.
PURPORT
One cannot be happy by committing sinful acts, even if one is endowed
with material opulence. Indra found this to be true. People began to
blaspheme him, saying, “This person has killed a brahmana for the sake
of enjoying heavenly material happiness.” Therefore in spite of being
King of heaven and enjoying material opulence, Indra was always
unhappy because of the accusations of the populace.

Always thinking of how he could be relieved from the sinful
reaction for killing a brahmana, King Indra, invisible to everyone,
lived in the lake for one thousand years in the subtle fibers of the
stem of a lotus. The fire-god used to bring him his share of all
yajiias, but because the fire-god was afraid to enter the water,
Indra was practically starving. .

As long as King Indra lived in the water, wrapped in the stem of
the lotus, Nahusa was equipped with the ability to rule the
heavenly kingdom, due to his knowledge, austerity and mystic
power. Nahusa, however, blinded and maddened by power and
opulence, made undesirable proposals to Indra’s wife with a desire
to enjoy her. Thus Nahusa was cursed by a brahmana and later
became a snake.

TRANSLATION
Indra’s sins were diminished by the influence of Rudra, the
demigod of all directions. Because Indra was protected by the god-
dess of fortune, Lord Visnu’s wife, who resides in the lotus
clusters of Manasa-sarovara Lake, Indra’s sins could not affect him.
Indra was ultimately relieved of all the reactions of his sinful deeds
by strictly worshiping Lord Visnu. Then he was called back to the
heavenly planets by the brahmanas and reinstated in his position.

TRANSLATION

In this very great narrative there is glorification of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Narayana, there are statements about the
exaltedness of devotional service, there are descriptions of devo-
tees like Indra and Vrtrasura, and there are statements about King
Indra’s release from sinful life and about his victory in fighting
the demons. By understanding this incident, one is relieved of all
sinful reactions. Therefore the learned are always advised to read
this narration. If one does so, one will become expert in the ac-
tivities of the senses, his opulence will increase, and his reputation
will become widespread. One will also be relieved of all sinful reac-
tions, he will conquer all his enemies, and the duration of his life
will increase. Because this narration is auspicious in all respects,
learned scholars regularly hear and repeat it on every festival day.

Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Sixth Canto, Thirteenth
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “King Indra Afflicted by
Sinful Reaction.”

The Author

His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada appeared in
this world in 1896 in Calcutta. India. He first met his spiritual master.
Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami, in Calcutta in 1922. Bhakti-
siddhanta Sarasvati, a prominent devotional scholar and the founder of
sixty-four Gaudiya Mathas (Vedic Institutes). liked this educated young
man and convinced him to dedicate his life to teaching Vedic knowledge.
Srila Prabhupada became his student, and eleven years later (1933) at
Allahabad he became his formally initiated disciple.

At their first meeting, in 1922. Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati
Thakura requested Srila Prabhupada to broadcast Vedic knowledge
through the English language. In the years that followed. Srila
Prabhupada wrote a commentary on the Bhagavad-gita, assisted the
Gaudiya Matha in its work and, in 1944, without assistance, started an
English fortnightly magazine, edited it, typed the manuscripts and
checked the galley proofs. He even distributed the individual copies
freely and struggled to maintain the publication. Once begun. the maga-
zine never stopped; it is now being continued by his disciples in the
West. ५

Recognizing Srila Prabhupada’s philosophical learning and devotion.
the Gaudiya Vaisnava Society honored him in 1947 with the title
“‘Bhaktivedanta.”” In 1950. at the age of fifty-four. Srila Prabhupada
retired from married life. and four years later he adopted the
vanaprastha (retired) order to devote more time to his studies and writ-
ing. Srila Prabhupada traveled to the holy city of Vrndavana, where he
lived in very humble circumstances in the historic medieval temple of
Radha-Damodara. There he engaged for several years in deep study and
writing. He accepted the renounced order of life (sannyasa) in 1959. At
Radha-Damodara, Srila Prabhupada began work on his life's master-
piece: a multivolume translation and commentary on the eighteen thou-
sand verse Srimad-Bhagavatam (Bhagavata Purana). He also wrote
Easy Journey to Other Planets.

After publishing three volumes of Bhagavatam, Srila Prabhupada
came to the United States, in 1965, to fulfill the mission of his spiritual
master. Since that time, His Divine Grace has written over forty volumes
of authoritative translations, commentaries and summary studies of the
philosophical and religious classics of India.

270 Srimad-Bhagavatam

In 1965. when he first arrived by freighter in New York City. Srila
Prabhupada was practically penniless. It was after almost a year of great
difficulty that he established the International Society for Krishna Con-
sciousness in July of 1966. Under his careful guidance. the Society has
grown within a decade to a worldwide confederation of almost one
hundred asramas, schools. temples. institutes and farm communities.

In 1968. Srila Prabhupada created New Vrndavana. an experimental
Vedic community in the hills of West Virginia. Inspired by the success of
New Vrndavana. now a thriving farm community of more than one thou-
sand acres, his students have since founded several similar communities
in the United States and abroad.

In 1972, His Divine Grace introduced the Vedic system of primary and
secondary education in the West by founding the Gurukula school in
Dallas, Texas. The school began with 3 children in 1972, and by the
beginning of 1975 the enrollment had grown to 150.

Srila Prabhupada has also inspired the construction of a large interna-
tional center at Sridhama Mayapur in West Bengal. India. which is also
the site for a planned Institute of Vedic Studies. A similar project is the
magnificent Krsna-Balarama Temple and International Guest House in
Vrndavana. India. These are centers where Westerners can live to gain
firsthand experience of Vedic culture.

Srila Prabhupada’s most significant contribution. however. is his
books. Highly respected by the academic community for their
authoritativeness. depth and clarity. they are used as standard textbooks
in numerous college courses. His writings have been translated into
eleven languages. The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust. established in 1972
exclusively to publish the works of His Divine Grace. has thus become
the world’s largest publisher of books in the field of Indian religion and
philosophy. Its latest project is the publishing of Srila Prabhupada’s most
recent work: a seventeen-volume translation and commentary —com-
pleted by Srila Prabhupada in only eighteen months—on the Bengali
religious classic Sri Caitanya-caritamrta.

In the past ten years. in spite of his advanced age. Srila Prabhupada
has circled the globe twelve times on lecture tours that have taken him to
six continents. In spite of such a vigorous schedule. Srila Prabhupada
continues to write prolifically. His writings constitute a veritable library
of Vedic philosophy. religion. literature and culture.

GENEALOGICAL TABLE-CHART ONE
The Plenary Expansions of Godhead and Descendants of Brahma up to the Sons and Daughters of Daksa
KRSNA Krsna is the source of all forms of Godhead as well as all living entities. His first expansion is Balarama. The first part
"ध of this simplified chart portrays the different expansions of Lord Krsna through the Purusa avatdras, or expansions for
| material creation, such as Maha-Visnu. From the second Purusa avatdra, Garbhodakagayi Visnu, is born Lord Brahma,
Balarama the first created personality within the material world. Brahma is the empowered creator of the manifested universe
| and everything within it. The second part of this chart depicts Brahma’s descendants as far as the sons and daughters of
5 Daksa. .
Sakarsana The daughters of Daksa and their descendants are shown in the second chart (pp. 282-283 following). As described
~ | in this volume, Prajapati Daksa begot sixty daughters in the womb of his wife Asikni. One should know that it is be-
Mahs-Sarikarsana cause of the union of these sixty daughters with various exalted personalities that the entire universe was filled with
| various kinds of living entities, such as human beings, demigods, demons, beasts, birds and serpents.
Maha-Visnu Lord Brahma and subsequent personalities in these charts are jivas, or ordinary living entities, except as noted. All
| expansions from Krsna to Garbhodakaayi Visnu are infinite forms of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Krsna.
