CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE
The Glories of Devotional Service

Saunaka uvdca

$aunakah uvaca—Sri Saunaka said; kapilah— Lord Kapila; tattva—of the
truth; sankhyati—the expounder; bhagavan—the Supreme Personality of
Godhead; atma-mayaya—by His internal potency; jatah—took birth;
svayam— Himself; ajah—unborn; saksat—in person; atma-prajiaptaye—to
disseminate transcendental knowledge; nrram—for the human race.

TRANSLATION

Sri Saunaka said: Although He is unborn, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead took birth as Kapila Muni by His internal potency. He descended
to disseminate transcendental knowledge for the benefit of the whole
human race.

PURPORT

The word dtma-prajiiaptaye indicates that the Lord descends for the
benefit of the human race to give transcendental knowledge. Material
necessities are quite sufficiently provided for in the Vedic knowledge,
which offers a program for good living conditions and gradual elevation to

1001


--- Page 2 ---
1002 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 25
the platform of goodness. In the mode of goodness one’s knowledge ex-
pands. On the platform of passion there is no knowledge, for passion is
simply an impetus to enjoy material benefits. On the platform of ignorance
there is no knowledge and no enjoyment but simply life almost like that of
animals.

The Vedas are meant to elevate one from the mode of ignorance to the
platform of goodness. When one is situated in the mode of goodness he is
able to understand knowledge of the self, or transcendental knowledge.
This knowledge cannot be appreciated by any ordinary man. Therefore,
since a disciplic succession is required, this knowledge is expounded either
by the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself or by His bona fide
devotee. Saunaka Muni also states here that Kapila, the incarnation of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, took His birth or appearance simply to
appreciate and disseminate transcendental knowledge. Simply to under-
stand that one is not matter but spirit soul (ahart brahmdsmi: “1 am by
nature Brahman’) is not sufficient knowledge for understanding the self
and his activities. One must be situated in the activities of Brahman, and
that knowledge is explained by the Supreme Personality of Godhead
Himself. Such transcendental knowledge can be appreciated in human
society but not in animal society, as clearly indicated here by the word
nrpam, “for the human beings.” Human beings are meant for regulated life.
By nature, there is regulation in animal life also, but that is not like the
regulative life as described in the scriptures or by the authorities. Human
life is regulated life, not animal life. In regulated life only can one under-
stand transcendental knowledge.

visrutau—in hearing; $ruta-devasya—the master of the Vedas; bhiiri—
repeatedly; trpyanti—are sated; me—my; asavah—senses.

TRANSLATION

Saunaka continued: There is no one who knows more than the Lord
Himself. No one is more worshipable or more mature a yogi than He.
He is therefore the master of the Vedas, and to hear about Him always is
the actual pleasure of the senses.

PURPORT

In Bhagavad-gita it is stated that no one can be equal to or greater than
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is confirmed in the Vedas also:
eko bahiinam yo vidadhdti kamdn. He is the supreme living entity and is
supplying the necessities of all other living entities. Thus all other living
entities, both visnu-tattva and jiva-tattva, are subordinate to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Krsna. The same concept is confirmed here. Na hy
asya vargsmanah purisam: amongst the living entities, no one can surpass the
Supreme Person because no one is richer, more famous, stronger, more
beautiful, wiser or more renounced than He. These qualifications make
Him the Supreme Godhead, the cause of all causes. Yogis are very proud
of performing wonderful feats, but no one can compare to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead.

Anyone who is associated with the Supreme Lord is accepted as a first-
class yogi. Devotees may not be as powerful as the Supreme Lord, but by
constant association with the Lord they become as good as the Lord Him-
self. Sometimes the devotees act more powerfully than the Lord. Of
course, that is the Lord’s concession.

Also used here is the word varimpah, the most worshipful of all yogis.
To hear from Krsna is the real pleasure of the senses; therefore He isknown
as Govinda, for by His words, by His teachings, by His instruction—by
everything connected with Him—He enlivens the senses. Whatever He
instructs is from the transcendental platform, and His instructions, being
absolute, are nondifferent from Him. Hearing from Krsna or His expansion
or plenary expansion like Kapila is very pleasing to the senses. Bhagavad-
gita can be read or heard many times, but because it gives great pleasure,
the more one reads Bhagavad-gita the more he gets the appetite to read
and understand it, and each time he gets new enlightenment. That is the
nature of the transcendental message. Similarly, we find that transcendental

happiness in the Srimad-Bhdgavatam. The more we hear and chant the
glories of the Lord, the more we become happy.

TRANSLATION
Therefore please precisely describe all the activities and pastimes of the
Personality of Godhead, who is full of self-desire and who assumes all
these activities by His internal potency.
PURPORT
The word anukirtaya is very significant. Anukirtaya means to follow the
description—not to create a concocted mental description, but to follow.
Saunaka Rsi requested Siita Gosvami to describe what he had actually
heard from his spiritual master, Sukadeva Gosvami, about the transcenden-
tal pastimes which the Lord manifested by His internal energy. Bhagavan,
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has no material body, but He can
assume any kind of body by His supreme will. That is made possible by
His internal energy.

TRANSLATION
Sri Sita Gosvami said: The most powerful sage Maitreya was a friend
of Vyasadeva’s. Thus being encouraged, Maitreya, pleased by Vidura's
inquiry about transcendental knowledge, spoke as follows.
PURPORT
Questions and answers are very satisfactorily dealt with when the
inquirer is bona fide and the speaker is also authorized. Here Maitreya is
considered a powerful sage, and therefore he is also described as bhagavan.
This word can be used not only for the Supreme Personality of Godhead
but for anyone who is almost as powerful as the Supreme Lord. Maitreya
is addressed as bhagavdn because he was spiritually far advanced. He was
a personal friend of Dvaipayana Vyasadeva, who is a literary incarnation of
the Lord. Maitreya was very pleased with the inquiries of Vidura because
they were the inquiries of a bona fide advanced devotee. Thus Maitreya was
encouraged to answer. When there are discourses on transcendental topics
between devotees of equal mentality, the questions and answers are very
fruitful and encouraging.

TRANSLATION
Maitreya said: When Kardama left for the forest, Lord Kapila stayed on
the strand of the Bindu-sarovara in order to please His mother, Devahiiti.
PURPORT
In the absence of the father it is the duty of the grown-up son to take
charge of his mother and to serve her to the best of his capacity so that she
will not feel separation from her husband, and it is the duty of the
husband to leave home as soon as there is a grown-up son to take charge
of his wife and family affairs. That is the Vedic system of household life.
One should not remain continually implicated in household affairs up to
the time of death. He must leave. Family affairs and the wife may be
taken charge of by a grown-up son.

sitting at leisure, she questioned Him as follows.

TRANSLATION
Devabhiiti said: I am very sick of the disturbance of my material senses,
for because of this sense disturbance, my Lord, I have fallen into the
abyss of ignorance.
PURPORT
Here the word asad-indriya-tarsandt is significant. Asat means imperma-
nent, temporary, and indriya means senses. Thus asad-indriya-tarsanat
means from being agitated by the temporarily manifest senses of the mate-
rial body. We are evolving through different statuses of material bodily
existence—sometimes in a human body, sometimes in an animal body—
and therefore the engagements of our material senses are also changing.
Anything which changes is called temporary, or asat. We should know that
beyond these temporary senses are our permanent senses, which are now


--- Page 8 ---
1008 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 25
covered by the material body. The permanent senses, being contaminated
by matter, are not acting properly. Devotional service, therefore, involves
freeing the senses from this contamination. When the contamination is
completely removed and the senses act in the purity of unalloyed Krsna
consciousness, then we have reached sad-indriya, or eternal sense activities.
Eternal sensual activities are called devotional service, whereas temporary
sensual activities are called sense gratification. Unless one becomes tired of
material sense gratification, there is no opportunity to hear transcendental
messages from a person like Kapila. Devahiiti expressed that she was tired.
Now that her husband had left home, she wanted to get relief by hearing
the instructions of Lord Kapila.

TRANSLATION

Your Lordship is my only means of getting out of this darkest region of
ignorance because You are my transcendental eye, which, by Your mercy
only, I have attained after many, many births.

PURPORT

This verse is very instructive, since it indicates the relationship between
the spiritual master and the disciple. The disciple or conditioned soul is put
into this darkest region of ignorance and therefore is entangled in the
material existence of sense gratification. It is very difficult to get out of
this entanglement and attain freedom, but if one is fortunate enough to
get the association of a spiritual master like Kapila Muni or His representa-


--- Page 9 ---
Text 9] The Glories of Devotional Service 1009
tive, then by His grace one can be delivered from the mire of ignorance. The
spiritual master is therefore worshiped as one who delivers the disciple
from the mire of ignorance with the light of the torch of knowledge. The
word pdragam is very significant. Piragam means one who can take the
disciple to the other side. This side is conditioned life; the other side is the
life of freedom. The spiritual master takes the disciple to the other side by
opening his eyes with knowledge. We are suffering simply because of
ignorance. By the instruction of the spiritual master, the darkness of
ignorance is removed, and thus the disciple is enabled to go to the side of
freedom. It is stated in Bhagavad-gitd that after many, many births one
surrenders to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly, if, after
many, many births, one is able to find a bona fide spiritual master and
surrender to such a bona fide representative of Krsna, he can be taken to
the side of light.

TRANSLATION
You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the origin and Supreme

PURPORT
Kapila Muni is accepted as an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Krsna. Here the word ৫090৫ means the origin of all living entities,
and purisam i$vara means the Lord, or i$vara, of the living entities
(ष्वा) paramah krsnah ). Kapila Muni is the direct expansion of Krsna, who


--- Page 10 ---
1010 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 25
is the sun of spiritual knowledge. As the sun dissipates the darkness of the
universe, so when the light of the Supreme Personality of Godhead comes
down, it at once dissipates the darkness of maya. We have our eyes, but
without the light of the sun our eyes are of no value. Similarly, without
the light of the Supreme Lord, or without the divine grace of the spiritual
master, one cannot see things as they are.

TRANSLATION

Now be pleased, my Lord, to dispel my great delusion. Due to my
feeling of false ego, I have been engaged by Your maya and have identified
myself with the body and consequent bodily relations.

PURPORT

The false ego of identifying one’s body as one’s self and of claiming
things possessed in relationship with this body is called maya. In Bhagavad-
gita, Fifteenth Chapter, the Lord says, “I am sitting in everyone’s heart,
and from Me come everyone's remembrance and forgetfulness.”” Devahiiti
has stated that false identification of the body with the self and attachment
for possessions in relation to the body are also under the direction of the
Lord. Does this mean that the Lord discriminates by engaging one in His
devotional service and another in sense gratification? If that were true, it
would be an incongruity on the part of the Supreme Lord, but that is not
the actual fact. As soon as the living entity forgets his real constitutional
position of eternal servitorship to the Lord and wants instead to enjoy


--- Page 11 ---
Text 11] The Glories of Devotional Service 1011
himself by sense gratification, he is captured by mayd. This capture by
maya is the consciousness of false identification with the body and attach-
ment for the possessions of the body. These are the activities of mayd, and
since mdya is also an agent of the Lord, it is indirectly the action of the
Lord. The Lord is merciful; if anyone wants to forget Him and enjoy this
material world, He gives him full facility, not directly but through the
agency of His material potency. Therefore, since the material potency is
the Lord’s energy, indirectly it is the Lord who gives the facility to forget
Him. Devahiiti therefore said, “My engagement in sense gratification was
also due to You. Now kindly get me free from this entanglement.”

By the grace of the Lord one is allowed to enjoy this material world, but
when one is disgusted with material enjoyment and is frustrated, and when
one sincerely surrenders unto the lotus feet of the Lord, then the Lord is
so kind that He frees one from entanglement. Krsna says, therefore, in
Bhagavad-gita, “First of all surrender, and then I will take charge of you
and free you from all reactions of sinful activities.” Sinful activities are
those activities performed in forgetfulness of our relationship with the
Lord. In this material world, activities for material enjoyment which are
considered to be pious are also sinful. For example, one sometimes gives
something in charity to a needy person with a view to get back the money
four times increased. Giving with the purpose of gaining something is called
charity in the mode of passion. Everything done here is done in the modes
of material nature, and therefore all activities but service to the Lord are
sinful. Because of sinful activities we become attracted by the illusion
of material attachment, and we think, “I am this body.” I think of the
body as myself and of bodily possessions as “mine.” Devahiiti requested
Lord Kapila to free her from that entanglement of false identification and
false possession.

piirusasya— of spirit (man); namami—1I offer obeisances; sat-dharma— of the

TRANSLATION

Devahiiti continued: I have taken shelter of Your lotus feet because You
are the only person of whom to take shelter. You are the axe which can
cut the tree of material existence. I therefore offer my obeisances unto
You, who are the greatest of all transcendentalists, and I inquire from You
as to the relationship between man and woman and between spirit and
matter.

PURPORT

Sankhya philosophy, as is well known, deals with prakrti and purusa.
Purusa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead or anyone who imitates the
Supreme Personality of Godhead as an enjoyer, and prekrti means nature.
In this material world, material nature is being exploited by the purusas, or
the living entities. The intricacies in the material world of the relationship
of the prakrti and purusa, or the enjoyed and the enjoyer, is called sanisira,
or material entanglement. Devahiiti wanted to cut the tree of material
entanglement, and she found the suitable weapon in Kapila Muni. The tree
of material existence is explained in the Fifteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-
gitd as an asvattha tree whose root is upwards and whose branches are
downwards. It is recommended there that one has to cut the root of this
material existential tree with the axe of detachment. What is the attach-
ment? The attachment involves prakrti and purusa. The living entities are
trying to lord it over material nature. Since the conditioned soul takes
material nature to be the object of hisenjoyment and he takes the position
of the enjoyer, he is therefore called purusa.

Devahiiti questioned Kapila Muni, for she knew that only He could cut
her attachment for this material world. The living entities, in the guises of
men and women, are trying to enjoy the material energy; therefore in one
sense everyone is purusa because purusa means enjoyer and prakrti means
enjoyed. In this material world both the so-called man and so-called woman
are imitating the real purusa; the Supreme Personality of Godhead is actu-
ally the enjoyer in the transcendental sense, whereas all others are prakrti.


--- Page 13 ---
Text 12] The Glories of Devotional Service 1013
The living entities are considered prakrti. In Bhagavad-gitd, matter is ana-
lyzed as apard, or inferior nature, whereas beyond this inferior nature
there is another, superior nature—the living entities. Living entities are also
prakrti, or enjoyed, but under the spell of maya, the living entities are
falsely trying to take the position of enjoyers. That is the cause of sansara-
bandha, or conditional life. Devahiiti wanted to get out of conditional life
and place herself in full surrender. The Lord is saranya, which means the
only worthy personality to whom one can fully surrender, because He
is full of all opulences. If anyone actually wants relief, the best course is to
surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord is also
described here as sad-dharma-vidam varistham. This indicates that of all
transcendental occupations the best occupation is eternal loving service
unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Dharma is sometimes translated
as religion, but that is not exactly the meaning. Dharma actually means that
which one cannot give up, that which is inseparable from oneself. The
warmth of fire is inseparable from fire; therefore warmth is called the
dharma or nature of fire. Similarly, sad-dharma means eternal occupation.
That eternal occupation is engagement in the transcendental loving service
of the Lord. The purpose of Kapiladeva’s saiikhya philosophy is to propa-
gate pure, uncontaminated devotional service, and therefore He is addressed
here as the most important personality amongst those who know the tran-
scendental occupation of the living entity.

TRANSLATION

After hearing of His mother’s uncontaminated desire for transcendental
realization, the Lord thanked her within Himself for her questions, and
thus, His face smiling, He explained the path of the transcendentalists who
are interested in self realization.

PURPORT

Devahiiti has surrendered her confession of material entanglement and
her desire to gain release. Her questions to Lord Kapila are very interesting
for persons who are actually trying to get liberation from material entan-
glement and attain the perfectional stage of human life. Unless one is
interested in understanding his spiritual life or his constitutional position,
and unless he also feels inconvenience in material existence, his human form
of life is spoiled. One who does not care for these transcendental necessi-
ties of life and simply engages like an animal in eating, sleeping, fearing and
mating has spoiled his life. Lord Kapila was very much satisfied by His
mother’s questions because the answers stimulate one’s desire for liberation
from the conditional life of material existence. Such questions are called
apavarga-vardhanam. Those who have actual spiritual interest are called sat
or devotees. Satdm prasangat. Sat means that which eternally exists, and
asat means that which is not eternal. Unless one is situated on the spiritual
platform, he is not sat; he is asat. The asat stands on a platform which
will not exist, but anyone who stands on the spiritual platform will
exist eternally. As spirit soul, everyone exists eternally, but the asat has
accepted the material world as his shelter, and therefore he is full of
anxiety. Asad-grahdn, the incompatible situation of the spirit soul, who has
the false idea of enjoying matter, is the cause of the soul’s being asat.
Actually, the spirit soul is not asat. As soon as one is conscious of this fact
and takes to Krsna consciousness, then he becomes sat. Satam gatih, the
path of the eternal, is very interesting to persons who are after liberation,
and His Lordship Kapila began to speak about that path.

The Personality of Godhead answered: The yoga system which relates to
the Lord and the individual soul, which is meant for the ultimate benefit
of the living entity, and which causes detachment from all happiness and
distress in the material world, is the highest yoga system.
PURPORT
In the material world, everyone is trying to get some material happiness,
but as soon as we get some material happiness, there is also material
distress. In the material world one cannot have unadulterated happiness.
Any kind of happiness one has is contaminated by distress also. For
example, if we want to drink milk then we have to bother to maintain a
cow and keep her fit to supply milk. Drinking milk is very nice; it is also
pleasure. But for the sake of drinking milk one has to accept so much
trouble. The yoga system, as here stated by the Lord, is meant to end
all material happiness and material distress. The best yoga, as taught in
Bhagavad-gita by Krsna, is bhakti-yoga. It is also mentioned in the Gita
that one should try to be tolerant and not be disturbed by material hap-
piness or distress. Of course, one may say that he is not disturbed by
material happiness, but he does not know that just after one enjoys so-

1016 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 25
called material happiness, material distress will follow. This is the law of
the material world. Lord Kapila states that the yoga system is the science
of the spirit. One practices yoga in order to attain perfection on the
spiritual platform. There is no question of material happiness or distress.
It is transcendental. Lord Kapila will eventually explain how it is transcen-
dental, but the preliminary introduction is given here.

O most pious mother, I shall now explain unto you the ancient yoga

PURPORT
The Lord does not manufacture a new system of yoga. Sometimes it is
claimed that someone has become an incarnation of God and is expounding
a new theological aspect of the Absolute Truth. But here we find that
although Kapila Muni is the Lord Himself and is capable of manufacturing
a new doctrine for His mother, He nevertheless says, “I shall just explain
the ancient system which I once explained to the great sages because they
were also anxious to hear about it.”” When we have a superexcellent process
already present in Vedic scriptures, there is no need to concoct a new
system to mislead the innocent public. At present it has become a fashion
to reject the standard system and present something bogus in the name of
a newly invented process of yoga.

TRANSLATION
The stage in which the consciousness of the living entity is attracted by
the three modes of material nature is called conditional life. But when
that same consciousness is attached to the Supreme Personality of God-
head, one is situated in the consciousness of liberation.
PURPORT
There is a distinction here between Krsna consciousness and maya
consciousness. Gunesu, or mdyd consciousness, involves attachment to the
three material modes of nature, under which one works sometimes in
goodness and knowledge, sometimes in passion and sometimes in ignorance.
These different qualitative activities, with the central attachment for mate-
rial enjoyment, are the cause of one’s conditional life. When the same cetah,
or consciousness, is transferred to the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Krsna, or when one becomes Krsna conscious, he is on the path of libera-
tion.

TRANSLATION

When one is completely cleansed of the impurities of lust and greed
produced from the false indentification of the body as “I” and bodily
possessions as ‘“‘mine,” one’s mind becomes purified. In that pure state he
transcends the stage of so-called material happiness and distress.

PURPORT

Kama and lobha are the symptoms of material existence. Everyone
always desires to possess something. It is said here that desire and greed
are the products of false identification of oneself with the body. When one
becomes free from this contamination, then his mind and consciousness
also become freed and attain their original state. Mind, consciousness and
the living entity exist. Whenever we speak of the living entity, this includes
the mind and consciousness. The difference between conditional life and
liberated life occurs when we purify the mind and the consciousness. When
they are purified, one becomes transcendental to material happiness and
distress.

In the beginning Lord Kapila has said that perfect yoga is to transcend
the platform of material distress and happiness. How this can be done is
explained here: one has to purify his mind and consciousness. This can be
done by the bhakti-yoga system. As explained in the Narada-paiicaratra,
one’s mind and senses should be purified (tat-paratvena nirmalam). One’s
senses must be engaged in devotional service of the Lord. That is the pro-
cess. The mind must have some engagement. One cannot make the mind
vacant. Of course there are some foolish attempts to try to make the mind
vacant or void, but that is not possible. The only process that will purify
the mind is to engage it in Krsna. The mind must be engaged. If we engage
our mind in Krsna, naturally the consciousness becomes fully purified, and
there is no chance of the entrance of material desire and greed.

pure; prakrteh param—transcendental to material existence; nirantaram—
nondifferent;  svayam-jyotih—self-effulgent;  apimanam—infinitesimal;
akhanditam—not fragmented.

TRANSLATION

At that time the soul can see himself to be transcendental to material
existence and always self-effulgent, never fragmented, although very minute
in size.

PURPORT

In the state of pure consciousness or Krsna consciousness one can see
himself as a minute particle nondifferent from the Supreme Lord. As
stated in Bhagavad-gitd, the jiva or the individual soul is eternally part and
parcel of the Supreme Lord. Just as the sun’s rays are minute particles of
the brilliant constitution of the sun, so a living entity is a minute particle
of the Supreme Spirit. The individual soul and the Supreme Lord are not
separated as in material differentiation. The individual soul is a particle
from the very beginning. One should not think that because the individual
soul is a particle, it is fragmented from the whole spirit. Mayavada philoso-
phy enunciates that the whole spirit exists, but a part of it, which is called the
1800, is entrapped by illusion. This philosophy, however, is unacceptable be-
cause spirit cannot be divided like a fragment of matter. That part, the jiva,
is eternally a part. As long as the Supreme Spirit exists, His part and parcel
also exists. As long as the sun exists, the molecules of the sun’s rays also exist.

The jiva particle is estimated in the Vedic literature to be 1/10,000 the
size of the upper portion of a hair. It is therefore infinitesimal. The
Supreme Spirit is infinite, but the living entity or the individual soul is
infinitesimal, although it is not different in quality from the Supreme


--- Page 20 ---
1020 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 25
Spirit. Two words in this verse are to be particularly noted. One is
nirantaram, which means nondifferent or of the same quality. The indi-
vidual soul is also expressed here as animdanam. Apimanam means infinitesi-
mal. The Supreme Spirit is all-pervading, but the very small spirit is the
individual soul. Akhanditam means not exactly fragmented but constitu-
tionally always infinitesimal. No one can separate the molecular parts of
the sunshine from the sun, but at the same time the molecular part of the
sunshine is not as expansive as the sun itself. Similarly, the living entity,
by its constitutional position, is qualitatively the same as the Supreme
Spirit, but it is very infinitesimal.

TRANSLATION
In that position of self-realization, by practice of knowledge and
renunciation in devotional service, one sees everything in the right
perspective; he becomes indifferent to material existence, and the material
influence acts less powerfully upon him.
PURPORT
As the contamination of the germs of a particular disease can influence
a weaker person, similarly the influence of material nature or illusory
energy can act on the weaker or conditioned soul but not on the liberated
soul. Self-realization is the position of the liberated state. One understands
his constitutional position by knowledge and vairdgya, renunciation. With-


--- Page 21 ---
Text 19] The Glories of Devotional Service 1021
out knowledge, one cannot have realization. The realization that one is the
infinitesimal part and parcel of the Supreme Spirit makes him unattached
to material conditional life. That is the beginning of devotional service.
Unless one is liberated from material contamination, one cannot engage
himself in the devotional service of the Lord. In this verse, therefore, it is
stated, jidna-vairagya-yuktena: When one is in full knowledge of one’s
constitutional position and is in the renounced order of life, detached
from material attraction, then by pure devotional service, bhakti-yuktena,
he can engage himself as a loving servant of the Lord. Paripasyati means
that he can see everything in its right perspective. Then the influence of
material nature becomes almost nil. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-
gité. Brahma-bhitah prasanndtmd: When one is self-realized he becomes
happy and free from the influence of material nature, and at that time he
is freed from lamentation and hankering. The Lord states that position as
mad-bhaktim labhate param, the real state of beginning devotional service.
Similarly, it is confirmed in the Narada-paiicardtra that when the senses
are purified they can then be engaged in the devotional service of the Lord.
One who is attached to material contamination cannot be a devotee.

TRANSLATION

Perfection in self-realization cannot be attained by any kind of yogi
unless he engages in devotional service to the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, because that is the only auspicious path.


--- Page 22 ---
1022 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 25
PURPORT

That knowledge and renunciation are never perfect unless joined by
devotional service is explicitly explained here. Na yujyamdnayd means with-
out being dovetailed. When there is devotional service, then the question is
where to offer that service. Devotional service is to be offered to the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the Supersoul of everything, for
that is the only reliable path of self-realization or Brahman realization. The
word brahma-siddhaye means to understand oneself to be different from
matter, to understand oneself to be Brahman. The Vedic words are aha
brahmdsmi. Brahma-siddhi means that one should know that he is not
matter; he is pure soul. There are different kinds of yogis, but every yogi
is supposed to engage in self realization or Brahman realization. 11 is clearly
stated here that unless one is fully engaged in the devotional service of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead one cannot have easy approach to the
path of brahma-siddhi.

In the beginning of the Second Chapter of Srimad-Bhagavatam it
is stated that when one engages himself in the devotional service of
Vasudeva, spiritual knowledge and renunciation of the material world
automatically become manifest. Thus a devotee does not have to try
separately for renunciation or knowledge. Devotional service itself is so
powerful that by one’s service attitude, everything is revealed. It is stated
here, $ivah pantha: this is the only auspicious path for self-realization. The
path of devotional service is the most confidential means for attaining
Brahman realization. That perfection in Brahman realization is attained
through the auspicious path of devotional service indicates that the so-
called Brahman realization or realization of the brahmajyoti effulgence is
not brahma-siddhi. Beyond that brahmajyoti there is the Supreme Person-
ality of Godhead. In the Upanisads a devotee prays to the Lord to kindly
put aside the effulgence, brahmajyoti, so that the devotee may see within
the brahmajyoti the actual eternal form of the Lord. Unless one attains
realization of the transcendental form of the Lord, there is no question of
bhakti. Bhakti necessitates the existence of the recipient of devotional
service and the devotee who renders devotional service. Brahma-siddhi
through devotional service is realization of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. The understanding of the effulgent rays of the body of the
Supreme Godhead is not the perfect stage of brahma-siddhi or Brahman
realization. Nor is the realization of the Paramatma feature of the Supreme
Person perfect because Bhagavan, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is
akhilatma—He is the Supersoul. One who realizes the Supreme Personality


--- Page 23 ---
Text 20) The Glories of Devotional Service 1023
realizes the other features, namely the Paramatma feature and the Brahman
feature, and that total realization is brahma-siddhi.

TRANSLATION
Every learned man knows very well that attachment for the material is
the greatest entanglement of the spirit soul. But that same attachment,
when applied to the self-realized devotees, opens the door of liberation.
PURPORT
Here it is clearly stated that attachment for one thing is the cause of
bondage in conditioned life, and the same attachment, when applied to
something else, opens the door of liberation. Attachment cannot be
killed; it has simply to be transferred. Attachment for material things is
called material consciousness, and attachment for Krsna or His devotee is
called Krsna consciousness. Consciousness, therefore, is the platform of
attachment. It is clearly stated here that when we simply purify the
consciousness from material consciousness to Krsna consciousness, that is
liberation. Despite the statement that one should give up attachment,
desirelessness is not possible for a living entity. A living entity, by
constitution, has the propensity to be attached to something. We see that
if someone has no object of attachment, if he has no children, then he
transfers his attachment to cats and dogs. This indicates that the pro-
pensity for attachment cannot be stopped; it must be utilized for the best


--- Page 24 ---
1024 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 25
purpose. Our attachment for material things perpetuates our conditional
state, but the same attachment, when transferred to the Supreme Person-
ality of Godhead or His devotee, is the source of liberation.

Here it is recommended that attachment should be transferred to the
self-realized devotees, the sadhus. And who is a sadhu? A sddhu is not just
an ordinary man with a saffron robe or long beard. A 5৫018 is described in
Bhagavad-gita as one who unflinchingly engages in devotional service. Even
though one is found not to be following the strict rules and regulations
of devotional service, if one simply has unflinching faith in Krsna, the
Supreme Person, he is understood to be a sadhu. Sadhur eva sa mantavyah.
A sadhu is a strict follower of devotional service. It is recommended here
that if one at all wants to realize Brahman or spiritual perfection, his
attachment should be transferred to the sdidhu or devotee. Lord Caitanya
also confirmed this. Lava-mdtra sadhu-saiige sarva-siddhi haya: simply by a
moment’s association with a sadhu one can attain perfection.

Mahatma is a synonym of 5৫018. It is said that service to a mahdtma or
elevated devotee of the Lord is dvaram ahur vimukteh, the royal road of
liberation. Mahat-sevari dvaram ahur vimuktes tamo-dvdram yositam sangi-
saitgam. Rendering service to the materialists has the opposite effect. If
anyone offers service to a gross materialist or a person engaged only in
sense enjoyment, then by association with such a person the door to hell
is opened (Bhdg. 5.5.2). The same principle is confirmed here. Attachment
to a devotee is attachment to the service of the Lord because if one
associates with a sddhu, then the result will be that the 5৫018 will teach him
how to become a devotee, a worshiper and a sincere servitor of the Lord.
These are the gifts of a sddhu. If we want to associate with a sadhu we
cannot expect him to give us instructions on how to improve our material
condition, but he will give us instructions on how to cut the knot of the
contamination of material attraction and how to elevate ourselves in
devotional service. That is the result of associating with a sadhu. Kapila
Muni first of all instructs that the path of liberation begins with such
association.

TRANSLATION

The symptoms of a sadhu are that he is tolerant, merciful and friendly
to all living entities. He has no enemies, he is peaceful, he abides by the
scriptures, and all his characteristics are sublime.

PURPORT

A sadhu, as described above, is a devotee of the Lord. His concern,
therefore, is to enlighten people in devotional service to the Lord. That is
his mercy. He knows that without devotional service to the Lord, human
life is spoiled. A devotee travels all over the country, from door to door,
preaching, “Be Krsna conscious. Be a devotee of Lord Krsna. Don’t spoil
your life in simply fulfilling your animal propensities. Human life is meant
for self-realization or Krsna consciousness.” These are the preachings of a
sadhu. He is not satisfied with his own liberation. He always thinks about
others. He is the most compassionate personality towards all the fallen
souls. @ne of his qualifications, therefore, 18 kdrunika, great mercy to the
fallen souls. While engaged in preaching work he has to meet with so many
opposing elements, and therefore the sidhu or devotee of the Lord has to
be very tolerant. Someone may ill-treat him because the conditioned souls
are not prepared to receive the transcendental knowledge of devotional
service. They don’t like it;that is their disease. The sidhu has the thankless
task of impressing upon them the importance of devotional service.
Sometimes devotees are personally attacked with violence. Lord Jesus
Christ was crucified, Haridasa Thakura was caned in twenty-two market-
places, and Lord Caitanya’s principal assistant, Nityananda, was violently
attacked by Jagdi and Madhai. But still they were tolerant because their
mission was to deliver the fallen souls. ®ne of the qualifications of ৪ sadhu
is that he is very tolerant and is merciful to all fallen souls. He is merciful
because he is the well-wisher of all living entities. He is not only a well-
wisher of human society, but a well-wisher of animal society as well. it is
said here, sarva-dehinam, which indicates all living entities who have


--- Page 26 ---
1026 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 25
accepted a material body. Not only does the human being have a material
body, but other living entities, such as cats and dogs, also have material
bodies. The devotee of the Lord is merciful to everyone—the cats, dogs,
trees, etc. He treats all living entities in such a way that they can ultimately
get salvation from this material entanglement. Sivananda Sena, one of the
disciples of Lord Caitanya, gave liberation to a dog by treating the dog
transcendentally. There are many instances where a dog got salvation by
association with a sddhu because a sadhu engages in the highest philan-
thropic activities for the benediction of all living entities. Yet although a
sadhu is not inimical towards anyone, the world is so ungrateful that even
a sidhu has many enemies.

What is the difference between an enemy and a friend? It is a difference
in behavior. A sadhu behaves with all conditioned souls for their ultimate
relief from the material entanglement. Therefore, no one can be more
friendly than a sadhu in relieving a conditioned soul. A sadhu is calm, and
he quietly and peacefully follows the principles of scripture. A sadhu
means one who follows the principles of scripture and at the same time is
a devotee of the Lord. One who actually follows the principles of scripture
must be a devotee of God because all the sdstras instruct us to obey the
orders of the Personality of Godhead. Sadhu, therefore, means a follower
of the scriptural injunctions and a devotee of the Lord. All these charac-
teristics are prominent in a devotee. A devotee develops all the good
qualities of the demigods, whereas a nondevotee, even though academically
qualified, has no actual good qualifications or good characteristics in the
standard of transcendental realization.

TRANSLATION

Such a sadhu engages in staunch devotional service to the Lord without
deviation. For the sake of the Lord he renounces all other connections,
such as family relationships and friendly acquaintances within the world.

PURPORT

A person in the renounced order of life, a sannyasi, is also called a
sadhu because he renounces everything—his home, his comfort, his friends,
his relatives and his duties to friends and to family. He renounces every-
thing for the sake of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A sannydsi is
generally in the renounced order of life, but his renunciation will be
successful only when his energy is employed in the service of the Lord
withgreatausterity. It is said here, therefore, bhaktir kurvanti ye drdham.
A person who seriously engages in the service of the Lord and is in the
renounced order of life is a sddhu. A sadhu is one who has given up all
responsibility to society, family and worldly humanitarianism simply for
the sake of the service of the Lord. As soon as he takes his birth in the
world, a person has so many responsibilities and obligations—to the public,
to the demigods, to the great sages, to the general living beings, to his
parents, to the family forefathers, and to many others. When he gives up
all such obligations for the sake of the service of the Supreme Lord, he is
not punished for such renunciation of obligation. But if for sense gratifica-
tion a person renounces all such obligations, he is punished by the law of
nature.

TRANSLATION
Engaged constantly in chanting and hearing about Me, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, the sadhus do not suffer from material miseries
because they are always filled with thoughts of My pastimes and activities.
PURPORT
There are multifarious miseries in material existence—those pertaining
to the body and the mind, those imposed by other living entities, and
those imposed by natural disturbances. But a sidhu is not disturbed by
such miserable conditions because his mind is always filled with Krsna
consciousness, and thus he does not like to talk about anything but the
activities of the Lord. Maharaja Ambarisa did not speak of anything but
the pastimes of the Lord. Vacamsi vaikuntha-gunanuvarnane. He engaged
his words only in glorification of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Sadhus are always interested in hearing about the activities of the Lord or
His devotees. Since they are filled with Krsna consciousness, they are
forgetful of the material miseries. Ordinary conditioned souls, being
forgetful of the activities of the Lord, are always full of anxieties and
material tribulations. On the other hand, since the devotees always engage
in the topics of the Lord, they are forgetful of the miseries of material
existence.

TRANSLATION

0 My mother, O virtuous lady, these are the qualities of great devotees
who are free from all attachment. You must seek attachment to such holy
men, for this counteracts the pernicious effects of material attachment.

PURPORT

Kapila Muni herein advises His mother, Devahiti, that if she wants to
be free from material attachment then she should increase her attachment
for the sidhus or devotees who are completely freed from all material
attachment. In Bhagavad-gita, Fifteenth Chapter, fifth verse, it is stated
who is qualified to enter into the kingdom of Godhead. It is said there,
nirmdna-mohad jita-sanga-dosah. This refers to one who is completely freed
from the puffed-up condition of material possessiveness. A person may be
materially very rich, opulent or respectable, but if he at all wants to
transfer himself to the spiritual kingdom, back home, back to Godhead,
then he has to be freed from the puffed-up condition of material
possessiveness, because that is a false position.

The word moha, used here, means the false understanding that one is
rich or poor. In this material world, the conception that one is very rich
or very poor—or any such consciousness in connection with material
existence—is false, because this body itself is false or temporary. A pure
soul who is prepared to be freed from this material entanglement must first
of all be free from the association of the three modes of nature. Our
consciousness at the present moment is polluted because of association
with the three modes of nature; therefore in Bhagavad-gita the same
principle is stated. It is advised, jita-saiiga-dosdh: one should be freed from
the contaminated association of the three modes of material nature. Here
also, in the Srimad-Bhagavatam, this is confirmed: a pure devotee who is
preparing to transfer himself to the spiritual kingdom is also freed from
the association of the three modes of material nature. We have to seek
the association of such devotees. For this reason we have begun the
International Society for Krishna Consciousness. There are many mercan-
tile, scientific and other associations in human society to develop a
particular type of education or consciousness, but there is no association
which helps one to get free from all material association. If anyone has
reached the stage where he must become free from this material contami-


--- Page 30 ---
1030 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 25
nation, then he has to seek the association of devotees, wherein Krsna
consciousness is exclusively cultured. One can thereby become freed from
all material association.

Because a devotee is freed from all contaminated material association,
he is not affected by the miseries of material existence. Even though he
appears to be in the material world, he is not affected by the miseries of
the material world. How is it possible? There is a very good example in the
activities of the cat. The cat carries her kittens in her mouth, and when she
kills a rat she also carries the booty in her mouth. Thus both are carried in
the mouth of the cat, but they are in different conditions. The kitten feels
comfort in the mouth of the mother, whereas when the rat is carried in
the mouth of the cat, the rat feels the blows of death. Similarly, those who
are sadhavah, or devotees engaged in Krsna consciousness in the transcen-
dental service of the Lord, do not feel the contamination of material
miseries, whereas those who are not devotees in Krsna consciousness
actually feel the miseries of material existence. One should therefore give
up the association of materialistic persons and seek the association of
persons engaged in Krsna consciousness, and by such association he will be
benefited in spiritual advancement. By their words and instructions, he
will be able to cut off his attachment to material existence.

TRANSLATION

In the association of pure devotees, discussion of the pastimes and
activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is very pleasing and
satisfying to the ear and the heart. By cultivating such knowledge one
gradually becomes advanced on the path of liberation, and thereafter he is
freed, and his attraction becomes fixed. Then real devotion and devotional
service begin.

PURPORT

The process of advancing in Krsna consciousness and devotional service
is described here. The first point is that one must seek the association of
persons who are Krsna conscious and who engage in devotional service.
Without such association one cannot make advancement. Simply by
theoretical knowledge or study one cannot make any appreciable advance-
ment. One must give up the association of materialistic persons and seek
the association of devotees because without the association of devotees
one cannot understand the activities of the Lord. Generally, people are
convinced of the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth. Because they
do not associate with devotees, they cannot understand that the Absolute
Truth can be a person and have personal activities. This is a very difficult
subject matter, and unless one has personal understanding of the Absolute
Truth, there is no meaning to devotion. Service or devotion cannot be
offered to anything impersonal. Service must be offered to व 1
Nondevotees cannot appreciate Krsna consciousness by reading the Srimad-
Bhagavatam or any other Vedic literature wherein the activities of the
Lord are described; they think that they are fiction, manufactured stories,
because spiritual life is not explained to them in the proper mood. To
understand the personal activities of the Lord one has to seek the associa-
tion of devotees, and by such association, when one contemplates and
tries to understand the transcendental activities of the Lord, then his path
to liberation is open, and he is freed. One who has firm faith in the
Supreme Personality of Godhead becomes fixed, and his attraction for
association with the Lord and the devotees increases. Association with
devotees means association with the Lord. The devotee who makes this
association develops the consciousness for rendering service to the Lord,
and then, being situated in the transcendental position of devotional ser-
vice, he gradually becomes perfect.

TRANSLATION
Thus consciously engaged in devotional service in the association of
devotees, a person gains distaste for sense gratification, both in this world
and in the next, by constantly thinking about the activities of the Lord.
This process of Krgna consciousness is the easiest process of mystic power;
when one is actually situated on that path of devotional service, he is able
to control the mind.
PURPORT
In all scriptures people are encouraged to act in a pious way so that
they can enjoy sense gratification not only in this life but also in the next.
For example, one is promised promotion to the heavenly kingdom of
higher planets by pious fruitive activities. But a devotee in the association
of devotees prefers to contemplate the activities of the Lord—how He has
created this universe, how He is maintaining it, how the creation dissolves,
and how in the spiritual kingdom the Lord’s pastimes are going on. There
are full literatures describing these activities of the Lord, especially
Bhagavad-gitd, Brahma-sarithita and Srimad-Bhagavatam. The sincere devo-


--- Page 33 ---
Text 27] The Glories of Devotional Service 1033
tee who associates with devotees gets the opportunity to hear and con-
template this subject of the pastimes of the Lord, and the result is that he
feels distaste for so-called happiness in this or that world, in heaven or on
other planets. The devotees are simply interested in being transferred to
the personal association of the Lord; they have no more attraction for
temporary so-called happiness. That is the position of one who is yoga-
yukta. One who is fixed in mystic power is not disturbed by the allurement
of this world or that world; he isinterested in the matters of spiritual under-
standing or the spiritual situation. This sublime situation is very easily
attained by the easiest process, bhakti-yoga. Rjubhir yoga-margaih. A
very suitable word used here 15 rjubhih, or very easy. There are different
processes of yoga-marga, attaining yoga perfection, but this process,
devotional service to the Lord, is the easiest. Not only is it the easiest
process, but the result is sublime. Everyone, therefore, should try to take
this process of Krsna consciousness and reach the highest perfection of life.

practicing yoga, in which the mind is always fixed in devotional service
unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one achieves My association in
this very life, for I am the Supreme Personality, the Absolute Truth.

PURPORT

When one engages in devotional service to the Lord in the nine different

kinds of bhakti-yoga, as enunciated in authoritative scriptures, such as by
hearing (sravapam), chanting (kirtanam), remembering, offering worship,
praying and offering personal service—either in one of them, or two, or
three or all of them—he naturally has no opportunity to engage in the
service of the three modes of material nature. Unless one has good
engagements in spiritual service, it is not possible to get out of the attach-
ment to material service. Those who are not devotees, therefore, are
interested in so-called humanitarian or philanthropic work, such as opening
a hospital or charitable institution. These are undoubtedly good works in
the sense that they are pious activities, and their result is that the perform-
er may get some opportunities for sense gratification, either in this life
or in the next. Devotional service, however, is beyond the boundary of
sense gratification. It is completely spiritual activity. When one engages in
the spiritual activities of devotional service, naturally he does not get any
opportunity to engage in sense gratificatory activities. Krsna conscious
activities are performed not blindly but with perfect understanding of
knowledge and renunciation. This kind of yoga practice, in which the
mind is always fixed upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead in
devotion, results in liberation in this very life. The person who performs
such acts gets in touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord
Caitanya, therefore, approved the process of hearing from realized devo-
tees about the pastimes of the Lord. It does not matter to what category
of this world the audience belongs. If one meekly and submissively hears
about the activities of the Lord from a realized soul, he will be able to
conquer the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is unconquerable by
any other process. Hearing or associating with devotees is the most
important function for self-realization.

It is stated in Bhagavad-gita that no one is barred from rendering service
to the Lord. Whether one is a woman or a laborer or a merchant, if he
engages himself in the devotional service of the Lord he is promoted to the
highest perfectional state and goes back home, back to Godhead. The
devotional service which is most suitable for different types of devotees
is determined and fixed by the mercy of the spiritual master.

TRANSLATION

The mystic yoga system, as you have explained, aims at the Supreme
Personality of Godhead and is meant for completely ending material
existence. Please let me know what the nature of that yoga system is. How
many ways are there by which one can understand in truth that sublime
yoga?

PURPORT

There are different kinds of mystic yoga systems aiming for different
phases of the Absolute Truth. The jiidna-yoga system aims at the imper-
sonal Brahman effulgence, and the hatha-yoga system aims at the localized
personal aspect, the Paramatma feature of the Absolute Truth, whereas
bhakti-yoga, or devotional service, which is executed in nine different ways,
headed by hearing and chanting, aims at complete realization of the Su-
preme Lord. There are different methods of self-realization. But here
Devahiiti especially refers to the bhakti-yoga system, which has already
been primarily explained by the Lord. The different parts of the bhakti-
yoga system are hearing, chanting, remembering, offering prayers, wor-
shiping the Lord in the temple, accepting service to Him, carrying out His
orders, making friendship with Him, and, after all, surrendering everything
for the service of the Lord. The word nirvandtman is very significant
in this verse. Unless one accepts the process of devotional service,
one cannot end the continuation of material existence. As far as
jidnis are concerned, they are interested in jiidna-yoga, but even if one
elevates oneself, after a great performance of austerity, to the Brahman
effulgence, there is a chance of falling down again in the material world.
Therefore, jiidna-yoga does not actually end material existence. Similarly,
regarding the hatha-yoga system, which aims at the localized aspect of the
Lord, Paramatma, it has been experienced that many yogis, such as
Visvamitra, fall down. But bhakti-yogis, once approaching the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, never come back to this material world, as it is
confirmed in the Bhagavad-grta. Yad gatvd na nivartante: upon going, one
never comes back. Tyaktva deham punar janma naiti: after giving up this
body, he never comes back again to accept a material body. Nirvana does
not finish the existence of the soul. The soul is ever-existing. Therefore
nirvana means to end one’s material existence, and to end material exis-
tence means to go back home, back to Godhead.

Sometimes it is questioned how the living entity falls down from the
spiritual world to the material world. Here is the answer. Unless one is


--- Page 37 ---
Text 30] The Glories of Devotional Service 1037
elevated to the Vaikuntha planets, directly in touch with the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, he is prone to fall down, either from the imperson-
al Brahman realization or from an ecstatic trance of meditation. Another
word in this verse, bhagavad-banah, is very significant. Bainah means arrow.
The bhakti-yoga system is just like an arrow aiming up to the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhcad. The bhakti-yoga system never urges one towards the
impersonal Brahman effulgence or to the point of Paramatma realization.
This banah, or arrow, is so sharp and swift that it goes directly to the Su-
preme Personality of Godhead, penetrating the regions of impersonal Brah-
man and localized Paramatma.

PURPORT
Knowledge of the Absolute Truth is not very easily understood by
ordinary, less intelligent men; but if the spiritual master is kind enough to
the disciple, however unintelligent he may be, then by the divine grace of
the spiritual master everything is revealed. Viévanatha Cakravarti Thakura
therefore says, yasya prasidad, by the mercy of the spiritual master,

bhagavat-prasidah, the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is
revealed. Devahiiti requested her great son to be merciful towards her
because she was a less intelligent woman and also His mother. By the
grace of Kapiladeva it was quite possible for her to understand the
Absolute Truth, even though the subject matter is very difficult for
ordinary persons, especially women.

Lord Kapila said: The senses are symbolic representations of the
demigods, and their natural inclination is to work under the direction of
the Vedic injunctions. As the senses are representatives of the demigods, so
the mind is the representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The
mind's natural duty is to serve. When that service spirit is engaged in devo-
tional service to the Personality of Godhead, without any motive, that is
far better even than salvation.
PURPORT
The senses of the living entity are always engaged in some occupation,
either in activities prescribed in the injunctions of the Vedas or in material
activities. The natural inclination of the senses is to work for something,


--- Page 40 ---
1040 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 25
and the mind is the center of the senses. The mind is actually the leader of
the senses; therefore it is called sattva. Similarly, the leader of all the
demigods who are engaged in the activities of this material world—the sun,
moon, Indra, etc.—is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

It is stated in the Vedic literature that the demigods are different limbs
of the universal body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Our senses
are also controlled by different demigods; our senses are representations of
various demigods, and the mind is the representation of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. The senses, led by the mind, act under the
influence of the demigods. When the service is ultimately aimed at the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, the senses are in their natural position.
The Lord is called Hrsikeda, for He is actually the proprietor and ultimate
master of the senses. The senses and the mind are naturally inclined to
work, but when they are materially contaminated they work for some
material benefit or for the service of the demigods, although actually they
are meant to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The senses are
called hrsika, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead is called Hrsikesa.
Indirectly, all the senses are naturally inclined to serve the Supreme Lord.
That is called bhakti.

Kapiladeva said that when the senses, without desire for material
profit or other selfish motives, are engaged in the service of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, that is called devotional service. That spirit of
service is far better than siddhi, salvation. Bhakti, the inclination to serve
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is in a transcendental position far
better than mukti or liberation. Thus bhakti is the stage after liberation.
Unless one is liberated one cannot engage the senses in the service of the
Lord. When the senses are engaged either in material activities of sense
gratification or in the activities of the Vedic injunctions, there is some
motive, but when the same senses are engaged in the service of the Lord
and there is no motive, that is called animitta and is the natural inclination
of the mind. The conclusion is that when the mind, without being deviated
either to Vedic injunctions or material activities, is fully engaged in Krsna
consciousness or devotional service to the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, it is far better than the most aspired for liberation from material
entanglement.

jarayati—dissolves; asu—quickly; ya—which; kosam—the subtle body;

TRANSLATION
Bhakti, devotional service, dissolves the subtle body of the living entity
without separate effort, just as fire in the stomach digests all that we eat.
PURPORT
Bhaktiisin a far higher position than mukti because a person’s endeavor
to get liberation from the material encagement is automatically served in
devotional service. The example is given here that the fire in the stomach
can digest whatever we eat. If the digestive power is sufficient, then what-
ever we can eat will be digested by the fire in the stomach. Similarly, a
devotee doesn’t have to try separately to attain liberation. That very
service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the process of his
liberation because to engage oneself in the service of the Lord is already
liberation from material entanglement. Sri Bilvamaigala Thakura explained
this position very nicely. He said, “If I have unflinching devotion unto the
lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, then mukti or liberation serves me as my
maidservant. Mukti, the maidservant, is always ready to do whatever I ask.”
For a devotee, liberation is no problem at all. Liberation takes place
without separate endeavor. Bhakti, therefore, is far better than mukti or
the impersonalist position. The impersonalists undergo severe penances and
austerities to attain mukti, but the bhakta, simply by engaging himself in
the bhakti process, especially in chanting Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna
Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare,
immediately develops control over the tongue by engaging it in chanting
and accepting the remnants of foodstuff offered to the Personality of
Godhead. As soon as the tongue is controlled, naturally all other senses
are controlled automatically. Sense control is the perfection of the yoga
principle, and one’s liberation begins immediately as soon as he engages
himself in the service of the Lord. It is confirmed by Kapiladeva that
bhakti or devotional service is gariyasi, more glorious than siddhi, libera-
tion.

TRANSLATION
A pure devotee who is attached to the activities of devotional service
and who always engages in the service of My lotus feet never desires to
become one with Me. Such a devotee, who is unflinchingly engaged, always
glorifies My pastimes and activities.
PURPORT
There are five kinds of liberation stated in the scriptures. One is to
become one with the Supreme Personality of Godhead or to forsake one’s
individuality and merge into the Supreme Spirit. This is called ekatmatam.
A devotee never accepts this kind of liberation. The other four liberations
are to be promoted to the same planet as God, Vaikuntha, to associate
personally with the Supreme Lord, to achieve the same opulence as the
Lord and to attain the same bodily features as the Supreme Lord. A pure
devotee, as will be explained by Kapila Muni, does not aspire for any of the
five liberations. He especially despises as hellish becoming one with the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Sri Prabodhananda Sarasvati, a great
devotee of Lord Caitanya, said kaivalyarn narakayate: “The happiness of
becoming one with the Supreme Lord, which is aspired to by the
Mayavadis, is considered to be hellish.” That oneness is not for pure
devotees.
There are many so-called devotees who think that in the conditioned
state we may worship the Personality of Godhead, but ultimately there is
no personality; they say that since the Absolute Truth is impersonal, one


--- Page 43 ---
Text 34] The Glories of Devotional Service 1043
can imagine a personal form of the impersonal Absolute Truth for the
time being, but as soon as one becomes liberated the worship stops.
That is the theory put forward by the Mayavada philosophy. Actually the
impersonalists do not merge into the existence of the Supreme Person
but into His personal bodily luster, which is called brahmajyoti. Although
that brahmajyoti is not different from His personal body, that sort of
oneness or merging into the bodily luster of the Personality of Godhead
is not accepted by a pure devotee because the devotees engage in greater
pleasure than the so-called pleasure of merging into His existence. The
greatest pleasure is to serve the Lord. Devotees are always thinking about
how to serve Him; they are always designing ways and means to serve the
Supreme Lord, even in the midst of the greatest obstacles of material
existence.

The Mayavadis accept the description of the pastimes of the Lord as
stories, but actually they are not stories; they are historical facts. Pure
devotees accept the narrations of the pastimes of the Lord not as stories
but as Absolute Truth. The words mama paurusapi are significant. Devotees
are very much attached to glorifying the activities of the Lord, whereas
the Mayavadis cannot even think of these activities. According to them
the Absolute Truth is impersonal. Without personal existence, how can
there be activity? The impersonalists take the activities mentioned in the
Srimad-Bhagavatam, Bhagavad-gita, and other Vedic literatures as fictitious
stories, and therefore they interpret them most mischievously. They have
no idea of the Personality of Godhead. They unnecessarily poke their
noses into the scripture and interpret it in a deceptive way in order to
mislead the innocent public. The activities of Mayavada philosophy are very
dangerousto the public, and therefore Lord Caitanya warned never to hear
from any Mayavadi about any scripture. They will spoil the entire process,
and the person hearing them will never be able to come to the path of
devotional service to attain the highest perfection, or will be able to do so
only after a very long time.

It is clearly stated by Kapila Muni that bhakti activities or activitiesin
devotional service are transcendental to mukti. This is called paiicama-
purusdrtha. Generally, people engage in the activities of religion, economic
development and sense gratification, and ultimately they work with an
idea that they are going to become one with the Supreme Lord (mukti).
But bhakti is transcendental to all these activities. The Srimad-Bhagavatam,
therefore, begins by stating that all kinds of pretentious religiosity is
completely eradicated from the Bhdgavatam. Ritualistic activities for
economic development and sense gratification, and, after frustration in


--- Page 44 ---
1044 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 25
sense gratification, the desire to become one with the Supreme Lord, are
all completely rejected in the Bhagavatam. The Bhagavatam is especially
meant for the pure devotees who always engage in Krsna consciousness, in
the activities of the Lord, and always glorify these transcendental activities.
Pure devotees worship the transcendental activities of the Lord in
Vrndavana, Dvaraka and Mathura as they are narrated in the Srimad-
Bhagavatam and other Puranas. The Mayavadi philosophers completely
reject them as stories, but actually they are great and worshipable subject
matter and thus are relishable only for devotees. That is the difference
between a Mayavadi and a pure devotee.

O My mother, My devotees always see the smiling face of My form, with

forms, which are all benevolent, and they also talk favorably with Me.
PURPORT
Mayavadis and atheists accept the forms of the Deities in the temple of
the Lord as idols, but the devotees do not worship idols. They directly
worship the Personality of Godhead in His arca incarnation. Arcd refers to
the form which we can worship in our present condition. Actually in our


--- Page 45 ---
Text 36] The Glories of Devotional Service 1045
present state it is not possible to see God in His spiritual form because our
material eyes and senses cannot conceive of a spiritual form. We cannot
even see the spiritual form of the individual soul. When a man dies we
cannot see how the spiritual form leaves the body. That is the defect of
our material senses. In order to be seen by our material senses, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead accepts a favorable form which is called arca-
vigraha. This arca-vigraha, sometimes called the arca incarnation, is not
different from Him. Just as the Supreme Personality of Godhead accepts
various incarnations, so He takes on forms made out of matter—clay, wood,
metal, jewels, etc.

There are many $astric injunctions which give instructions for carving
forms of the Lord. These forms are not material. If God is all-pervading,
then He is also in the material elements. There is no doubt about it. But
the atheists think otherwise. Although they preach that everything is God,
when they go to the temple and see the form of the Lord, they deny that
He is God. According to their own theory, everything is God. Then why
is the Deity not God? Actually, they have no conception of God. The
devotees’ vision, however, is different; their vision is smeared with love of
God. As soon as they see the Lord in His different forms the devotees
become saturated with love, for they do not find any difference between
the Lord and His form in the temple, as do the atheists. The smiling face of
the Deity in the temple is beheld by the devotees as very transcendental
and spiritual, and the decoration of the body of the Lord is very much
appreciated by the devotees. It is the duty of the spiritual master to teach
how to decorate the Deity in the temple, how to cleanse the temple and
how to worship the Deity. There are different procedures and rules and
regulations which are followed in temples of Visnu, and devotees go there
and see the Deity, the vigraha, and spiritually enjoy the form because
all of the Deities are benevolent. The devotees express their minds before
the Deity, and in many instances the Deity also gives answers. But one
must be a very elevated devotee in order to be able to speak with the
Supreme Lord. Sometimes the Lord informs the devotee through dreams.
These exchanges of feelings between the Deity and the devotee are not
understandable by atheists, but actually the devotee enjoys. Kapila Muni
is explaining how the devotees see the decorated body and face of the
Deity and how they speak with Him in devotional service.

TRANSLATION

Upon seeing the charming forms of the Lord, smiling and attractive,
and hearing His very pleasing words, the pure devotee almost loses all
other consciousness. His senses are freed from all other engagements, and
he becomes absorbed in devotional service. Thus in spite of his unwilling-
ness, he gets liberation without separate endeavor.

PURPORT

There are three divisions of devotees—first-class, second-class and third-
class. Even the third-class devotees are liberated souls. It is explained in
this verse that although they do not have knowledge, simply by seeing the
beautiful decoration of the Deity in the temple, the devolee is absorbed in
thought of Him and loses all other consciousness. Simply by fixing oneself
in Krsna consciousness, engaging the senses in the service of the Lord, one
is imperceptibly liberated. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita. Simply
by discharging uncontaminated devotional service as prescribed in the
scriptures, one becomes equal to Brahman. In Bhagavad-gita it is said,
brahma-bhitydya kalpate. This means that the living entity in his original
state is Brahman because he is part and parcel of the Supreme Brahman.
But simply because of his forgetfulness of his real nature as an eternal
servitor of the Lord, he is overwhelmed and captured by maya. His
forgetfulness of his real constitutional position is mdyd. Otherwise he is
eternally Brahman.


--- Page 47 ---
Text 36] The Glories of Devotional Service 1047

When one is trained to become conscious of his position, he understands
that he is the servitor of the Lord. Brahman refers to a state of self-realiza-
tion. Even the third-class devotee, who is not advanced in knowledge of the
Absolute Truth but simply offers obeisances with great devotion, thinks of
the Lord, sees the Lord in the temple and brings forth flowers and fruits
to offer to the Deity, becomes imperceptibly liberated. Sraddhayanvitah:
with great devotion the devotees offer worshipful respects and paraphernalia
to the Deity. The Deities of Radha and Krsna, Laksmi and Narayana, and
Rama and Sita are very attractive to devotees, so much so that when they
see the statue decorated in the temple of the Lord they become fully ab-
sorbed in thought of the Lord. That is the state of liberation. In other
words, it is confirmed herewith that even a third-class devotee is in the
transcendental position, above those who are trying for liberation by
speculation or by other methods. Even great impersonalists like Sukadeva
Gosvami and the four Kumaras were attracted by the beauty of the Deities
in the temple, by the decorations and by the aroma of tulasi offered to
the Lord, and they became devotees. Even though they were in the
liberated state, instead of remaining impersonalists they were attracted by
the beauty of the Lord and became devotees.

Here the word vilasa is very important. Vilasa means the activities or
pastimes of the Lord. It is a prescribed duty in temple worship that not
only should one visit the temple to see the Deity nicely decorated, but at
the same time he should hear the recitation of Srimad-Bhagavatam,
Bhagavad-gita or some similar literature, which is regularly recited in the
temple. It is the system in Vrndavana that in every temple there is recita-
tion of the sastras. Even third-class devotees who have no literary knowl-
edge or no time to read Srimad-Bhdgavatam or Bhagavad-gita get the
opportunity to hear about the pastimes of the Lord. In this way their
minds may remain always absorbed in the thought of the Lord—His form,
His activities and His transcendental nature. This state of Krsna conscious-
ness is a liberated stage. Lord Caitanya, therefore, recommended five
important processes in the discharge of devotional service: (1) to chant
the holy name of the Lord, Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare
Hare/ Ilare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, (2) to associate
with devotees and serve them as far as possible, (3) to hear Srimad-
Bhagavatam, (4) to see the decorated temple and the Deity, and, if
possible, (5) to live in a place like Vrndavana or Mathura. These five items
alone can help a devotee to achieve the highest perfectional stage. This is
confirmed in Bhagavad-gitd and herein the &rtmad Bhsgavatam. That third-

class devotees can also imperceptibly achieve liberation is accepted in all
Vedic literatures.

TRANSLATION
Thus because he is completely absorbed in thought of Me, the devotee
does not desire even the highest benediction obtainable in the upper
planetary systems, including Satyaloka. He does not desire the eight
material perfections obtained from mystic yoga, nor does he desire to be
elevated to the kingdom of God. Yet even without desiring them, the
devotee enjoys, even in this life, all the offered benedictions.
PURPORT
The vibhiiti or opulences offered by mdyd are of many varieties. We
have experience of different varieties of material enjoyment even on this
planet, but if one is able to promote himself to higher planets like Candra-
loka, the sun, or, still higher, Maharloka, Janaloka and Tapoloka, or even
ultimately the highest planet, which is inhabited by Brahma and is called
Satyaloka, there are immense possibilities for material enjoyment. For
example, the duration of life on higher planets is far, far greater than on


--- Page 49 ---
Text 38] The Glories of Devotional Service 1049
this planet. It is said that on the moon the duration of life is such that our
six months are equal to one day. We cannot even imagine the duration of
life on the highest planet. It is stated in Bhagavad-gitd that Brahma’s
twelve hours are inconceivable even to our mathematicians. These are all
descriptions of the external energy of the Lord, or mdya. Besides these,
there are other opulences which the yogis can achieve by their mystic
power. They are also material. A devotee does not aspire for all these
material pleasures, although they are available to him simply by wishing.
By the grace of the Lord, a devotee can achieve wonderful success simply
by willing. But a real devotee does not like that. Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu
has taught that one should not desire material opulence or material repu-
tation, nor should one try to enjoy material beauty; he should simply as-
pire to be absorbed in the devotional service of the Lord, even if he does
not get liberation but has to continue the process of birth and death
unlimitedly. Actually, however, to one who engages in Krsna conscious-
ness, liberation is already guaranteed. Devotees enjoy all the benefits of the
higher planets and the Vaikuntha planets also. It is especially mentioned
here, bhagavatir bhadram. In the Vaikuntha planets everything is eternally
peaceful, yet a pure devotee does not even aspire to be promoted there.
But still he gets that advantage; he enjoys all the facilities of the material
and spiritual worlds, even during the present life span.

TRANSLATION

The Lord continued: My dear mother, devotees who receive such
transcendental opulences are never bereft of them; neither weapons nor
the change of time can destroy such opulences. Because the devotees
accept Me as their friend, their relative, their son, preceptor, benefactor
and Supreme Deity, they cannot be deprived of their possessions at any
time.

PURPORT

It is stated in Bhagavad-gitd that one may elevate himself to the
higher planetary systems, even up to Brahmaloka, by dint of pious activi-
ties, but when the effects of such pious activities are finished, one again
comes back to this earth to begin a new life of activities. Thus even though
one is promoted to the higher planetary system for enjoyment and a long
duration of life, still that is not a permanent settlement. But as far as the
devotees are concerned, their assets—the achievement of devotional service
and the consequent opulence of Vaikuntha, even on this planet—are never
destroyed. In this verse Kapiladeva addresses His mother as santa-ripa,
indicating that the opulences of devotees are fixed because devotees are
eternally fixed in the Vaikuntha atmosphere, which is called s@nta-ripa
because it is in the mode of pure goodness, undisturbed by the modes of
passion and ignorance. Once one is fixed in the devotional service of the
Lord, his position of transcendental service cannot be destroyed, and the
pleasure and service simply increase unlimitedly. For the devotees engaged
in Krsna consciousness, in the Vaikuntha atmosphere, there is no influence
of time. In the material world the influence of time destroys everything,
but in the Vaikuntha atmosphere there is no influence of time or of the
demigods because there are no demigods in the Vaikuntha planets. Here
our activities are controlled by different demigods; even if we move our
hand and leg, the action is controlled by the demigods. But in the
Vaikuntha atmosphere there is no influence of the demigods or of time;
therefore there is no question of destruction. When the time element is
present, there is the certainty of destruction, but when there is no time
element, past, present or future, then everything is eternal. Therefore this
verse uses the words na naikgyanti, indicating that the transcendental
opulences will never be destroyed.

The reason for freedom from destruction is also described. The devotees
accept the Supreme Lord as the most dear personality and reciprocate
with Him in different relationships. They accept the Supreme Personality


--- Page 51 ---
Text 38] The Glories of Devotional Service 1051
of Godhead as the dearmost friend, the dearmost relative, the dearmost
son, the dearmost preceptor, the dearmost well-wisher or the dearmost
Deity. The Lord is eternal; therefore any relationship in which we accept
Him is also eternal. It is clearly confirmed herein that the relationships can-
not be destroyed, and therefore the opulences of those relationships are
never destroyed. Every living entity has the propensity to love someone.
We can see that if someone has no object of love, then generally he puts
his love in a pet animal like a cat or a dog. Thus the eternal propensity for
love in all living entities is always searching for a place to reside. From
this verse we can learn that we can love the Supreme Personality of God-
head as our dearmost object—as a friend, as a son, as a preceptor or as a
well-wisher—and there will be no cheating and no end to such love. We
shall eternally enjoy the relationship with the Supreme Lord in different
aspects. A special feature of this verse is the acceptance of the Supreme
Lord as the supreme preceptor. Bhagavad-gita is spoken directly by the
Supreme Lord, and Arjuna accepted Krsna as guru or spiritual master.
Similarly, we should accept only Krsna as the supreme spiritual master.

Krsna, of course, means Krsna and His confidential devotees; Krsna is
not alone. When we speak of Krsna, Krsna means Krsna in His name, in His
form, in His quality, in His abode, in His associates, etc. Krsna is never
alone because the devotees of Krsna are not impersonalists. For example,
a king is always associated with his secretary, his commander, his servant
and so much paraphernalia. As soon as we accept Krsna and His associates
as our preceptors, no ill effects can destroy our knowledge. In the material
world the knowledge which we acquire may change because of the in-
fluence of time, but nevertheless the conclusions received from Bhagavad-
gita, directly from the speeches of the Supreme Lord Krsna, can never
change. There is no use interpreting Bhagavad-gitd; it is eternal.

Krsna, the Supreme Lord, should be accepted as one’s best friend. He will
never cheat. He will always give His friendly advice and friendly protection to
the devotee. If Krsna is accepted as a son, He will never die. Here we have a
very loving son or child, but the father and mother, or those who are affec-
tionate towards him, always hope, “May my son not die.” But Krsna actually
never will die. Therefore those who accept Krsna or the Supreme Lord as
their son will never be bereft of their son. In many instances devotees have
accepted the Deity as a son. In Bengal there are many such instances, and
even after the death of the devotee, the Deity performed the sraddha cere-
mony for the father. The relationship is never destroyed. People are
accustomed to worship different forms of demigods, but in Bhagavad-gita
such a mentality is condemned; therefore one should be intelligent enough


--- Page 52 ---
1052 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 25
to worship only the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His different forms
such as Laksmi-Narayana, Sita-R ama and Radha-Krsna. Thus he will never be
cheated. By worshiping the demigods one may elevate himself to the
higher planets, but during the dissolution of the material world, the deity
and the abode of the deity will be destroyed. But one who worships the
Supreme Personality of Godhead is promoted to the Vaikuntha planet
where there is no influence of time, destruction or annihilation. The con-
clusion is that the time influence cannot act upon devotees who have
accepted the Supreme Personality of Godhead as everything.

Thus the devotee who worships Me, the all-pervading Lord of the
universe, in unflinching devotional service, gives up all aspirations to be


--- Page 53 ---
Texts 39-40] The Glories of Devotional Service 1053
promoted to heavenly planets or to become happy in this world with
wealth, children, cattle, home or anything in relationship with the body. I
take him to the other side of birth and death.

PURPORT

Unflinching devotional service, as described in these two verses, means
engaging oneself in full Krsna consciousness or devotional service, accept-
ing the Supreme Lord as all in all. Since the Supreme Lord is all-inclusive,
if anyone worships Him with unflinching faith, he has automatically
achieved all other opulences and performed all other duties. The Lord
promises herein that He takes His devotee to the other side of birth and
death. Lord Caitanya, therefore, recommended that one who aspires to go
beyond birth and death should have no material possessions. This means
that one should not try to be happy in this world or to be promoted to the
heavenly world, nor should he try for material wealth, children, houses or
cattle.

How liberation is imperceptibly achieved by a pure devotee and what the
symptoms are have been explained. For the conditioned soul there are two
statuses of living. One status is in this present life, and the other is our
preparation for the next life. If I am in the mode of goodness, then I may
be preparing for promotion to the higher planets, if I am in the mode of
passion then [ shall remain here in a society where activity is very promi-
nent, and if I am in the mode of ignorance I may be degraded to animal
life or a lower grade of human life. But for a devotee there is no concern
for this life or the next life because in any life he does not desire elevation
in material prosperity or a high-grade or low-grade 1106. He prays to the
Lord, “My dear Lord, it does not matter where I am born, but let me be
born, even as an ant, in the house of a devotee.” A pure devotee does not
pray to the Lord for liberation from this material bondage. Actually, the
pure devotee never thinks that he is fit for liberation. Considering his past
life and his mischievous activities, he thinks that he is fit to be sent to the
lowest region of hell. If in this life | am trying to become a devotee, this
does not mean that in my many past lives [ was one hundred percent pious.
That is not possible. A devotee, therefore, is always conscious of his real
position. Only by his full surrender to the Lord, by the Lord’sgrace, are
his sufferings made shorter. As stated in Bhagavad-gita, “‘Surrender unto
Me, and 1 will give you protection from all kinds of sinful reaction.” That
is His mercy. But this does not mean that one who has surrendered to the
lotus feet of the Lord has committed no misdeeds in his past life. A devotee
always prays, “For my misdeeds, may 1 be born again and again, but my


--- Page 54 ---
1054 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 25
only prayer is that I may not forget Your service.” The devotee has that
much mental strength, and he prays to the Lord: “May I be born again
and again, but let me be born in the home of Your pure devotee so that 1
may again get a chance to develop myself.”

A pure devotee is not anxious to elevate himself in his next birth. He
has already given up that sort of hope. In any life in which one is born, as
a householder, or even as an animal, he must have some children, some
resources or some possessions, but a devotee is not anxious to possess
anything. He is satisfied with whatever is obtainable by God’s grace. He is
not at all attached to improving his social status or improving the status of
education of his children. He is not neglectful—he is dutiful but he does
not spend too much time on the upliftment of temporary household or
social life. He fully engages in the service of the Lord and for other affairs
he simply spares as much time as absolutely necessary (yathartham
upayuiijatah). Such a pure devotee does not care for what is going to
happen in the next life or in this life; he does not care even for family,
children or society. He fully engages in the service of the Lord in Krsna
consciousness. lt is stated in Bhagavad-gita that without the knowledge of
the devotee, the Lord arranges for His devotee to be immediately
transferred to His transcendental abode just after leaving his body. After
quitting his body he does not go into the womb of another mother. The
ordinary common living entity, after death, is transferred to the womb of
another mother, according to his karma or activities, to take another type
of body. But as far as the devotee is concerned, he is at once transferred to
the spiritual world in the association of the Lord. That is the Lord’s
special mercy. How it is possible is explained in the following verses.
Because He is all-powerful, the Lord can do anything and everything. He
can excuse all sinful reactions. He can immediately transfer a person to
Vaikunthaloka. That is the inconceivable power of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, who is favorably disposed to the pure devotees.

TRANSLATION

The terrible fear of birth and death can never be forsaken by anyone
who resorts to any shelter other than Myself, for I am the almighty Lord,
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the original source of all creation,
and also the Supreme Soul of all souls.

PURPORT

Itis indicated herein that the cycle of birth and death cannot be stopped
unless one is a pure devotee of the Supreme Lord. It is said, harim vind
na srtim taranti. One cannot surpass the cycle of birth and death unless
one is favored by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The same concept
is confirmed herewith: one may take to the system of understanding the
Absolute Truth by one’s own imperfect sensual speculation, or one may try
to realize the self by the mystic yoga process; but whatever one may do,
unless he comes to the point of surrendering to the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, no process can give him liberation. One may ask if this means
that those who are undergoing so much penance and austerity by strictly
following the rules and regulations are endeavoring in vain. The answer is
given by Srimad-Bhdgavatam (10.2.32): ye ‘nye ’ravinddksa vimukta-
madninah. Lord Brahma and other demigods prayed to the Lord when Krsna
was in the womb of Devaki: “My dear lotus-eyed Lord, there are persons
who are puffed up with the thought that they have become liberated or one
with God or have become God, but in spite of thinking in such a puffed-up
way, their intelligence is not laudable. They are less intelligent.” It is stated
that their intelligence, whether high or low, is not even purified. In
purified intelligence a living entity cannot think otherwise than to surren-
der. Bhagavad-gitd, therefore, confirms that purified intelligence arises in
the person of a very wise man. Bah@indri janmanam ante jiidnavan mdr
prapadyate. After many, many births, one who is actually advanced in
intelligence surrenders unto the Supreme Lord.

Without the surrendering process, one cannot achieve liberation. The
Bhagavatam says, “Those who are simply puffed up, thinking themselves
liberated by some nondevotional process, are not polished or clear in
intelligence because they have not yet surrendered unto You. In spite of
executing all kinds of austerities and penances or even arriving at the


--- Page 56 ---
1056 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 25
brink of spiritual realization in Brahman realization, they think that they
are in the effulgence of Brahman. But actually, because they have no
transcendental activities, they fall down to material activities.” One should
not be satisfied simply with knowing that he is Brahman. He must engage
himself in the service of the Supreme Brahman; that is bhakti. The
engagement of Brahman should be the service of Parabrahman. It is said
that unless one becomes Brahman one cannot serve Brahman. The Supreme
Brahman is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the living entity is
also Brahman. Without realization that he is Brahman, spirit soul, an eternal
servitor of the Lord, if one simply thinks that he is Brahman, then that is
only theoretical. He has to realize and at the same time engage himself in
the devotional service of the Lord; then he can exist in the Brahman sta-
tus. Otherwise he falls down.

The Bhagavatam says that because nondevotees neglect the transcenden-
tal loving service of the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead, their
intelligence is not sufficient, and therefore these persons fall down. The
living entity must have some activity. If he does not engage in the activity
of transcendental service, he must fall down to material activity. As soon
as one falls down to material activity, there is no rescue from the cycle of
birth and death. It is stated here by Lord Kapila, “Without My mercy”
(nanyatra mad bhagavatah). The Lord is stated here to be Bhagavan, the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, indicating that He is full of all opulences
and is therefore perfectly competent to deliver one from the cycle of
birth and death. He is also called pradhana because He is the Supreme. He
is equal to everyone, but to one who surrenders to Him He is especially
favorable. It is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita that the Lord is equal to
everyone; no one is His enemy and no one is His friend. But to one who
surrenders unto Him, He is especially inclined. By the grace of the Lord,
simply by surrendering unto Him one can get out of this cycle of birth and
death. Otherwise, he may go on in many, many lives and may many times
attempt other processes for liberation.

It is because of My supremacy that the wind blows, out of fear of Me;
the sun shines out of fear of Me, and the lord of the clouds, Indra, sends
forth showers out of fear of Me. Fire burns out of fear of Me, and
death goes about taking its toll out of fear of Me.

PURPORT

The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, says in Bhagavad-gitd that
the natural laws being enacted are correct in all activities because of His
superintendence. No one should think that nature is working automati-
cally, without superintendence. The Vedic literature says that the clouds
are controlled by the demigod Indra, heat is distributed by the sun-god,
the soothing moonlight is distributed by Candra, and the air is blowing
under the arrangement of the demigod Vayu. But above all these demigods,
the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the chief living entity.
Nityo nityanan cetanas cetananam. The demigods are also ordinary living
entities, but due to their faithfulness—their devotional service attitude—
they have been promoted to such posts. These different demigods, or
directors, such as Candra, Varuna and Vayu, are called adhikdri-devata. The
demigods are departmental heads. The government of the Supreme Lord
consists not only of one planet or two or three; there are millions of
planets and millions of universes. The Supreme Personality of Godhead has a
huge government, and He requires assistants. The demigods are considered
His bodily limbs. These are the descriptions of Vedic literature. Under
these circumstances, the sun-god, the moon-god, the fire-god and the air-
god are working under the direction of the Supreme Lord. It is confirmed
in the Bhagavad-gitd, mayddhyaksena prakrtih sayate sa-caracaram. The
natural laws are being conducted under His superintendence. Because He
is in the background, everything is being performed so punctually and
regularly.


--- Page 58 ---
1058 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 25
One who has taken shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is
completely protected from all other influences. He no longer serves or is
obliged to anyone else. Of course he is not disobedient to anyone, but his
full power of thought is absorbed in the service of the Lord. The state-
ments by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kapila, that under His
direction the air is blowing, the fire is burning, the sun is giving heat, etc.,
are not sentimental. The impersonalist may say that the Bhagavatam
devotees create and imagine someone as the Supreme Personality of God-
head and assign qualifications to Him;but actually it is neither imagination
nor an imposition of artificial power in the name of Godhead. In the Vedas
it is said, bhisasmad vdtah pavate/ bhisodeti siuryah: “By fear of the
Supreme Lord the wind-god and the sun-god are acting.” Bhisasmad agnis
cendras ca/ mrtyur dhdvati paficamah: ‘Agni, Indra, and Mrtyu are also
acting under His direction.” These are the statements of the Vedas.

PURPORT
One who actually wants to be liberated from the entanglement of this
material world and go back home, back to Godhead, is the mystic yogi.


--- Page 59 ---
Text 44] The Glories of Devotional Service 1059
The words explicitly used here are yuktena bhakti-yogena. Those yogis or
mystics who engage in devotional service are the first-class yogis. The first-
class yogis, as described in Bhagavad-gitd, are those who are constantly
thinking of the Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna. These
yogis are not without knowledge and renunciation. To become a bhakti-
yogi means to automatically attain knowledge and renunciation. That is
the consequent result of bhakti-yoga. In the Bhagavatam, First Canto,
Second Chapter it is also confirmed that one who engages in devotional
service of Vasudeva, Krsna, has complete transcendental knowledge and
renunciation, and there is no explanation for these attainments. Ahaituki—
without reason, they come. Even if a person is completely illiterate, simply
because of his engagement in devotional service, the transcendental
knowledge of the scriptures is revealed unto him. That is also stated in the
Vedic literature. To anyone who has full faith in the Supreme Personality
of Godhead and the spiritual master, all the import of the Vedic literatures
is revealed. He doesn’t have to seek separately; the yogis who engage in
devotional service are full in knowledge and renunciation. If there is a lack
of knowledge and renunciation, it is to be understood that he is not in full
devotional service. The conclusion is that one cannot be sure of entrance
into the spiritual realm—in either the impersonal brahmajyoti effulgence
of the Lord or the Vaikuntha planets within that Brahman effulgence—
unless he is surrendered unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord. The
surrendered souls are called akuto-bhaya. They are doubtless and fearless,
and their entrance into the spiritual kingdom is guaranteed.

TRANSLATION

Therefore persons whose minds are fixed on the Lord engage in the
intensive practice of devotional service. That is the only means for
attainment of the final perfection of life.

PURPORT

Here the words mano mayy arpitam, which mean “the mind being fixed
on Me,” are significant. One should fix his mind on the lotus feet of Krsna
or any incarnation. To be fixed steadily in that freedom is the way of
liberation. Ambarigsa Maharaja is an example. He fixed his mind on the
lotus feet of the Lord, he spoke only on the pastimes of the Lord, he
smelled only the flowers and tulasi offered to the Lord, he walked only to
the temple of the Lord, he engaged his hands in cleansing the temple, he
engaged his tongue in tasting the foodstuff offered to the Lord, and he
engaged his ears for hearing the great pastimes of the Lord. In that way all
his senses were engaged. First of all, the mind should be engaged at the
lotus feet of the Lord, very steadily and naturally. Because the mind is the
master of the senses, when the mind is engaged, all the senses become
engaged. That is bhakti-yoga. Yoga means controlling the senses. The
senses cannot be controlled in the proper sense of the term; they are
always agitated. This is true also with a child—how long can he be forced
to sit down silently? It is not possible. Even Arjuna said, caiicalari hi
manah krspa: “The mind is always agitated.” The best course is to fix the
mind on the lotus feet of the Lord. Mano mayy arpitari sthiram. If one
seriously engages in Krsna consciousness, that is the highest perfectional
stage. All Krsna conscious activities are on the highest perfectional level of
human life.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Third Canto, Twenty-fifth
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “The Glories of Devotional
Service.”

The Personality of Godhead, Kapila, continued: My dear mother, now
I shall describe unto you the different categories of the Absolute Truth,

modes of material nature.
PURPORT
As stated in Bhagavad-gita, one can understand the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, only through devotional service
(bhaktya mam abhijandti). As stated in the Bhagavatam, the object of
devotional service is mam, Krsna. And, as explained in the Caitanya-
caritamrta, to understand षव means to understand Krgpa in His
1061

1062 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 26
personal form with His internal energy, His external energy, His expansions
and His incarnations. There are many diverse departments of knowledge in
understanding Krsna. Sankhya philosophy is especially meant for persons
who are conditioned by this material world. It is generally understood by
the parampara system, or by disciplic succession, to be the science of
devotional service. Preliminary studies of devotional service have already
been explained. Now the analytical study of devotional service will be
explained by the Lord, who says that by such an analytical study, one
becomes freed from the modes of material nature. The same assertion is
confirmed in Bhagavad-gita. Tato mam tattvato jiiatva: By understanding
the Lord according to various categories, one can become cligible to enter
into the kingdom of God. This is also explained here. By understanding
the science of devotional service in sarnkhya philosophy, one can become
free from the modes of material nature. The eternal self, after becoming
freed from the spell of material nature, becomes eligible to enter into the
kingdom of God. As long as one has even a slight desire to enjoy or lord
it over material nature, there is no chance of his being freed from the
influence of nature’s material modes. Therefore, one has to understand
the Supreme Personality of Godhead analytically, as explained in the
sarikhya system of philosophy by Lord Kapiladeva.

Text 3] Fundamental Principles of Material Nature 1063
PURPORT

It is said that by proper understanding of the pure self, or by self-
realization, one can be freed from material attachment. Knowledge
leads one to attain the ultimate perfection of life and to see oneself as he
is. The Svetdsvatara Upanisad (3.8) also confirms this. Tam eva viditvati-
mrtyum eti: Simply by understanding one’s spiritual position or by seeing
oneself as he is, one can be freed from material entanglement. In various
ways, the seeing of oneself is described in the Vedic literatures, and it is con-
firmed in the Bhagavatam (purusasya atma-darsanam) that one has to see
oneself and know what he is. As Kapiladeva explains to His mother, this
“seeing” can be done by hearing from the proper authoritative source.
Kapiladeva is the greatest authority because He is the Personality of
Godhead, and if someone accepts whatever is explained as it is, without
interpretation, then he can see himself.

Lord Caitanya explained to Sanatana Gosvami the real constitutional
position of the individual. He said directly that each and every individual
soul is eternally a servilor of Krsna. Jivera ‘svaripa’ haya—krsnera ‘nitya-
dasa’: Every individual soul is eternally a servitor. When one is fixed in the
understanding that he is parl and parcel of the Supreme Soul and thal his
eternal position is (0 serve in association with the Supreme Lord, he becomes
self-realized. This position of understanding oneself rightly cuts the knot
of material attraction (hrdaya-granthi-bhedanam). Due to false ego
or false identification of oneself with the body and the material world,
one is entrapped by maya, but as soon as one understands that he is
qualitatively the same substance as the Supreme Lord because he belongs
to the same category of spiril soul and that his perpetual position is to
serve, this is «tma-darsanam and hrdaya-granthi-bhedanam, self-realization.
When one can cut the knot of attachment to the material world, his under-
standing is called knowledge. Atma-darsanam means to see oneself by
knowledge; therefore, when one is freed from the false ego by the cultiva-
tion of real knowledge, he sees himself, and that is the ultimate necessity
of human life. The soul is thus isolated from the entanglement of the
twenty-four categories of material nature. Pursuit of the systematic philo-
sophic process called sanikhya is called knowledge and self-revelation.

TRANSLATION

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the Supreme Soul, and He has
no beginning. He is transcendental to the material modes of nature and
beyond the existence of this material world. He is perceivable everywhere
because He is self-effulgent, and by His self-effulgent luster the entire
creation is maintained.

PURPORT

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is described as being without
beginning. 116 is purusa, the Supreme Spirit. Purusa means person. When
we think of a person in our present experience, that person has a begin-
ning. This means that he has taken birth and that there is a history from
the beginning of his life. Bul the Lord is particularly mentioned here as
anadi, beginningless. If we examine all persons, we will find that everyone
has a beginning, but when we approach a person who has no beginning, 116
is the Supreme Person. That is the definition given in the Brahma-sanihita.
I$varah paramah krspah: The Supreme Personality of Godhead is Krsna,
the supreme controller; He is without beginning, and He is the beginning
of everyone. This definition is found in all Vedic literatures.

The Lord is described as the soul or spirit. What is the definition of
spirit? Spirit is perceivable everywhere. Brahman means great. His greatness
is perceived everywhere. And what is that greatness? Consciousness. We
have personal experience of consciousness, for it is spread all over the
body; in every hair follicle of our body we can feel consciousness. This is
individual consciousness. Similarly, there is Superconsciousness. The
example can be given of a small light and the sunlight. The sunlight is
perceived everywhere, even within the room or in the sky, but the small
light is experienced within a specific limit. Similarly, our consciousness is


--- Page 65 ---
Text 3] Fundamental Principles of Material Nature 1065
perceived within the limit of our particular body, but the Superconscious-
ness, or the existence of God, is perceived everywhere. He is present
everywhere by His energy. It is stated in the Vispu Purana that whatever
we find, anywhere and everywhere, is the distribution of the energy of the
Supreme Lord. In Bhagavad-gita also it is confirmed that the Lord is all-
pervading and exists everywhere by His two kinds of energy, one spiritual
and the other material. Both the spiritual and material energies are spread
everywhere, and that is the proof of the existence of the Supreme Person-
ality of Godhead.

The existence of consciousness everywhere is not temporary. It is
without beginning. And because it is without beginning, it is also without
end. The theory that consciousness develops at a certain stage of material
combination is not accepted herein, for the consciousness which exists
everywhere is said to be without beginning. The materialistic or atheistic
theory stating that there is no soul, that there is no God, and that
consciousness is the result of a combination of matter is not acceptable.
Matter is not beginningless; it has a beginning. As this material body has a
beginning, so the universal body does also. And as our material body has
begun on the basis of our soul, similarly, the entire gigantic universal body
has begun on the basis of the Supreme Soul. The Vedanta-sittra says,
janmady asya. This entire material exhibition—its creation, its growth, its
maintenance, and its dissolution—is an emanation from the Supreme
Person. In Bhagavad-gita also, the Lord says, “1 am the beginning and the
source of birth of everything.”

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is described here. He is not a
temporary person, nor does He have a beginning. He is without a cause,
and He is the cause of all causes. Parah means transcendental, beyond the
creative energy. The Lord is the creator of the creative energy. We can see
that there is a creative energy in the material world, but He is not under
this energy. He is prakrti-parah, beyond this energy. He is not subjected to
the threefold miseries created by the material energy because He is beyond
it. The modes of material nature do not touch Him. 1t is explained here,
svayam-jyoti: He is light Himself. We have experience in the material world
of one light’s being a reflection of another, just as moonlight is a reflection
of the sunlight. Sunlight is also the reflection of the brahmajyoti. Similarly,
brahmajyoti, the spiritual effulgence, is a reflection of the body of the
Supreme Lord. This is confirmed in the Brahma-sarihita: yasya prabha
prabhavatah. The brahmajyoti, or Brahman effulgence, is due to His bodily
luster. Therefore it is said here, svayam-jyoti: He Himself is light. His light
is distributed in different ways, as the brahmajyoti, as sunlight and as


--- Page 66 ---
1066 Srimad-Bhagavatam [ Canto 3, Ch. 26
moonlight. Bhagavad-gita confirms that in the spiritual world there is no
need of sunlight, moonlight or electricity. The Upanisads also confirm
this; because the bodily luster of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is
sufficient to illuminate the spiritual world, there is no need of sunlight,
moonlight or any other light or electricity. This self-illumination also
contradicts the theory that the spirit soul or the spiritual consciousness
develops at a certain point in material combination. The term svayari-
Jyoti indicates that there is no tinge of anything material or any material
reaction. Itis confirmed here that the concept of the Lord’s all-pervasiveness
is due to His illumination everywhere. We have experience that the
sun is situated in one place, bul the sunlight is diffused all around
for millions and millions of miles. That is our practical experience.
Similarly, although the supreme light is situated in His personal abode,
Vaikuntha or Vrndavana, His light is diffused not only in the spiritual
world but beyond that. In the material world also, that light is reflected
to the sun globe, and the sunlight is reflected by the moon globe. Thus
although He is situated in His own abode, His light is distributed all over
the spiritual and material worlds. The Brahma-samhita confirms this (Bs.
5.37). Goloka eva nivasaty akhilatma-bhutah: He is living in Goloka, but
still He is present all over the creation. He is the Supersoul of everything,
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He has innumerable transcen-
dental qualities. It is also concluded that although He is undoubtedly a
person, He is not a purusa of this material world. Mayavadi philosophers
cannot understand that beyond this material world there can be a person;
therefore they are impersonalists. But it is explained very nicely here that
the Personality of Godhead is beyond material existence.

TRANSLATION

As His pastime, that Supreme Personality of Godhead, the greatest of
the great, accepted the subtle material energy, which is invested with three
material modes of nature and which is related with Vignu.

PURPORT

In this verse the word guramayim is very significant. Daivim means
“the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,” and gunamayim
means ‘‘invested with the three modes of material nature.” When the
material energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears, this
gunamayim energy acts as a manifestation of the energies of the three
modes; it acts as a covering. The energy emanated from the Supreme
Personality of Godhead manifests in two ways—as an emanation from the
Supreme Lord and as a covering of the Lord’s face. In Bhagavad-gita it is
said that the whole world is illusioned by the three modes of material
nature, and thus the common conditioned soul, being covered by such
energy, cannot see the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The example of a
cloud is very nicely given. All of a sudden there may appear a big cloud in
the sky. This cloud is perceived in two ways. To the sun the cloud is a
creation of its energy, but to the ordinary common man in the conditioned
state, it is a covering to the eyes; because of the cloud, the sun cannot be
seen. It is not that the sun is actually covered by the cloud; only the
vision of the ordinary being is covered. Similarly, although maya cannot
cover the Supreme Lord, who is beyond maya, the material energy covers
the ordinary living entities. Those conditioned souls who are covered are
individual living entities, and He from whose energy maya is created is the
Supreme Personality of Godhead.

In another place in the Srimad-Bhagavatam, in the First Canto, Seventh
Chapter, it is stated that by his spiritual vision Vyasadeva saw the Supreme
Lord and the material energy standing behind Him. This indicates that
material energy cannot cover the Lord, just as darkness cannot cover the
sun. Darkness can cover a jurisdiction which is very insignificant in com-
parison to that of the sun. Darkness can cover a small cave, but not the
open sky. Similarly, the covering capacity of the material energy is limited
and cannot act on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is therefore
called vibhu. As the appearance of a cloud is accepted by the sun, so the


--- Page 68 ---
1068 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 26
appearance of the material energy at a certain interval is accepted by the
Lord. Although His material energy is utilized to create the material
world, this does not mean that lle is covered by that energy. Those who
are covered by the material energy are called conditioned souls. The Lord
accepts the material energy for His material pastimes in creation, mainte-
nance and dissolution. But the conditioned soul is covered; he cannot
understand that beyond this material energy there is the Supreme Person-
ality of Godhead who is the cause of all causes, just as a less intelligent
person cannot understand that beyond the covering of the clouds there
is bright sunshine.

TRANSLATION
Divided into varieties by her threefold modes, material nature creates
the forms of the living entities, and the living entities, seeing this, are
illusioned by the knowledge-covering feature of the illusory energy.
PURPORT
Material energy has the power to cover knowledge, but this covering
cannot be applied to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is applicable
only to the prajah, or those who are born with material bodies, the
conditioned souls. The different kinds of living entities vary according
to the modes of material nature, as explained in Bhagavad-gita and other
Vedic literature. In Bhagavad-gita (7.12) it is very nicely explained that
although the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance are born of the


--- Page 69 ---
Text 5] Fundamental Principles of Material Nature 1069
Supreme Personality of Godhead, He is not subject to them. In other
words, the energy emanating from the Supreme Personality of Godhead
cannot act on Him; it acts on the conditioned souls who are covered by
the material energy. The Lord is the father of all living entities because He
impregnates material energy with the conditioned souls. Therefore, the
conditioned souls get bodies created by the material energy, whereas the
father of the living entities is aloof from the three modes.

It is stated in the previous verse that the material energy was accepted
by the Supreme Personality of Godhead in order that He might exhibit
pastimes for the living entities who wanted to enjoy and lord it over the
material energy. This world was created through the material energy of
the Lord for the so-called enjoyment of such living entities. Why this
material world was created for the sufferings of the conditioned souls is a
very intricate question. There is a hint here in the word lilaya, which means
for the pastimes of the Lord. The Lord wants to rectify the enjoying
temperament of the conditioned souls. It is stated in Bhagavad-gita that
no one is the enjoyer but the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This
material energy is created, therefore, for anyone who pretends to enjoy.
An example can be cited here that there is no necessity for the govern-
ment’s creation of a separate police department, but because it is a fact
that some of the citizens will not accept the state laws, a department to
deal with criminals is necessary. There is no necessity, but at the same
time there is a necessity. Similarly, there was no necessity to create this
material world for the sufferings of the conditioned souls, but at the same
time there are certain living entities known as nitya-baddha who are
eternally conditioned. We say that they have been conditioned from time
immemorial because no one can trace out when the living entity, the part
and parcel of the Supreme Lord, became rebellious against the supremacy
of the Lord.

It is a fact that there are two classes of men—those who are obedient to
the laws of the Supreme Lord, and those who are atheists or agnostics,
who do not accept the existence of God and who want to create their own
laws. They want to establish that everyone can create his own laws or his
own religious path. Without tracing out the beginning of the existence of
these two classes, we can take it for granted that some of the living entities
revolted against the laws of the Lord. Such entities are called conditioned
souls, for they are conditioned by the three modes of material nature.
Therefore the words gunair vicitrah are used here.

In this material world there are 8,400,000 species of life. As spirit souls,
they are all transcendental to this material world. Why, then, do they


--- Page 70 ---
1070 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 26
exhibit themselves in different stages of life? The answer is given here:
they are under the spell of the three modes of material nature. Because
they were created by the material energy, their bodies are made of the
material elements. Covered by the material body, the spiritual identity is
lost, and therefore the word mumuhe is used here, indicating that they
have forgotten their own spiritual identity. This forgetfulness of spiritual
identity is present in the jivas, the conditioned souls who are subject to
be covered by the energy of material nature. Jiidna-giihaya is another word
used. Giha means covering. Because the knowledge of the minute condi-
tioned souls is covered, they are exhibited in so many species of life. It is
said in the Srimad-Bhagavatam, Seventh Chapter, First Canto, “The
living entities are illusioned by the material energy.” In the Vedas also it
is stated that the eternal living entities are covered by different modes and
that they are called tri-colored—red, white and blue—living entities. Red is
the representation of the mode of passion, white is the representation of
the mode of goodness, and blue is the representation of the modc of
ignorance. These modes of material nature belong to the material energy,
and therefore the living entities under these different modes of material
nature have different kinds of material bodies. Because they are forgetful
of their spiritual identities, they think the material bodies to be themselves.
To the conditioned soul, “me” means the material body. This is called
moha, or bewilderment.

It is repeatedly said in the Katha Upanisad that the Supreme Personality
of Godhead is never affected by the influence of material nature. It is,
rather, the conditioned souls or the minute infinitesimal parts and parcels
of the Supreme who are affected by the influence of material nature and
who appear in different bodies under the material modes.

TRANSLATION
Due to his forgetfulness, the transcendental living entity accepts the
influence of material energy as his field of activities, and, thus actuated,
he wrongly applies the activities to himself.
PURPORT
The forgetful living entity can be compared to a man who is under the
influence of disease and has become mad, or to a man haunted by ghosts
who acts without control and yet thinks himself to be in control.
Under the influence of material nature, the conditioned soul becomes
absorbed in material consciousness. In this consciousness, whatever is done
under the influence of the material energy is accepted by the conditioned
soul as self-actuated. Actually, the soul in his pure state of existence
should be in Krsna consciousness. When a person is not acting in Krsna
consciousness he is understood to be acting in material consciousness.
Consciousness cannot be killed because the symptom of the living entity
is consciousness. The material consciousness simply has to be purified.
One becomes liberated by accepting Krsna, or the Supreme Lord, as
master and by changing the mode of consciousness from material con-
sciousness to Krsna consciousness.

TRANSLATION

Material consciousness is the cause of one’s conditional life. Conditions
are enforced upon the living entity by the material energy. Although he
does not do anything and is transcendental to such activities, the spirit
soul is thus affected by conditional life.

PURPORT

The Mayavadi philosopher, who does not differentiate between the
Supreme Spirit and the individual spirit, says that the conditional existence
of the living entity is his lila, or pastime. But the word “pastime” implies
employment in the activities of the Lord. The Mayavadis misuse the word
and say that even if the living entity has become a stool-eating hog, he is
also enjoying his pastimes. This is a most dangerous interpretation. Actually
the Supreme Lord is the leader and maintainer of all living entities. His
pastimes are transcendental to any material activity. Such pastimes of the
Lord cannot be dragged to the level of the conditional activities of the
living entities. In conditional life the living entity actually remains as if a
captive in the hands of material energy. Whatever the material energy
dictates, the conditioned soul does. He has no responsibility; he is simply
the witness of the action, but he is forced to act in that way due to his
offense in his eternal relationship with Krsna. Lord Krsna therefore says
in Bhagavad-gita that maya, His material energy, is so forceful that it is
insurmountable. But if a living entity simply understands that his
constitutional position is to serve Krsna and he tries to act on this principle,
then however conditioned he may be, the influence of maya immediately
vanishes. This is clearly stated in Bhagavad-gita, Seventh Chapter: Krsna
takes charge of anyone who surrenders to Him in helplessness, and thus
the influence of maya, or conditional life, is removed.

The spirit soul is actually sac-cid-ananda—eternal, full of bliss and full
of knowledge. Under the clutches of maya, however, he suffers from con-
tinued birth, death, disease and old age. One has to be serious to cure this
condition of material existence and transfer himself to Krsna conscious-
ness, for thus his long suffering may be mitigated without difficulty. In
summary, the suffering of the conditioned soul is due to his attachment to
material nature. This attachment should thus be transferred from matter
to Krsna.

TRANSLATION

The cause of the conditioned soul’s material body and senses, and the
senses’ presiding deities, the demigods, is the material nature. This is
understood by learned men. The feelings of happiness and distress of the
soul, who is transcendental by nature, are caused by the spirit soul
himself.

PURPORT

In Bhagavad -gita it is said that when the Lord descends to this material
world, He comes as a person by His own energy, atma-maya. He is not
forced by any superior energy. He comes by His own will, and this can be
called His pastime or lila. But here it is clearly stated that the conditioned
soul is forced lo take a certain type of body and senses under the three
modes of material nature. That body is not received according Lo his own
choice. In other words, a conditioned soul has no free choice; he has
to accept a certain lype of body according to his karma. But
when there are bodily reactions as felt in happiness and distress, it is to be
understood that the cause is the spirit soul himself. If he so desires, the
spirit soul can change this conditional life of dualities by choosing to
serve Krsna. The living entity is the cause of his own suffering, but he can
also be the cause of his eternal happiness. When he wants to engage in
Krsna consciousness, a suitable body is offered to him by the internal
potency or spiritual energy of the Lord, and when he wants to salisfy his
senses, a malerial body is offered. Thus it is his free choice to accept a
spiritual body or a material body, but once the body is accepted he has to
enjoy or suffer the consequences. The Mayavadi philosopher’s presentation
is that the living entity enjoys his pastimes by accepting the body of a
hog. This theory is nol acceptable, however, because the word “pastime”
implies voluntary acceptance for enjoyment. Therefore this interpretation
is most misleading. When there is enforced acceptance for suffering, it is not


--- Page 74 ---
1074 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 26
a pastime. The Lord’s pastimes and the conditioned living entity’s
acceptance of karmic reaction are not on the same level.

TRANSLATION

Devahiiti said: O Supreme Personality of Godhead, kindly explain the
characteristics of the Supreme Person and His energies because both of
these are the causes of this manifest and unmanifest creation.

PURPORT

Prakrti, or material nature, is connected with both the Supreme Lord
and the living entities, just as a woman is connected with her husband as a
wife and with her children as a mother. In Bhagavad-gita the Lord says
that He impregnates mother nature with children, living entities, and
thereafter all species of living entities become manifest. The relationship
of all living entities with material nature has been explained. Now an
understanding of the relationship between material nature and the Supreme
Lord is sought by Devahati. The product of that relationship is stated to
be the manifest and unmanifest material world. The unmanifest material


--- Page 75 ---
Text 9] Fundamental Principles of Material Nature 1075
world is the subtle mahat-tattva, and from that mahat-tattva the material
manifestation has emerged.

In the Vedic literatures it is said that by the glance of the Supreme
Lord the total material energy is impregnated, and then everything
is born of material nature. It is also confirmed in the Ninth Chapter of
Bhagavad-gita that under His glance, adhyaksepa—under His direction and
by His will-nature is working. It is not that nature works blindly. After
understanding the position of the conditioned souls in relation to material
nature, Devahiuiti wanted to know how nature works under the direction of
the Lord and what the relationship is between the material nature and the
Lord. In other words, she wanted to learn the characteristics of the
Supreme Lord in relation to the material nature.

The relationship of the living entities with matter and that of the
Supreme Lord with matter are certainly not on the same level, although
the Mayavadis may interpret it in that way. When it is said that the living
entities are bewildered, the Mayavadi philosophers ascribe this bewilder-
ment to the Supreme Lord. But that is not applicable. The Lord is never
bewildered. That is the difference between personalists and impersonalists.
Devahiiti is not unintelligent. She has enough intelligence to understand
that the living entities are not on the level of the Supreme Lord. Because
the living entities are minute and infinitesimal, they become bewildered or
conditioned by material nature, but this does not mean that the Supreme
Lord is also conditioned or bewildered. The difference between the
conditioned soul and the Lord is that the Lord is the Lord, the master of
material nature, and He is therefore not subject to its control. He is con-
trolled neither by spiritual nature nor by material nature. He is the supreme
controller Himself, and He cannot be compared to the ordinary living
entities who are controlled by the laws of material nature.

Two words used in this verse are sat and asat. The cosmic manifestation
is asat—it does not exist—but the material energy of the Supreme Lord is
sat, or ever-existing. Material nature is ever-existing in its subtle form as
the energy of the Lord, but it sometimes manifests this nonexistent or
temporarily existent nature, the cosmos. An analogy may be made with
the father and mother: the mother and the father exist, but sometimes the
mother begets children. Similarly, this cosmic manifestation which comes
from the unmanifest material nature of the Supreme Lord sometimes
appears and again disappears. But the material nature is ever-existing, and
the Lord is the supreme cause for both the subtle and gross manifestations
of this material world.

TRANSLATION
The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: The unmanifested eternal
combination of the three modes is the cause of the manifest state and is
called pradhana. It is called prakrti when in the manifested stage of
existence.
PURPORT
The Lord points out material nature in its subtle stage, which is called
pradhdna, and He analyzes this pradhana. The explanation of pradhana
and prakrti is that pradhana is the subtle, undifferentiated sum total of all
material elements. Although they are undifferentiated, one can understand
that the total material elements are contained therein. When the total
material elements are manifested by the interaction of the three modes of
material nature, the manifestation is called prakrti. Impersonalists say that
Brahman is without variegatedness and without differentiation. One may
say that pradhana is the Brahman stage, but actually the Brahman stage is
not pradhana. Pradhana is distinct from Brahman because in Brahman
there is no existence of the material modes of nature. One may argue that
the mahat-tattva is also different from pradhana because in the mahat-
tattva there are manifestations. The actual explanation of pradhana, how-
ever, is given here: when the cause and effect are not clearly manifested
(avyaktam), the reaction of the total elements does not take place, and


--- Page 77 ---
Text 11] Fundamental Principles of Material Nature 1077
that is called pradhana. Pradhana is not the time element because in the
time element there are actions and reactions, creation and annihilation.
Nor is it the jiva or marginal potency of living entities, or designated,
conditioned living entities, because the designations of the living entities
are not eternal. One adjective used in this connection is nitya, which
indicates eternality. Therefore the condition of material nature immedi-
ately previous to its manifestation is called pradhana.

The aggregate elements, namely the five gross elements, the five subtle
elements, the four internal senses, the five senses for gathering knowledge
and the five outward organs of action, are known as the pradhana.

PURPORT

According to Bhagavad-gita, the sum total of the twenty-four elements
described herein is called the yonir mahad-brahma. The sum total
of the living entities is impregnated in this yonir mahad-brahma, and they
are born in different forms, beginning from Brahma down to the
insignificant ant. In the Srimad-Bhagavatam and other Vedic literatures,
the sum total of the twenty-four elements, pradhana, is also described as
yonir mahad-brahma; it is the source of the birth and subsistence of all
living entities.

The internal subtle senses are experienced as having four aspects in the
shape of mind, intelligence, ego and contaminated consciousness. Distinc-
tions between them can be made only by different functions, since they
represent different characteristics.
PURPORT
The four internal senses or subtle senses described herein are defined
by different characteristics. When pure consciousness is polluted by
material contamination, and identification with the body becomes
prominent, this is called false ego. Consciousness is the function of the
soul, and therefore behind consciousness there is soul. When consciousness
is polluted by material contamination, this is called ahankara.

Sarva khalv idarih brahma (Chand. Up. 3.14.1). It is stated also in the Visnu
Purana that whatever we see 15 parasya brahmanah saktih; everything is an
expansion of the energy of the Supreme Absolute Truth, Brahman. When
Brahman is mixed with the three qualities of goodness, passion and
ignorance, there results the material expansion, which is sometimes
called saguna Brahman and which consists of these twenty-five elements.
In the nirgupe Brahman, where there is no material contamination, or in
the spiritual world, the three modes—goodness, passion and ignorance—
are not present. Where nirguna Brahman is found, simple unalloyed good-
ness prevails. Saguna Brahman is described by the sankhya system of
philosophy as consisting of twenty-five elements, including the time
factor (past, present and future).

TRANSLATION

The influence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is felt in the time
factor, which causes fear of death due to the false ego of the deluded soul
who has contacted material nature.

PURPORT

The living entity’s fear of death is due to his false ego of identifying with
the body. Everyone is afraid of death. Actually there is no death for the
spirit soul, but due to our absorption in the identification of body as self,
the fear of death develops. It is also stated in the Srimad-Bhagavatam
(Bhag. 11.2.37), bhayari dvitiyabhinivesatah syat. Dvitiya means matter,
which is beyond spirit. Matter is the secondary manifestation of spirit, for
matter is produced from spirit. Just as the material elements described
are caused by the Supreme Lord, the Supreme Spirit, the body is also a
product of the spirit soul. Therefore, the material body is called dvitiya,
or “the second.” One who is absorbed in this second element or second
exhibition of the spirit is afraid of death. When one is fully convinced that
he is not his body, there is no question of fearing death, since the spirit
soul does not die.

If the spirit soul engages in the spiritual activities of devotional service,
he is completely freed from the platform of birth and death. His next
position is complete spiritual freedom from a material body. The fear of
death is the action of the kala, or the time factor, which represents the
influence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In other words, time is
destructive. Whatever is created is subject to destruction and dissolution,
which is the action of time. Time is a representation of the Lord, and it
reminds us also that we must surrender unto the Lord. The Lord speaks
to every conditioned soul as time. He says in Bhagavad-gita that if someone
surrenders unto Him, then there is no longer any problem of birth and
death. We should therefore accept the time factor as the Supreme Person-
ality of Godhead standing before us. This is further explained in the
following verse.

TRANSLATION

My dear mother, O daughter of Svayambhuva Manu, the time factor, as
I have explained, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead from whom the
creation begins as a result of the agitation of the neutral, unmanifested
nature.

PURPORT

The unmanifested state of material nature, pradhana, is being explained.
The Lord says that when the unmanifested material nature is agitated by
the glance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, it begins to manifest
itself in different ways. Before this agitation, it remains in the neutral
state, without interaction by the three modes of material nature. In
other words, material nature cannot produce any variety of manifesta-
tions without the contact of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is
very nicely explained in Bhagavad-gitd. The Supreme Personality of God-
head is the cause of the products of material nature. Without His contact,
material nature cannot produce anything.

In the Caitanya-caritimrta also, a very suitable example is given in this
connection. Although the nipples on a goat’s neck appear to be breast
nipples, they do not give milk. Similarly, material nature appears to the
material scientist to act and react in a wonderful manner, but in reality
it cannot act without the agitator, time, who is the representation of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. When time agitates the neutral state of
material nature, then material nature begins to produce varieties of mani-
festations. Ultimately it is said that the Supreme Personality of Godhead
is the cause of creation. As a woman cannot produce children unless
impregnated by a man, similarly material nature cannot produce or
manifest anything unless it is impregnated by the Supreme Personality of
Godhead in the form of the time factor.

TRANSLATION
By exhibiting His potencies, the Supreme Personality of Godhead
adjusts all these different elements, keeping Himself within as the
Supersoul and without as time.

PURPORT
Here it is stated that within the heart the Supreme Personality of
Godhead resides as the Supersoul. This situation is also explained in
Bhagavad-gita: the Supersoul rests beside the individual soul and acts as a
witness. This is also confirmed elsewhere in the Vedic literature: two
birds are sitting on the same tree of the body; one is witnessing, and the
other is eating the fruits of the tree. This purusa or Paramatma
who resides within the body of the individual soul is described in
Bhagavad-gita (13.23) as the upadrasta, witness, and the anumanta,
sanctioning authority. The conditioned soul engages in the happiness and
distress of the particular body given him by the arrangement of the
external energy of the Supreme Lord. But the supreme living being, or
the Paramatma, is different from the conditioned soul. He is described in
Bhagavad-gita as mahesvara, or the Supreme Lord. He is Paramatma, not
jivatmd. Paramatma means the Supersoul who is sitting by the side of the
conditioned soul just to sanction his activities. The conditioned soul comes
to this material world in order to lord it over material nature. Since one
cannot do anything without the sanction of the Supreme Lord, He lives
with the jive soul as witness and sanction-giver. He is also bhokta; He


--- Page 84 ---
1084 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 26
gives maintenance and sustenance (0 the conditioned soul.

Since the living entity is constitutionally part and parcel of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Lord is very affectionate to the
living entities. Unfortunately, when the living entity is bewildered or
illusioned by the external energy, he becomes forgetful of his eternal
relationship with the Lord, but as soon as he becomes aware of his
constitutional position, then he is liberated. The minute independence of
the conditioned soul is exhibited by his marginal position. If he likes, he
can forget the Supreme Personality of Godhead and come into the
material existence with a false ego to lord it over material nature, but if
he likes, he can turn his face to the service of the l.ord. The individual
living entity is given that independence. His conditional life is ended and
his life becomes successful as soon as he turns his face to the Lord, but by
misusing his independence he enters into material existence. Yet the Lord
is so kind that, as Supersoul, He always remains with the conditioned soul.
The concern of the Lord is neither to enjoy nor to suffer from the material
body. He remains with the jiva simply as sanction-giver and witness so
that the living entity can receive the results of his activities, good or bad.

Outside the body of the conditioned soul, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead remains as the time factor. According to the sankhya system of
philosophy, there are twenty-five elements. The twenty-four elements
already described plus the time factor make twenty-five. According to
some learned philosophers, the Supersoul is included to make a total of
twenty-six elements.

Text 19] Fundamental Principles of Material Nature 1085
TRANSLATION

After the Supreme Personality of Godhead impregnates material nature
with His internal potency, material nature delivers the sum total of the
cosmic intelligence, which is known as Hiranmaya. This takes place in
material nature when she is agitated by the destinations of the conditioned
souls.

PURPORT

This impregnation of material nature is described in Bhagavad-gita,
Fourteenth Chapter, third verse. Material nature’s primal factor is the
mahat-tattva, or breeding source of all varieties. This part of material
nature, which is called pradhana as well as Brahman, is impregnated by the
Supreme Personality of Godhead and delivers varieties of living entities.
Material nature in this connection is called Brahman because it is a per-
verted reflection of the spiritual nature.

It is described in the Vispu Purana that the living entities belong to the
spiritual nature. The potency of the Supreme Lord is spiritual, and the
living entities, although they are called marginal potency, are also spiritual.
If the living entities were not spiritual, this description of impregnation by
the Supreme Lord would not be applicable. The Supreme Lord does not
put His semina into that which is not spiritual, but it is stated here that
the Supreme Person puts His semina into material nature. This means that
the living entities are spiritual by nature. After impregnation, material
nature delivers all kinds of living entities, beginning from the greatest
living creature, Lord Brahma, down to the insignificant ant, in all varieties
of form. In Bhagavad-gita (14.4) material nature is clearly mentioned as
sarva-yonigu. This means that of all varieties of species—demigods, human
beings, animals, birds and beasts (whatever is manifested)—material nature
is the mother, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the seed-giving
father. Generally it is experienced that the father gives life to a child but
the mother gives its body; although the seed of life is given by the father,
the body develops within the womb of the mother. Similarly, the spiritual
living entities are impregnated into the womb of material nature, but the
body, being supplied by material nature, takes on many different species
and forms of life. The theory that the symptoms of life are manifest by the
interaction of the twenty-four material elements is not supported here.
The living force comes directly from the Supreme Personality of Godhead
and is completely spiritual. Therefore, no material scientific advancement
can produce life. The living force comes from the spiritual world and has
nothing to do with the interaction of the material elements.

TRANSLATION
Thus, after manifesting variegatedness, the effulgent mahat-tattva, which
contains all the universes within itself, which is the root of all cosmic
manifestations and which is not destroyed at the time of annihilation,
swallows up the darkness which covered the effulgence at the time of
dissolution.
PURPORT
Since the Supreme Personality of Godhead is ever existing, all-blissful
and full of knowledge, His different energies are also ever existing in the
dormant stage. Thus when the mahat-tattva was created, it manifested
the material ego and swallowed up the darkness which covered the cosmic
manifestation at the time of dissolution. This idea can be further explained.
A person at night remains inactive, covered by the darkness of night, but
when he is awakened in the morning, the covering of night, or the forgetful-
ness of the sleeping state, disappears. Similarly, when the mahat-tattva
appears after the night of dissolution, the effulgence is manifested to
exhibit the variegatedness of this material world.

TRANSLATION

The mode of goodness, which is the clear, sober status of understanding
the Personality of Godhead and which is generally called vasudeva, or
consciousness, becomes manifest in the mahat-tattva.

PURPORT

The vasudeva manifestation or the status of understanding the Supreme
Personality of Godhead is called pure goodness or suddha-sattva. In the
Suddha-sattva status there is no infringement of the other qualities, namely
passion and ignorance. In the Vedic literature there is mention of the
Lord’s expansion as the four Personalities of Godhead—Vasudeva,
Sankarsana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha. Here in the reappearance of the
mahat-tattva the four expansions of Godhead occur. He who is seated
within as Supersoul expands first as Vasudeva.

The vdsudeva stage is free from infringement by material desires and is
the status in which one can understand the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, or the objective which is described in the Bhagavad-gita as
adbhuta. This is another feature of the mahat-tattva. The vasudeva
expansion is also called Krsna consciousness, for it is free from all tinges
of material passion and ignorance. This clear state of understanding helps
one to know the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The vasudeva statusis
also explained in Bhagavad-gitd as ksetra-jiia, which means the knower of
the field of activities as well as the Superknower. The living being who has
occupied a particular type of body knows that body, but the Superknower,
Vasudeva, knows not only a particular type of body but also the field of
activities in all the different varieties of bodies. In order to be situated in
clear consciousness or Krsna consciousness, one must worship Vasudeva.


--- Page 88 ---
1088 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 26
Vasudeva is Krsna alone. When Krsna or Vispu is alone, without the
accompaniment of His internal energy, lle is Vasudeva. When He is
accompanied by His internal potency, He is called Dvarakadhisa. To have
clear consciousness or Krsna consciousness, one has to worship Vasudeva.
It is also explained in Bhagavad-gita that after many, many births one
surrenders to Vasudeva. Such a great soul is very rare.

In order to get release from the false ego one has to worship Sankarsana.
Sankarsana is also worshiped through Lord Siva; the snakes which cover
the body of Lord Siva are representations of Sankarsana, and Lord Siva is
always absorbed in meditation upon Saikarsana. One who 15 actually a
worshiper of Lord Siva as a devotee of Sankarsana can be released from
false material ego. If one wants to get free from mental disturbances one
has to worship Aniruddha. For this purpose, worship of the moon planet
is also recommended in the Vedic literature. Similarly, to be fixed in one’s
intelligence one has to worship Pradyumna, who is reached through the
worship of Brahma. These matters are explained in Vedic literature.

After the manifestation of the mahat-tattva, these features appear
simultaneously. As water in its natural state, before coming in contact
with earth, is clear, sweet and unruffled, so the characteristic traits of pure
consciousness are complete serenity, clarity, and freedom from distraction.

PURPORT

The pure status of consciousness, or Krsna consciousness, exists in the

beginning; just after creation, consciousness is not polluted. The more one


--- Page 89 ---
Texts 23-24] Fundamental Principles of Material Nature 1089
becomes materially contaminated, however, the more consciousness be-
comes obscured. In pure consciousness one can perceive a slight reflection
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As in clear, unagitated water, free
from impurities, one can see everything clearly, so in pure consciousness
or Krsna consciousness one can see things as they are. One can see the
reflection of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and one can see his
own existence as well. This state of consciousness is very pleasing, trans-
parent and sober. In the beginning, consciousness is pure.

The material energy springs up from the mahat-tattva which evolved

with active power of three kinds—good, passionate and ignorant. From


--- Page 90 ---
1090 Srimad-Bhagavatam [ Canto 3, Ch. 26
these three types of material ego, the mind, the senses of perception and
the organs of action, and the gross elements evolve.

PURPORT

In the beginning, from clear consciousness or the pure state of Krsna
consciousness, the first contamination sprang up. This is called false ego,
or identification of the body as self. The living entity exists in the
natural state of Krsna consciousness, but he has marginal independence,
and this allows him to forget Krsna. Originally, pure Krsna consciousness
exists, but because of misuse of marginal independence there is a chance
of forgetting Krsna. This is exhibited in actual life; there are many
instances in which someone acting in Krsna consciousness suddenly
changes. In the Upanisads it is stated, therefore, that the path of spiritual
realization is just like the sharp edge of a razor. The example is very
appropriate. One shaves his cheeks with a sharp razor very nicely, but as
soon as his attention is diverted from the activity he immediately cuts his
cheek because he mishandles the razor.

Not only must one come to the stage of pure Krsna consciousness, but
one must also be very careful. Any inattentiveness or carelessness may cause
falldown. This falldown is due to false ego. From the status of pure
consciousness the false ego is born because of misuse of independence. We
cannot argue about why false ego arises from pure consciousness. Fac-
tually, there is always the chance that this will happen, and therefore one
has to be very careful. False ego is the basic principle for all material
activities, which are executed in the modes of material nature. As soon as
one deviates from pure Krsna consciousness, he increases his entanglement
in material reaction. The entanglement of materialism is the material
mind, and from this material mind, the senses and material organs become
manifest.

PURPORT
Ahankara, or false ego, is transformed into the demigods, the con-
trolling directors of material affairs. As an instrument, the false ego is
represented as different senses and sense organs, and as the result of the
combination of the demigods and the senses, material objects are produced.
In the material world we are producing so many things, and this is called


--- Page 92 ---
1092 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 26
advancement of civilization, but factually the advancement of civilization
is a manifestation of the false ego. By false ego all material things are
produced as objects of enjoyment. One has to cease increasing artificial
necessities in the form of material objects. One great dcdrya,
Narottama dasa Théakura, has lamented that when one deviates from pure
consciousness of Vasudeva, or Krsna consciousness, he becomes entangled
in material activities. The exact words he uses are sat-sanga chadi’ kainu
asate vildsa/ te-karane lagila ye karma-bandha-phdnsa: “I have given up
the pure status of consciousness because 1 wanted to enjoy in the tempo-
rary material manifestation;therefore I have been entangled in the network

TRANSLATION

From the false ego of goodness, another transformation takes place.
From this evolves the mind, whose thoughts and reflections give rise to
desire.

PURPORT

The symptoms of the mind are determination and rejection, which are
due to different kinds of desires. We desire that which is favorable to our
sense gratification, and we reject that which is not favorable to sense
gratification. The material mind is not fixed, but the very same mind can
be fixed when engaged in the activities of Krsna consciousness. Otherwise,
as long as the mind is on the material platform, it is hovering, and all this
rejection and acceptanceis asat, temporary. It is stated that he whose mind


--- Page 93 ---
Text 28] Fundamental Principles of Material Nature 1093
is not fixed in Krsna consciousness must hover between acceptance and
rejection. However advanced a man is in academic qualifications, as long
as he is not fixed in Krsna consciousness he will simply accept and reject
and will never be able to fix his mind on a particular subject matter.

TRANSLATION

The mind of the living entity is known by the name of Lord Aniruddha,
the supreme ruler of the senses. He possesses a bluish-black form like a
lotus flower growing in the autumn. He is found solely by the yogis.

PURPORT

The system of yoga entails controlling the mind, and the Lord
of the mind is Aniruddha. It is stated that Aniruddha is four-handed,
with Sudarsana cakra, conchshell, club and lotus flower. There are twenty-
four forms of Vispu, each differently named. Among these twenty-four
forms, Sankarsana, Aniruddha, Pradyumna and Vasudeva are depicted
very nicely in the Caitanya-caritamrta, where it is said that Aniruddha is
worshiped by the yogis. Meditation upon voidness is a modern invention
of the fertile brain of some speculator. Actually the process of yoga
meditation, as prescribed in this verse, should be fixed upon the form of
Aniruddha. By meditating on Aniruddha one can become free from the
agitation of acceptance and rejection. When one’s mind is fixed upon


--- Page 94 ---
1094 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 26
Aniruddha, he gradually becomes God realized; he approaches the pure
status of Krsna consciousness, which is the ultimate goal of yoga.

By transformation of the false ego in passion, intelligence takes birth,

PURPORT
Intelligence is the discriminating power to understand an object, and it
helps the senses to make choices. Therefore intelligence is supposed to be
the master of the senses. The perfection of intelligence is attained when
one becomes fixed in the activities of Krsna consciousness. By the proper
use of intelligence one’s consciousness is expanded, and the ultimate
expansion of consciousness is Krsna consciousness.

TRANSLATION

Doubt, misapprehension, correct apprehension, memory and sleep, as
determined by their different functions, are said to be the distinct
characteristics of intelligence.

PURPORT

Doubt is one of the important functions of intelligence; blind
acceptance of something does not give evidence of intelligence. Therefore
the word samsaya is very important; in order to cultivate intelligence, one
should be doubtful in the beginning. But doubting is not very favorable
when information is received from the proper source. In Bhagavad-gita the
Lord says that doubting the words of the authority is the cause of
destruction.

As described in the Patanjali yoga system, pramdnpa-viparyaya-vikalpa-
nidra-smrtayah. By intelligence one can understand things as they are.
By intelligence only can one understand whether or not he is the body.
The study to determine whether one’s identity is spiritual or material
begins in doubtfulness. When one is able to analyze his actual position,
the false identification with the body is detected. This is viparydsa. When
false identification is detected, then real identification can be understood.
Real understanding is described here as niscayah, or proved experimental
knowledge. This experimental knowledge can be achieved when one has
understood the false knowledge. By experimental or proved knowledge,
one can understand that he is not the body but spirit soul.

Smrti means memory, and svdpa means sleep. Sleep is also necessary to
keep the intelligence in working order. If there is no sleep, the brain cannot
work nicely. In Bhagavad-gita it is especially mentioned that persons who
regulate eating, sleeping and other necessities of the body in the proper
proportion become very successful in the yoga process. These are some of
the aspects of the analytical study of intelligence as described in both the
Pataiijali yoga system and the sarikhya philosophy system of Kapiladeva
in $rimad-Bhagavatam.

TRANSLATION
Egoism in the mode of passion produces two kinds of senses—the
senses for acquiring knowledge and the senses of action. The senses of
action depend on the vital energy, and the senses for acquiring knowledge
depend on intelligence.
PURPORT
It has been explained in the previous verses that mind is the product of
ego in goodness and that the function of the mind is acceptance and
rejection according to desire. But here intelligence is said to be the
product of ego in passion. That is the distinction between mind and
intelligence; mind is a product of egoism in goodness, and intelligence is a
product of egoism in passion. The desire to accept something and reject
something is a very important factor of the mind. Since mind is a product
of the mode of goodness, if it is fixed upon the Lord of mind, Aniruddha,
then the mind can be changed to Krsna consciousness. It is stated by
Narottama dasa Thakura that we always have desires. Desire cannot be
stopped. But if we transfer our desires to please the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, that is the perfection of life. As soon as the desire is trans-
ferred to lording it over material nature, it becomes contaminated by
matter. Desire has to be purified. In the beginning, this purification
process has to be carried out by the order of the spiritual master,
since the spiritual master knows how the disciple’s desires can be trans-
formed into Krsna consciousness. As far as intelligence is concerned, it is


--- Page 97 ---
Text 32] Fundamental Principles of Material Nature 1097
clearly stated here that it is a product of egoism in passion. By practice
one comes to the point of the mode of goodness, and by surrendering
or fixing the mind upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one
becomes a very great personality or mahdatma. In Bhagavad-gita it is
clearly said, sa mahatma sudurlabhah: “Such a great soul is very rare.”

In this verse it is clear that both kinds of senses, the senses for acquiring
knowledge and the senses for action, are products of egoism in the mode
of passion. And because the sense organs for activity and for acquiring
knowledge require energy, therefore vital energy or life energy is also
produced by egoism in the mode of passion. We can actually see, therefore,
that those who are very passionate can improve in material acquisition
very quickly. It is recommended in the Vedic scriptures that if one wants
to encourage a person in acquiring material possessions, one should also
encourage him in sex life. We naturally find that those who are addicted to
sex life are also materially advanced because sex life or passionate life is
the impetus for the material advancement of civilization. For those who
want to make spiritual advancement, there is almost no existence of the
mode of passion. Only the mode of goodness is prominent. We find that
those who engage in Krsna consciousness are materially poor, but one who
has eyes can see who is the greater. Although he appears to be materially
poor, a person in Krsna consciousness is not actually a poor man, but
the person who has no taste for Krsna consciousness and appears to be
very happy with material possessions is actually poor. Persons infatuated
by material consciousness are very intelligent in discovering things for
material comforts, but they have no access to understanding the spirit
soul and spiritual life. If, therefore, anyone wants to advance in spiritual
life, he has to come back to the platform of purified desire, the purified
desire for devotional service. As stated in the Narada-paiicaratra, engage-
ment in the service of the Lord when the senses are purified in Krsna
consciousness is called pure devotion.

TRANSLATION

When egoism in ignorance is agitated by the sex energy of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, the subtle element sound is manifested, and
from sound comes the ethereal sky and the sense of hearing.

PURPORT

It appears from this verse that all the objects of our sense gratification
are the products of egoism in ignorance. It is understood from this verse
that by agitation of the element of egoism in ignorance the first thing
produced was sound, which is the subtle form of ether. It is stated also in
the Vedanta-siitra that sound is the origin of all objects of material
possession and that by sound one can also dissolve this material existence.
Anavrttih sabdat means “liberation by sound.” The entire material manifes-
tation began from sound, and sound can also end material entanglement, if it
has a particular potency. The particular sound capable of doing this is the
transcendental vibration Hare Krsna. Our entanglement in material affairs
has begun from material sound. Now we must purify that sound in
spiritual understanding. There is sound in the spiritual world also. If we
approach that sound, then our spiritual life begins, and the other require-
ments for spiritual advancement can be supplied. We have to understand
very clearly that sound is the beginning of the creation of all material
objects for our sense gratification. Similarly, if sound is purified, our
spiritual necessities also are produced from sound.

Here it is said that from sound the ether became manifested and that
the air became manifested from ether. How the ethereal sky comes from
sound, how the air comes from sky and how fire comes from air will be
explained later on. Sound is the cause of the sky, and sky is the cause of
srotram, the ear. The ear is the first sense for receiving knowledge. One
must give aural reception to any knowledge one wants to receive, either
material or spiritual. Therefore srotram is very important. The Vedic
knowledge is called s$ruti; knowledge has to be received by hearing. By
hearing only can we have access to either material or spiritual enjoyment.

In the material world, we manufacture many things for our material
comfort simply by hearing. They are already there, but just by hearing,


--- Page 99 ---
Text 33] Fundamental Principles of Material Nature 1099
one can transform them. If we want to build a very high skyscraper, this
does not mean that we have to create it. The materials for the skyscraper—
wood, metal, earth, etc.—are already there, but we make our intimate
relationship with those already created material elements by hearing how
to utilize them. Modern economic advancement for creation is also a
product of hearing, and similarly, one can create a favorable field of
spiritual activities by hearing from the right source. Arjuna was a gross
materialist in the bodily conception of life and was suffering from the
bodily concept very acutely. But simply by hearing, Arjuna became a
spiritualized Krsna conscious person. Hearing is very important, and that
hearing is produced from the sky. By hearing only can we make proper
use of that which already exists. The principle of hearing to properly
utilize preconceived materials is applicable to spiritual paraphernalia as
well. We must hear from the proper spiritual source.

TRANSLATION
Persons who are learned and who have true knowledge define sound as
that which conveys the idea of an object, indicates the presence of a
speaker screened from our view and constitutes the subtle form of ether.
PURPORT
It is very clear herein that as soon as we speak of hearing, there must be
a speaker; without a speaker there is no question of hearing. Therefore the
Vedic knowledge, which is known as $ruti, or that which is received by


--- Page 100 ---
1100 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 26
hearing, is also called apaurusa. Apaurusa means “not spoken by any
person materially created.” It is stated in the beginning of Srimad-
Bhagavatam, tene brahma hrda. The sound of Brahman, or Veda, was
first impregnated in the heart of Brahma, the original learned man (adi-
kavaye). How did he become learned? Whenever there is learning, there
must be a speaker and the process of hearing. But Brahma was the first
created being. Who spoke to him? Since no one was there, who was the
spiritual master to give knowledge? He was the only living creature; there-
fore the Vedic knowledge was imparted within his heart by the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, who is seated within everyone as Paramatma.
Vedic knowledge is understood to be spoken by the Supreme Lord, and
therefore it is free from the defects of material understanding. Material
understanding is defective. If we hear something from a conditioned soul,
it is full of defects. All material and mundane information is tainted by
illusion, error, cheating and imperfection of the senses. Because Vedic
knowledge was imparted by the Supreme Lord, who is transcendental to
material creation, it is perfect. If we receive that Vedic knowledge from
Brahma in disciplic succession, then we receive perfect knowledge.

Every word we hear has a meaning behind it. As soon as we hear the
word “water,” there is a substance, water, behind the word. Similarly, as
soon as we hear the word God, there is a meaning to it. If we receive that
meaning and explanation of God from God Himself, then it is perfect.
But if we speculate about the meaning of God, it is imperfect. Bhagavad-
gita, which is the science of God, is spoken by the Personality of Godhead
Himself. This is perfect knowledge. Mental speculators or so-called philoso-
phers who are researching what is actually God will never understand the
nature of God. The science of God has to be understood in disciplic
succession from Brahma, who was first instructed about knowledge of
God by God Himself. We can understand the knowledge of God by
hearing Bhagavad-gita from a person authorized in the disciplic succession.

When we speak of seeing, there must be form. By our sense perception,
the beginning experience is the sky. Sky is the beginning of form. And
from the sky, other forms emanate. The objects of knowledge and sense
perception begin, therefore, from the sky.

vital air; indriya—the senses; atma—and the mind;dhispyatvam—being the

TRANSLATION

The activities and characteristics of the ethereal element can be ob-
served as accommodation for the room for the external and internal
existences of all living entities, namely the field of activities of the vital
air, the senses and the mind.

PURPORT

The mind, the senses and the vital force, or living entity, have forms,
although they are not visible to the naked eye. Form rests in subtle
existence in the sky, and internally it is perceived as the veins within the
body and the circulation of the vital air. Externally there are invisible
forms of sense objects. The production of the invisible sense objects is the
external activity of the ethereal element, and the circulation of vital air
and blood is its internal activity. That subtle forms exist in the ether has
been proven by modern science by transmission of television, by which
forms or photographs of one place are transmitted to another place by the
action of the ethereal element. That is very nicely explained here. This
verse is the potential basis of great scientific research work, for it explains
how subtle forms are generated from the ethereal element, what their
characteristics and actions are, and how the tangible elements, namely air,
fire, water and earth, are manifested from the subtle form. Mental
activities or psychological actions of thinking, feeling and willing are
also activities on the platform of ethereal existence. The statement in
Bhagavad-gita that the mental situation at the time of death is the basis of
the next birth is also corroborated in this verse. Mental existence trans-
forms into tangible form as soon as there is an opportunity due to
contamination or development of the gross elements from subtle form.

TRANSLATION
From ethereal existence, which evolves from sound, the next trans-
formation takes place under the impulse of time, and thus the subtle
element touch and thence the air and sense of touch become prominent.
PURPORT
In the course of time, when the subtle forms are transformed into
gross forms, they become the objects of touch. The objects of touch and
the tactile sense also develop after this evolution in time. Sound is the
first sense object to exhibit material existence, and from the perception of
sound, touch perception evolves and from touch perception the perception
of sight. That is the way of the gradual evolution of our perceptive
objects.

Softness and hardness and cold and heat are the distinguishing attri-
butes of touch, which is characterized as the subtle form of air.
PURPORT
Tangibility is the proof of form. In actuality, objects are perceived in
two different ways. They are either soft or hard, cold or hot, etc. This
tangible action of the tactile sense is the result of the evolution of air,
which is produced from the sky.

The action of the air is exhibited in movements, mixing, allowing
approach to the objects of sound and other sense perceptions, and
providing for the proper functioning of all other senses.
PURPORT
We can perceive the action of the air when the branches of a tree move
or when dry leaves on the ground collect together. Similarly, it is only by


--- Page 104 ---
1104 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 26
the action of the air that a body moves, and when the air circulation is
impeded, many diseases result. Paralysis, nervous breakdowns, madness
and many other diseases are actually due to an insufficient circulation of
air. In the Ayur-vedic system these diseases are treated on the basis of air
circulation. If from the beginning one takes care of the process of air
circulation, such diseases cannot take place. From the Ayur Veda as well
as from the Srimad-Bhagavatam it is clear that so many activities are going
on internally and externally because of air alone, and as soon as there is
some deficiency in the air circulation, these activities cannot take place.
Here it is clearly stated, netrtvarn dravyae-sabdayoh. Our sense of pro-
prietorship over action is also due to the activity of the air. If the air
circulation is stifled, we cannot approach a place after hearing. If someone
calls us, we hear the sound because of the air circulation, and we approach
that sound or the place from which the sound comes. It is clearly said in
this verse that these are all movements of the air. The ability to detect
odors is also due to the action of the air.

TRANSLATION

Due to interactions of the air and the sensations of touch, one receives
different forms according to predestiny. By evolution of such forms, there
is fire, and the eye sees different forms in color.

PURPORT

Due to predestiny, the touch sensation, the interactions of air, and

the situation of the mind, which is produced of the ethereal element, one


--- Page 105 ---
Text 39] Fundamental Principles of Material Nature 1105
receives a body according to his previous activities. Needless to say, a
living entity transmigrates from one form to another. His form changes
according to predestiny and by the arrangement of a superior authority
which controls the interaction of air and the mental situation. Form is the
combination of different types of sense perception. Predestined activities
are the plans of the mental situation and the interaction of air.

TRANSLATION

My dear mother, the characteristics of form are understood by dimen-
sion, quality and individuality. The form of fire is appreciated by its
effulgence.

PURPORT

Every form that we appreciate has its particular dimensions and charac-
teristics. The quality of a particular object is appreciated by its utility. But
the form of sound is independent. Forms which are invisible can be
understood only by touch;that is the independent appreciation of invisible
form. Visible forms are understood by analytical study of their constitu-
tion. The constitution of a certain object is appreciated by its internal
action. For example, the form of salt is appreciated by the interaction of
salty tastes, and the form of sugar is appreciated by the interaction of
sweet tastes. Tastes and qualitative constitution are the basic principles in
understanding the form of an object.

TRANSLATION
Fire is appreciated by its light and by its capacity to cook, to digest, to
destroy cold, to evaporate, and to give rise to hunger, thirst, eating and
drinking.
PURPORT
The first symptoms of fire are distribution of light and heat, and the
existence of fire is also perceived in the stomach. Without fire we cannot
digest what we eat. Without digestion there is no hunger and thirst or
power to eat and drink. When there is insufficient hunger and thirst, it is
understood that there is a shortage of fire within the stomach, and the
Ayurvedic treatment is performed in connection with the fire element,
agni-mandyam. Since fire is increased by the secretion of bile, the treat-
ment is to increase bile secretion. The Ayurvedic treatment thus corrobo-
rates the statements in Srimad-Bhdgavatam. The characteristic of fire in
subduing the influence of cold is known to everyone. Severe cold can
always be counteracted by fire.

of taste. Because taste is a product of water, there is always saliva on the
tongue.

The characteristics of water are exhibited by its moistening other
substances, coagulating various mixtures, causing satisfaction, maintaining
life, softening things, driving away heat, incessantly supplying itself to
reservoirs of water, and refreshing by slaking thirst.
PURPORT
Starvation can be mitigated by drinking water. It is sometimes found
that if a person who has taken a vow to fast takes a little water at intervals,
the exhaustion of fasting is at once mitigated. In the Vedas it is also
stated, apomayah pranah. “Life depends on water.” With water anything
can be moistened or dampened. Flour dough can be prepared with a
mixture of water. Mud is made by mixing earth with water. As stated in
the beginning of Srimad-Bhagavatam, water is the cementing ingredient of
different material elements. If we build a house, water is actually the
constituent in making the bricks. Fire, water and air are the exchanging
elements for the entire material manifestation, but water is most promi-
nent. Also, excessive heat can be reduced simply by pouring water on the
heated field.

ceived from camphor, menthol and similar other products, pungent smells
are perceived from garlic and onions, and acidic smells are perceived from
turmeric and similar sour substances. The original aroma is the odor
emanating from the earth, and when it is mixed with different substances,
this odor appears in different ways.

The characteristics of the functions of earth can be perceived by
modeling forms of the Supreme Brahman, by constructing places of
residence, by preparing pots to contain water, etc. In other words, the
earth is the place of sustenance for all elements.

PURPORT

Different elements, such as sound, sky, air, fire and water, can be
perceived in the earth. Another feature of the earth especially mentioned
here is that earth can manifest different forms of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. By this statement of Kapila it is confirmed that the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Brahman, has innumerable forms, which are
described in the scriptures. By manipulation of earth and its products,
such as stone, wood, jewel, etc., these forms of the Supreme Lord can be
present before our eyes. When a form of Lord Krsna or Lord Visnu is


--- Page 111 ---
Text 47] Fundamental Principles of Material Nature 1111
manifested by presentation of a statue made of earth, it is not imaginary.
The earth gives shape to the Lord’s forms as described in the scriptures.

In the Brahma-sarnhita there is description of Lord Krsna’s lands, the
variegatedness of the spiritual abode and the forms of the Lord playing a
flute with His spiritual body. All these forms are described in the scrip-
tures, and when they are thus presented they become worshipable. They
are not imaginary as the Mayavada philosophy says. Sometimes the word
bhavana is misinterpreted as “imagination.” But bhdvana does not mean
imagination; it means to give actual shape to the description of Vedic
literature. Earth is the ultimate transformation of all living entities and
their respective modes of material nature.

Since the cause exists in its effect as well, the characteristics of the

elements exist in the earth alone.
PURPORT
Sound is the cause of the sky, sky is the cause of the air, air is the cause
of fire, fire is the cause of water, and water is the cause of earth. In the
sky there is only sound; in the air there is sound and touch; in the fire
there is sound, touch and form; in water there is sound, touch, form and
taste; and in the earth there is sound, touch, form, taste and smell. There-
fore earth is the reservoir of all the qualities of the other elements. Earth
is the sum total of all other elements. The earth has all five qualities of the

of the modes of material nature, entered into the universe with the total
material energy in seven divisions.
PURPORT
After stating the generation of the causes, Kapiladeva speaks about the
generation of the effects. At that time when the causes were unmixed, the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, in His feature of Garbhodakasayi Visnu,
entered within each universe. Accompanying Him were all of the seven
primary elements—the five material elements, the total energy (mahat-
tattva) and the false ego. This entrance of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead involves His entering even the atoms of the material world. This
is confirmed in the Brahma-sarhita (Bs. 5.35): andantarastha-paramanu-
cayantarastham. He is not only within the universe, but within the
atoms also. He is within the heart of every living entity. Garbhodakasayi
Visnu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, entered into everything.

received within matter, and the combination of matter gradually develops
into a complete body. The same principle exists in the universal creation:
the ingredients were present, but only when the Lord entered into the
material elements was matter actually agitated. That is the cause of
creation. We can see this in our ordinary experience. Although we may
have clay, water and fire, the elements take the shape of a brick only
when we labor to combine them. Without the living energy, there is no
possibility that matter can take shape. Similarly, this material world does
not develop unless agitated by the Supreme Lord as the virata-purusa.

universal form of the Lord also manifested therein.

This universal egg, or the universe in the shape of an egg, is called the
manifestation of material energy. Its layers of water, air, fire, sky, ego and
mahat-tattva increase in thickness one after another. Each layer is ten times
bigger than the previous one, and the final outside layer is covered by
pradhana. Within this egg is the universal form of Lord Hari, of whose body
the fourteen planetary systems are parts.


--- Page 116 ---
1116 Srimad-Bhagavatam [ Canto 3, Ch. 26
PURPORT

This universe, or the universal sky which we can visualize with its
innumerable planets, is shaped just like an egg. As an egg is covered by a
skin, so the universe is also covered by various layers. The first layer is
water, the next is fire, then air, then sky, and the ultimate holding crust is
pradhana. Within this egglike universe is the universal form of the Lord as
the virdta-purusa. All the different planetary situations are parts of His
body. This is already explained in the beginning of Srimad-Bhagavatam,
Second Canto. The planetary systems are considered to form different
bodily parts of that universal form of the Lord. Persons who cannot
directly engage in the worship of the transcendental form of the Lord are
advised to think of and worship this universal form. The lowest planetary
system, Patala, is considered to be the sole of the Supreme Lord, and the
earth is considered to be the belly of the Lord. Brahmaloka, or the highest
planetary system, where Brahma lives, is considered to be the head of the
Lord.

This virata-puruse is considered an incarnation of the Lord. The origi-
nal form of the Lord is Krsna, as confirmed in Brahma-sarnhita: ‘“‘adi-
purusa.” The virdta-purusa is also purusa, but He is not adi-purusa.
The adi-purusa is Krsna. Isvarah paramah krspah sac-cid-ananda-vigrahah/
anadir adir govindah. In Bhagavad-gtta Krsna is also accepted as the adi-
purusa, the original. Krsna says, “No one is greater than 1.” There are
innumerable expansions of the Lord, and all of them are purusas or en-
joyers, but neither the virdta-purusa nor the purusa-avataras—Karanodaka-
sayl Visnu, Garbhodakasayr Visnu and Ksirodakasayl Visnu—nor any of
the many other expansions, is the original. In each universe there is
GarbhodakasayT Visnu, the virdte-purusa and Ksirodakasayi Visnu. The
active manifestation of the virata-purusa is described here. Persons who
are in the lower grade of understanding regarding the Supreme Personality
of Godhead may think of the universal form of the Lord, for that is
advised in the Bhagavatam.

The dimensions of the universe are estimated here. The outer covering
is made of layers of water, air, fire, sky, ego and mahat-tattva, and each
layer is ten times greater than the one previous. The space within the
hollow of the universe cannot be measured by any human scientist or
anyone else, and beyond the hollow there are seven coverings, each one
ten times greater than the one preceding it. The layer of water is ten times
greater than the length of the universe, and the layer of fire is ten times
greater than that of water. Similarly, the layer of air is ten times greater


--- Page 117 ---
Text 54] Fundamental Principles of Material Nature 1117
than that of fire. These dimensions are all inconceivable to the tiny brain
of a human being.

It is also stated that this description is of only one egglike universe.
There are innumerable universes besides this one, and some of them are
many, many times greater. It is considered, in fact, that this universe is the
smallest; therefore the predominating superintendent, or Brahma, has
only four heads for management. In other universes, which are far greater
than this one, Brahma has more heads. In the Caitanya-caritamrta it is
stated that all these Brahmas were called one day by Lord Krsna on the
inquiry of the small Brahma, who, after seeing all the larger Brahmas, was
thunderstruck. That is the inconceivable potency of the Lord. No one can
measure the length and breadth of God by speculation or by false
identification with God. These attempts are symptoms of lunacy.

With manifestation of speech, fire also became manifested, and with the

of smell also became manifested.

and in them the sense of sight. In the wake of this sense came the sun-god,
who presides over it. Next there appeared in Him a pair of ears, and in
them the auditory sense and in its wake the dig-devatas, or the deities who
preside over the directions.
PURPORT

The appearance of different parts of the body of the universal form of
the Lord and the appearance of the presiding deities of those bodily parts
is being described. As in the womb of a mother a child gradually grows
different bodily parts, so in the universal womb the universal form of the
Lord gives rise to the creation of various paraphernalia. The senses appear,
and over each of them there is a presiding deity. It is corroborated by this
statement of Srimad-Bhagavatam, and also by Brahma-sarnhita, that the
sun appeared after the appearance of the eyes of the universal form of the
Lord. The sun is dependent on the eyes of the universal form. The
Brahma-samhita also says that the sun is the eye of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, Krsna. Yac-caksur esa savita. Savita means the sun. The sun is
the eye of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Actually, everything is
created by the universal body of the Supreme Godhead. Material nature is
simply the supplier of materials. The creation is actually done by the
Supreme Lord, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita. Mayadhyaksena prakrtih
suyate sa-caracaram (Bg.9.10): “Under My direction does material nature
create all moving and nonmoving objects in the cosmic creation.”

After this, semina (the faculty of procreation) and the god who presides

universe.
PURPORT
It is understood herewith that the faculty to discharge semina is the
cause of death. Therefore, yogis and transcendentalists who want to live
for greater spans of life voluntarily restrain themselves from discharging
semina. The more one can restrain the discharge of semina, the more one
can be aloof from the problem of death. There are many yogis living up to
300 or 700 years by this process, and in the Bhagavatam it is clearly


--- Page 121 ---
Text 59] Fundamental Principles of Material Nature 1121
stated that discharging semina is the cause of horrible death. The more one
is addicted to sexual enjoyment the more susceptible he is to a quick death.

Thereafter the two hands of the universal form of the Lord became
manifested, and with them the power of grasping and dropping things, and
after that Lord Indra appeared. Next the legs became manifested, and with
them the process of movement, and after that Lord Visnu appeared.
PURPORT
The deity presiding over the hands is Indra, and the presiding deity of
movement is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu. Vignu appeared
on the appearance of the legs of the virata-purusa.

over the veins), and then appeared an abdomen.

PURPORT

Blood veins are compared to rivers; when the veins were manifested in
the universal form, the rivers in the various planets were also manifested.
The controlling deity of the rivers is also the controlling deity of the
nervous system. In Ayur-vedic treatment, those who are suffering from the
disease of nervous instability are recommended to take a bath by dipping
into a flowing river.

TRANSLATION
After the mind, the moon appeared. Intelligence appeared next, and
after Sai Lord Brahma appeared. Then the false ego appeared and
then Lord Siva, and after the appearance of Lord Siva came consciousness
and the deity presiding over consciousness.
PURPORT
The moon appeared after the appearance of mind, and this indicates
that the moon is the presiding deity of mind. Similarly, Lord Brahma,
appearing after intelligence, is the presiding deity of intelligence, and Lord
Siva, who appears after false ego, is the presiding deity of false ego. In
other words, it is indicated that the moon-god is in the mode of goodness,
whereas Lord Brahma is in the mode of passion, and Lord Siva is in the
mode of ignorance. The appearance of consciousness after the appearance
of false ego indicates that, from the beginning, material consciousness is


--- Page 124 ---
1124 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 26
under the mode of ignorance and that one therefore has to purify himself
by purifying his consciousness. This purificatory process is called Krsna
consciousness. As soon as the consciousness is purified, the false ego
disappears. Identification of the body with the self is called false identifi-
cation or false ego. Lord Caitanya confirms this in His Siksastaka. He
states that the first result of chanting the maha-mantra, Hare Krsna, is that
dirt is cleared from the consciousness, or the mirror of the mind, and then
at once the blazing fire of material existence is over. The blazing fire of
material existence is due to false ego, but as soon as the false ego is
removed, one can understand his real identity. At that point he is actually
liberated from the clutches of maya. As soon as one is freed from the
clutches of false ego, his intelligence also becomes purified, and then his
mind is always engaged upon the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead appeared on the full-moon day as
Gauracandra, or the spotless transcendental moon. The material moon has
spots on it, but on the transcendental moon, Gauracandra, there are no
spots. In order to fix the purified mind in the service of the Supreme Lord,
one has to worship the spotless moon, Gauracandra. Those who are
materially passionate or those who want to exhibit their intelligence for
material advancement in life are generally worshipers of Lord Brahma, and
persons who are in the gross ignorance of identifying with the body
worship Lord Siva. Materialists like Hiranyakasipu and Ravana are wor-
shipers of Lord Brahma or Lord Siva, but Prahlada, or devotees who are in
the service of Krsna consciousness, worship the Supreme Lord, the Per-
sonality of Godhead.

When the demigods and presiding deities of the various senses were thus
manifested, they wanted to wake their origin of appearance. But upon
failing to do so, they reentered the body of the virata-purusa one after
another in order to wake Him.
PURPORT
In order to wake the sleeping Deity-controller within, one has to
rechannel the sense activities from concentration on the outside to
concentration inside. In the following verses, the sense activities which are
required to wake the virata-purusa will be explained very nicely.

When a man is sleeping, all his material assets—namely the vital energy,

Supersoul helps him.
PURPORT
The explanation of sainkhya philosophy is described here in detail in
the sense that the virdte-puruse, or the universal form of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, is the original source of all the various sense
organs and their presiding deities. The relationship between the virata-
puruse and the presiding deities or the living entities is so intricate that
simply by exercising the sense organs, which are related to their presiding
deities, the virdta-purusa cannot be aroused. It is not possible to arouse
the virdta-purusa or link with the Supreme Absolute Personality of God-
head by material activities. Only by devotional service and detachment
can one perform the process of linking with the Absolute.

one should contemplate.

TRANSLATION

Therefore, through devotion, detachment and advancement in spiritual
knowledge acquired through concentrated devotional service, one should
contemplate that Supersoul as present in this very body, although simul-
taneously apart from it.

PURPORT

One can realize the Supersoul within oneself. He is within one’s body
but apart from the body, or transcendental to the body. Although sitting
in the same body as the individual soul, the Supersoul has no affection for
the body, whereas the individual soul does. One has to detach himself,
therefore, from this material body, by discharging devotional service. It is
clearly mentioned here (bhaktya) that one has to execute devotional ser-
vice to the Supreme. As it is stated in the First Canto, Second Chapter, of
Srimad-Bhagavatam (Bhag. 1.2.7), vasudeve bhagavati bhakti-yogah prayo-
jitah. When Vasudeva, the all-pervading Visnu, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, is served in completely pure devotion, then detachment from the
material world immediately begins. The purpose of sarikhya is to detach
oneself from material contamination. This can be achieved simply by
devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

When one is detached from the attraction of material prosperity, one
can actually concentrate his mind upon the Supersoul. As long as the
mind is distracted toward the material, there is no possibility of concentra-
ting one’s mind and intelligence upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead
or His partial representation, Supersoul. In other words, one cannot con-
centrale his mind and energy upon the Supreme unless he is detached from
the material world. Following detachment from the material world, one
can actually attain transcendental knowledge of the Absolute Truth. As
long as one is entangled in sense enjoyment or material enjoyment, it is
not possible to understand the Absolute Truth. This is also confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita (18.54). One who is freed from material contamination is
joyful and can enter into devotional service, and by devotional service he
can be liberated.

In the Srimad-Bhagavatam, First Canto, it is stated that one becomes
joyful by discharging devotional service. In that joyful attitude, one can
understand the science of God, or Krsna consciousness; otherwise it is not


--- Page 132 ---
1132 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 26
possible. The analytical study of the elements of material nature and the
concentration of the mind upon the Supersoul is the sum and substance of
the sarikhya philosophical system. The perfection of this sarkhya-yoga
culminates in devotional service unto the Absolute Truth.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Third Canto, Twenty-sixth
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “Fundamental Principles of
Material Nature.”

na—not; ajyate—is affected; prakrtaih—of material nature; gunaih—by the
modes; avikarat—from being without change; akartrtvat—by freedom from
proprietorship; nirgupatvat—from being unaffected by the qualities of
material nature; jala—on water; arka-vat— like the sun.
TRANSLATION
The Personality of Godhead Kapila continued: When the living entity
is thus unaffected by the modes of material nature, because he is
unchanging and does not claim proprietorship, he remains apart from the
reaction of the modes, although abiding in a material body, just as the sun
remains aloof from its reflection on water.
PURPORT
In the previous chapter Lord Kapiladeva has concluded that simply by
beginning the discharge of devotional service one can attain detachment
1133


--- Page 134 ---
1134 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 27
and transcendental knowledge for understanding the science of God. Here
the same principle is confirmed. A person who is detached from the modes
of material nature remains just like the sun reflected on the water. When
the sun is reflected on the water, the movement of the water or the
coolness or unsteadiness of the water cannot affect the sun. Similarly,
vasudeve bhagavati bhakti-yogah prayojitah: when one engages fully in the
activities of devotional service, bhakti-yoga, he becomes just like the sun
reflected on the water. Although a devotee appears to be in the material
world, actually he is in the transcendental world. As the reflection of the
sun appears to be on the water but is many millions of miles away from
the water, so one engaged in the bhakti-yoga process is nirguna, or
unaffected by the qualities of material nature.

Avikdra means without change. It is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita that
each and every living entity is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, and
thus his eternal position is to cooperate or to dovetail his energy with the
Supreme Lord. That is his unchanging position. As soon as he changes
this position or employs his energy and activities for sense gratification, it
is called vikdra. Similarly, even in this material body, when he practices
devotional service under the direction of the spiritual master, he comes
to the position which is without change because that is his natural duty.
As stated in the Srimad-Bhagavatam, liberation means reinstatement in
one’s original position. The original position is one of rendering service
to the Lord (bhakti-yogena, bhaktya). When one becomes detached from
material attraction and engages fully in devotional service, that is change-
lessness. Akartrtva means not doing anything for sense gratification. When
one does something at his own risk, there is a sense of proprietorship and
therefore a reaction, but when one does everything for Krsna, there is no
proprietorship over the activities. By changelessness and by not claiming
the proprietorship of activities, one can immediately situate himself in
the transcendental position in which one is not touched by the modes of
material nature, just as the reflection of the sun is unaffected by the water.

TRANSLATION

When the soul is under the spell of material nature and false ego,
identifying his body as the self, he becomes absorbed in material activities,
and by the influence of false ego he thinks that he is the proprietor of
everything.

PURPORT

Actually the conditioned soul is forced to act under the pressure of the
modes of material nature. The living entity has no independence. When he
is under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead he is free,
but when, under the impression that he is satisfying his senses, he engages
in sense gratificatory activities, he is actually under the spell of material
nature. In Bhagavad-gita it is said, prakrtef kriyamanani. One acts accord-
ing to the particular modes of nature he has acquired. Guna means the
qualities of nature. He is under the qualities of nature, but he falsely
thinks that he is the proprietor. This false sense of proprietorship can be
avoided simply by engaging oneself in devotional service under the direc-
tion of the Supreme Lord or His bona fide representative. Arjuna, in
Bhagavad-gita, was trying to accept for himself the responsibility for
killing his grandfather and teacher in the fight, but he became freed from
that proprietorship of action when he acted under the direction of Krsna.
He fought, but he was actually freed from the reactions of fighting,
although in the beginning, when he was nonviolent, unwilling to fight,
the entire responsibility was upon him. That is the difference between
liberation and conditioning. A conditioned soul may be very good and act
in the mode of goodness, but still he is conditioned under the spell of
material nature. A devotee, however, acts completely under the direction
of the Supreme Lord. Thus his actions may not appear to be of a very high
quality to the common man, but the devotee has no responsibility.

TRANSLATION
The conditioned soul therefore transmigrates in different species of life,
higher and lower, because of his association with the modes of material
nature. Unless he is relieved of material activities, he has to accept this
position because of his faulty work.
PURPORT
Here the word karma-dosaih means by faulty actions. This refers to any
activity, good or bad, performed in this material world—they are all
contaminated, faulty actions because of material association. The foolish
conditioned soul may think that he is offering charity by opening hospitals
for material benefit or by opening an educational institution for material
education, but he does not know that all such work is also faulty because
it will not give him relief from the process of transmigration from one
body to another. It is clearly stated here, sad-asan-misra-yonisu. This means
that one may take birth in a very high family or he may take his birth in
higher planets, among the demigods, for his so-called pious activities in
the material world. But this work is also faulty because it does not give
liberation. To take birth in a nice place or a high family does not mean
that one avoids undergoing the material tribulations, the pangs of birth,
death, old age and disease. A conditioned soul under the spell of material
nature cannot understand that any action he performs for sense gratifica-
tion is faulty and that only his activities in devotional service to the Lord
can give him release from the reaction of faulty activities. Because he does
not cease such faulty activities, he has to change to different bodies, some
high and some low. That is called sarmsdra-padavim, which means this
material world, from which there is no release. One who desires material
liberation has to turn his activities to devotional service. There is no
other alternative.

TRANSLATION

Actually a living entity is transcendental to material existence, but
because of his mentality to lord it over material nature, his material
existential condition does not cease, and, just as in a dream, he is affected
by all sorts of disadvantages.

PURPORT

The example of a dream is very appropriate. Due to different mental
conditions, in dreams we are put into advantageous and disadvantageous
positions. Similarly, the spirit soul has nothing to do with this material
nature, but because of his mentality to lord it over, he is put into the
position of conditional existence.

Conditional existence is described here as dhyayato visayan asya.
Visaya means an object of enjoyment. As long as one continues to think
that he can enjoy material advantages, then he is in conditioned life, but
as soon as he comes to his senses, he develops the knowledge that he is not
the enjoyer, for the only enjoyer is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (Bg. 5.29), He is the beneficiary for all the
results of sacrifices and penances (bhoktarari yajiia-tapasam), and He is
the proprietor of all the three worlds (sarva-loka-mahe$varam). He is
the actual friend of all living entities. But instead of leaving proprietor-
ship, enjoyment and the actual position as the friend of all living entities
to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we claim that we are the propri-
etors, the enjoyers and the friends. We perform philanthropic work,


--- Page 138 ---
1138 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 27
thinking that we are the friends of human society. Someone may proclaim
himself to be a very good national worker, the best friend of the people
and of the country, but actually he cannot be the greatest friend of
everyone. The only friend is Krsna. One should try to raise the conscious-
ness of the conditioned soul to the platform of understanding that Krsna
is his actual friend. If one makes friendship with Krsna, he will never be
cheated, and he will get all help needed. Arousing this consciousness of the
conditioned soul is the greatest service, not posing oneself as a great friend
of another living entity. The power of friendship is limited. Although one
claims to be a friend, he cannot be a friend unlimitedly. There is an un-
limited number of living entities, and our resources are limited; therefore
we cannot be of any real benefit to the people in general. The best service
to the people in general is to awaken them to Krsna consciousness so that
they may know that the supreme enjoyer, the supreme proprietor and the
supreme friend is Krsna. Then this illusory dream of lording it over material
nature will vanish.

--- Page 139 ---
Text 5] Understanding Material Nature 1139
PURPORT

The process of liberation is very nicely explained in this verse. The
cause of one’s becoming conditioned by material nature is his thinking
himself the enjoyer, the proprietor or the friend of all living entities. This
false thinking is a result of contemplation on sense enjoyment. When one
thinks that he is the best friend to his countrymen, to society or to
humanity and he engages in various nationalistic, philanthropic and
altruistic activities, all that is just so much concentration on sense gratifi-
cation. The so-called national leader or humanist does not serve anyone;
he serves his senses only. That is a fact. But the conditioned soul cannot
understand this because he is bewildered by the spell of material nature.
It is therefore recommended in this verse that one should engage very
seriously in the devotional service of the Lord. This means that he should
not think that he is the proprietor, benefactor, friend or enjoyer. He
should always be cognizant that the real enjoyer is Krsna, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead; that is the basic principle of bhakti-yoga. One
must be firmly convinced of these three principles: one should always
think that Krsna is the proprietor, Krsna is the enjoyer and Krsna is the
friend. Not only should he understand these principles himself, but he
should try to convince others and propagate Krsna consciousness.

As soon as one engages in such serious devotional service of the Lord,
naturally the propensity to falsely claim lordship over material nature
disappears. That detachment is called vairdgya. Instead of being absorbed
in so-called material lordship, one engages in Krsna consciousness; that is
control of consciousness. The yoga process necessitates controlling the
senses. Yoga indriya-samyama. Since the senses are always active, their
activities should be engaged in devotional service—one cannot stop their
activities. If one wants to artificially stop the activities of the senses, it will
be a failure. Even the great yogi Visvamitra, who was trying to control his
senses by the yoga process, fell victim to the beauty of Menaka. There are
many suchinstances. Unless one’s mind and consciousness are fully engaged
in devotional service, there is always the opportunity for the mind to
become occupied with desires for sense gratification. One particular point
mentioned in this verse is very significant. It is said here, prasaktam
asatarn pathi: the mind is always attracted by asat, the temporary
material existence. Because we have been associated with material nature
since time immemorial, we have become accustomed to our attachment
for this temporary material nature. The mind has to be fixed at the
eternal lotus feet of the Supreme Lord. Sa vai manah krsna-padaravindayoh.


--- Page 140 ---
1140 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 27
One has to fix the mind at the lotus feet of Krsna; then everything will be
very nice. Thus the seriousness of bhakti-yoga is stressed in this verse.

TRANSLATION
One has to become faithful by practicing the controlling process of the
yoga system and must elevate himself to the platform of unalloyed
devotional service by chanting and hearing about Me.
PURPORT
Yoga is practiced in eight different stages: yama, niyama, asana, prana-
yama, pratydahara, dhdrapa, dhyana, and samadhi. Yama and niyama mean
practicing the controlling process by following strict regulations, and asana
refers to the sitting postures. These help to raise one to the standard of
faithfulness in devotional service. The practice of yoga by physical exercise
is not the ultimate goal; the real end is to concentrate and to control the
mind and train oneself to be situated in faithful devotional service.
Bhavena, or bhava, is a very important factor in the practice of yoga or
in any spiritual process. Bhava is explained in Bhagavad-gita (10.8). Budha
bhava-samanvitah: one should be absorbed in the thought of love of Krsna.
When one knows that Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the
source of everything and that everything emanates from Him (01077) sarvas-
ya prabhavah), then one understands the Vedanta aphorism janmady asya
yatah (the original source of everything), and then he can become
absorbed in bhava, or the preliminary stage of love of Godhead.


--- Page 141 ---
Text 7] Understanding Material Nature 1141
Rupa Gosvaml explains very nicely in Bhakti-rasamyta-sindhu how this
bhava, or preliminary stage of love of God, is achieved. He states that one
first of all has to become faithful (sraddhayanvitah). Faith is attained by
controlling the senses, either by yoga practice, following the rules and
regulations and practicing the sitting postures, or by engaging directly in
bhakti-yoga as recommended in the previous verse. Of the nine different
items of bhakti-yoga, the first and foremost is to chant and hear about the
Lord. That is also mentioned here. Mat-katha-sravanena ca. One may come
to the standard of faithfulness by following the rules and regulations of
the yoga system, and the same goal can be achieved simply by chanting
and hearing about the transcendental activities of the Lord. The word ca
is significant. Bhakti-yoga is direct, and the other process is indirect. But
even if the indirect process is taken, there is no success unless one comes
fully to the direct process of hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord.
Therefore the word satyena is used here. In this connection Svami
Sridhara comments that satyena means nigkapatena, “without duplicity.”
The impersonalists are full of duplicity. Sometimes they pretend to execute
devotional service, but their ultimate idea is to become one with the
Supreme. This is duplicity, kapata. The Bhagavatam does not allow this
duplicity. In the beginning of Srimad-Bhagavatam it is clearly stated,
paramo nirmatsaranam: “This treatise of Srimad-Bhagavatam is meant for
those who are completely free from envy.” The same point is again
stressed here. Unless one is completely faithful to the Supreme Personality
of Godhead and engages himself in the process of hearing and chanting the
glories of the Lord, there is no possibility for liberation.

TRANSLATION

In executing devotional service, one has to see every living entity
equally, without enmity towards anyone yet without intimate connections
with anyone. One has to observe celibacy, be grave and execute his eternal
activities, offering the results to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

PURPORT

A devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead who seriously
engages in devotional service is equal to all living entities. There are various
species of living entities, but a devotee does not see the outward covering;
he sees the inner soul inhabiting the body. Because each and every soul is
part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he does not see
any difference. That is the vision of a learned devotee. As explained in
Bhagavad-gita, a devotee or a learned sage does not see any difference
between 8 learned brahmana, a dog, an elephant or a cow because he knows
that the body is the outer covering only and that the soul is actually part
and parcel of the Supreme Lord. A devotee has no enmity towards any
living entity, but that does not mean that he mixes with everyone. That is
prohibited. Aprasangatah means ‘not to be in intimate touch with every-
one.” A devotee is concerned with his execution of devotional service,
and he should therefore mix with devotees only, in order to advance his
objective. He has no business mixing with others, for although he does not
see anyone as his enemy, his dealings are only with persons who engage in
devotional service. A devotee should observe the vow of celibacy. Celibacy
does not necessitate that one be absolutely free from sex life; satisfaction
with one’s wife is permitted also under the vow of celibacy. The best
policy is to avoid sex life altogether. That is preferable. Otherwise, a
devotee can get married under religious principles and live peacefully with
a wife. A devotee should not speak needlessly. A serious devotee has no
time to speak of nonsense. He is always busy in Krsna consciousness.
Whenever he speaks, he speaks about Krsna. Mauna means “silence.”
Silence does not mean that one should not speak at all, but that he should
not speak of nonsense. He should be very enthusiastic in speaking about
Krsna. Another important item described here is sva-dharmena, or being
exclusively occupied in one’s eternal occupation, which is to act as the
eternal servitor of the Lord, or to act in Krsna consciousness. The next
word, baliyasa, means *‘offering the result of all activities to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead.” A devotee does not act on his personal account
for sense gratification. Whatever he earns, whatever he eats and whatever


--- Page 143 ---
Text 8] Understanding Material Nature 1143
he does, he offers for the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead.

TRANSLATION

For his income a devotee should be satisfied with what he earns without
great difficulty. He should not eat more than what is necessary. He should
live in a secluded place and always be thoughtful, peaceful, friendly, com-
passionate and self-realized.

PURPORT

Everyone who has accepted a material body must maintain the necessi-
ties of the body by acting or earning some livelihood. A devotee should
only work for such income as is absolutely necessary. He should be
satisfied always with such income and should not endeavor to earn more
and more simply to accumulate the unnecessary. A person in the
conditioned state who has no money is always found to be working very
hard to earn some with the object of lording it over material nature.
Kapiladeva instructs that we should not endeavor hard for things which
may come automatically, without extraneous labor. The exact word used
in this connection, yadrcchayd, means that every living entity has a pre-
destined happiness and distress in his present body ; this is called the law of
karma. 11 is not possible that simply by endeavors to accumulate more
money a person will be able to do so, otherwise almost everyone would be
on the same level of wealth. In reality everyone is earning and acquiring
according to his predestined karma. According to the Bhagavatam con-


--- Page 144 ---
1144 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 27
clusion, we are sometimes faced with dangerous or miserable conditions
without endeavoring for them, and similarly we may have prosperous
conditions without endeavoring for them. We are advised to let these
things come as predestined. We should engage our valuable time in
prosecuting Krsna consciousness. In other words, one should be satisfied
by his natural condition. If by predestination one is put into a certain
condition of life which is not very prosperous in comparison to another’s
position, one should not be disturbed. He should simply try to utilize his
valuable time to advance in Krsna consciousness. Advancement in Krsna
consciousness does not depend on any materially prosperous or distressed
condition; it is free from the conditions imposed by material life. A very
poor man can execute Krsna consciousness as effectively as a very rich
man. One should therefore be very satisfied with his position as offered by
the Lord.

Another word here is mita-bhuk. This means that one should eat only
as much as necessary to maintain the body and soul together. One should
not be gluttonous to satisfy the tongue. Grains, fruits, milk and similar
foods are allotted for human consumption. One should not be excessively
eager to satisfy the tongue and eat that which is not meant for humanity.
Particularly, a devotee should eat only prasada, or food which is offered
to the Personality of Godhead. His position is to accept the remnants of
those foodstuffs. Innocent foods like grains, vegetables, fruits, flowers,
and milk preparations are offered to the Lord, and therefore there is no
scope for offering foods which are in the modes of passion and ignorance.
A devotee should not be greedy. It is also recommended that the devotee
should be muni, or thoughtful; he should always think of Krsna and how
to render better service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That
should be his only anxiety. As a materialist is always thoughtful about
improving his material condition, so a devotee’s thoughts should always be
engaged in improving his condition in Krsna consciousness; therefore he
should be a muni.

The next item recommended is that a devotee should live in a secluded
place. Generally a common man is interested in pounds, shillings and
pence, or materialistic advancement in life, which is unnecessary for a
devotee. A devotee should select a place of residence where everyone is
interested in devotional service. Generally, therefore, a devotee goes to a
sacred place of pilgrimage where devotees live. It is recommended that he
live in a place where there is no large number of ordinary men. It is very
important (vivikta-§arana) to live in a secluded place. The next item is
santa, or peacefulness. The devotee should not be agitated. He should be


--- Page 145 ---
Text 9] Understanding Material Nature 1145
satisfied with his natural income, eat only as much as he needs to keep his
health, live in a secluded place and always remain peaceful. Peace of mind
is necessary for prosecuting Krsna consciousness.

The next item is maitra, friendliness. A devotee should be friendly to
everyone, but his intimate friendship should be with devotees only. With
others he should be official. He may say, “Yes, sir, what you say is all
right,” but he is not intimate with them. A devotee should, however, have
compassion for persons who are innocent, who are neither atheistic nor
very much advanced in spiritual realization. A devotee should be com-
passionate towards them and instruct them as far as possible in making
advancement in Krsna consciousness. A devotee should always remain
atmavan, or situated in his spiritual position. He should not forget that
his main concern is to make advancement in spiritual consciousness, or
Krsna consciousness, and he should not ignorantly identify himself with
the body or the mind. Atma means the body or the mind, but here the
word atmavan especially means that one should be self-possessed. He
should always remain in the pure consciousness that he is spirit soul and
not the material body or the mind. That will make him progress confi-
dently in Krsna consciousness.

1146 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 27
PURPORT
The conditioned souls are eager to identify with the body and consider
that the body is “myself” and that anything in relationship with the body
or possessions of the body is “mine.” In Sanskrit this is called aharh
mamata, and it is the root cause of all conditional life. A person should
see things as the combination of matter and spirit. He should distinguish
between the nature of matter and the nature of spirit, and his real identifi-
cation should be with spirit, not with matter. By this knowledge one
should avoid the false bodily concept of life.

One should be situated in the transcendental position, beyond the
stages of material consciousness, and should be aloof from all other
conceptions of life. Thus realizing freedom from false ego, one should see
his own self just as he sees the sun in the sky.
PURPORT
Consciousness acts in three stages under the material conception of
life. When we are awake, consciousness acts in a particular way, when we
are asleep it acts in a different way, and when we are in deep sleep,
consciousness acts in still another way. To become Krsna conscious, one
has to become transcendental to these three stages of consciousness. Our
present consciousness should be freed from all perceptions of life other


--- Page 147 ---
Text 11] Understanding Material Nature 1147
than consciousness of Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This
is called daribhiatanyae-darsanah, which means that when one attains
perfect Krsna consciousness he does not see anything but Krsna. In the
Caitanya-caritamyrta it is said that the perfect devotee may see many
movable and immovable objects, but in everything he sees that the energy
of Krsna is acting. As soon as he remembers the energy of Krsna, he
immediately remembers Krsna in His personal form. Therefore in all his
observations he sees Krsna only. In the Brahma-sarithita (Bs. 5.38) it is
stated that (premanjana-cchurita) when one’s eyes are smeared with love of
Krsna, he always sees Krsna, outside and inside. This is confirmed here;
one should be freed from all other vision, and in that way he is freed from
the false egoistic identification and sees himself as the eternal servitor of
the Lord. Caksusevarkam: as we can see the sun without a doubt, so one
who is fully developed in Krsna consciousness sees Krsna and His energy.
By this vision one becomes atma-drk, or self-realized. When the false ego
of identifying the body with the self is removed, then actual vision of
life is perceivable. The senses, therefore, also become purified. Real
service of the Lord begins when the senses are purified. One does not
have to stop the activities of the senses, but the false ego of identifying
with the body has to be removed. Then automatically the senses become
purified, and with purified senses one can actually discharge devotional
service.

He is the support of the material cause and He enters into everything. He
is absolute, one without a second, and He is the eyes of the illusory energy.
PURPORT

A pure devotee can see the presence of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead in everything materially manifested. He is present there only as
a reflection, but a pure devotee can realize that in the darkness of material
illusion the only light is the Supreme Lord, who is its support. It is con-
firmed in Bhagavad-gita that the background of the material manifestation
is Lord Krsna. And, as confirmed in the Breahma-sarhhita, Krsna is the
cause of all causes. In the Brahma-sarihita it is stated that the Supreme
Lord, by His partial or plenary expansion, is present not only within this
universe and each and every universe, but in every atom, although He
is one without a second. The word advayam, ‘without a second,” which
is used in this verse, indicates that although the Supreme Personality of
Godhead is represented in everything, including the atoms, He is not
divided. His presence in everything is explained in the next verse.

the wall of a room, although the sun itself is situated in the sky.


--- Page 149 ---
Text 13] Understanding Material Nature 1149
PURPORT
The example given herewith is perfect. The sun is situated in the sky,
far, far away from the surface of the earth, but its reflection can be seen
in a pot of water in the corner of a room. The room is dark, and the sun is
far away in the sky, but the sun’s reflection on the water illuminates the
darkness of the room. A pure devotee can realize the presence of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead in everything by the reflection of His
energy. In the Visnu Purana it is stated that as the presence of fire is
understood by heat and light, so the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
although one without a second, is perceived everywhere by the diffusion
of His different energies. It is confirmed in the Isopanisad that the presence
of the Lord is perceived everywhere by the liberated soul, just as the sun-
shine and the reflection can be perceived everywhere although the sun is
situated far away from the surface of the globe.

TRANSLATION
The self-realized soul is thus reflected first in the threefold ego and then
in the body, senses and mind.
PURPORT
The conditioned soul thinks, “I am this body,” but a liberated soul
thinks, “I am not this body. I am spirit soul.” This “I am” is called ego or
identification of the self. “I am this body” or “Everything in relationship


--- Page 150 ---
1150 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 27
to the body is mine” is called false ego, but when one is self-realized and
thinks that he is an eternal servitor of the Supreme Lord, that identifica-
tion is real ego. One conception is in the darkness of the threefold qualities
of material nature—goodness, passion and ignorance—and the other is in
the pure state of goodness, called §uddha-sattva or vasudeva. When we
say that we give up our ego, this means that we give up our false ego, but
real ego is always present. When one is reflected through the material
contamination of the body and mind in false identification, he is in the
conditional state, but when he is reflected in the pure stage he is called
liberated. The identification of oneself with one’s material possessions in
the conditional stage must be purified, and one must identify himself in
relationship with the Supreme Lord. In the conditioned state one accepts
everything as an object of sense gratification, and in the liberated state one
accepts everything for the service of the Supreme Lord. Krsna conscious-
ness, devotional service, is the actual liberated stage of a living entity.
Otherwise, both accepting and rejecting on the material platform or in
voidness or impersonalism are imperfect conditions for the pure soul.

By the understanding of the pure soul, called satya-drk, one can see
everything as a reflection of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A
concrete example can be given in this connection. A conditioned soul
sees a very beautiful rose, and he thinks that the nice aromatic flower
should be used for his own sense gratification. This is one kind of vision.
A liberated soul, however, sees the same flower as a reflection of the
Supreme Lord. He thinks, “This beautiful flower is made possible by the
superior energy of the Supreme Lord; therefore it belongs to the Supreme
Lord and should be utilized in His service.” These are two kinds of vision.
The conditioned soul sees the flower for his own enjoyment, and the
devotee sees the flower as an object to be used in the service of the Lord.
In the same way, one can see the reflection of the Supreme Lord in his
own senses, mind and body—in everything. With that correct vision, one
can engage everything in the service of the Lord. It is stated in the Bhakti-
rasamrta-sindhu that one who has engaged everything—his vital energy, his
wealth, his intelligence and his words—in the service of the Lord, or who
desires to engage all these in the service of the Lord, no matter how he is
situated, is to be considered a liberated soul, or satya-drk. Such a man has
understood things as they are.

TRANSLATION

Although he appears to be merged in the five material elements, the
objects of material enjoyment, the material senses and material mind and
intelligence, a devotee is understood to be awake and to be freed from the
false ego.

PURPORT

The explanation by Rupa Gosvami in the Bhakti-rasamrta-sindlu of how
a person can be liberated even in this body is more elaborately explained
in this verse. The living entity who has become satya-drk, who realizes
his position in relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
may remain apparently merged in the five elements of matter, the five
material sense objects, the ten senses and the mind and the intelligence,
but still he is considered to be awake and to be freed from the reaction of
false ego. Here the word lina is very significant. The Mayavadi philosophers
recommend merging in the impersonal effulgence of Brahman; that is
their ultimate goal or destination. That merging is also mentioned here.
But in spite of merging, one can keep his individuality. The example given
by Jiva Gosvami is that a green bird who enters a green tree appears to
merge in the color of greenness, but actually the bird does not lose its
individuality. Similarly, a living entity merged either in the material
nature or in the spiritual nature does not give up his individuality. Real
individuality is to understand oneself to be the eternal servitor of the
Supreme Lord. This information is received from the mouth of Lord
Caitanya. He said clearly, upon the inquiry of Sanatana Gosvami, that a
living entity is the servitor of Krsna eternally. Krsna also confirms in
Bhagavad-gita that the living entity is eternally His part and parcel. The
part and parcel is meant to serve the whole. This is individuality. It is so
even in this material existence, when the living entity apparently merges
in matter. His gross body is made up of five elements, his subtle body is
made of mind, intelligence, false ego and contaminated consciousness, and


--- Page 152 ---
1152 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 27
he has five active senses and five knowledge-acquiring senses. In this way
he merges in matter. But even while merged in the twenty-four elements
of matter, he can keep his individuality as the eternal servitor of the Lord.
Either in the spiritual nature or in the material nature, such a servitor is to
be considered a liberated soul. That is the explanation of the authorities,
and it is confirmed in this verse.

TRANSLATION

Although the living entity can vividly feel his existence as the seer,
still, because of the disappearance of the ego during the state of deep
sleep, he falsely takes himself to be lost, like a man who has lost his
fortune and feels distressed, thinking himself to be lost.

PURPORT

Only in ignorance does a living entity think that he is lost. If by
attainment of knowledge he comes to the real position of his eternal
existence, then he knows that he is not lost. An appropriate example is
mentioned herein: nasta-vitta ivaturah. A person who has lost a great sum
of money may think that he is lost, but actually he is not lost—only his
money is lost. But due to his absorption in the money or identification
with the money, he thinks that he is lost. Similarly, when we falsely
identify with matter as our field of activities, then we think that we are
lost, although actually we are not. As soon as a person is awakened to the


--- Page 153 ---
Text 16] Understanding Material Nature 1153
pure knowledge of understanding that he is an eternal servitor of the
Lord, his own real position is revived. A living entity can never be lost.
When one forgets his identity in deep sleep, he becomes absorbed in
dreams, and he may think himself a different person or may think himself
lost. But actually his identity is intact. This concept of being lost is due
to false ego, and it continues as long as one is not awakened to the
sense of his existence as an eternal servitor of the Lord. The Mayavadi
philosophers’ concept of becoming one with the Supreme Lord is another
symptom of being lost in false ego. One may falsely claim that he is the
Supreme Lord, but actually he is not. This is the last snare of maya’s
influence upon the living entity. To think oneself equal with the Supreme
Lord or to think oneself to be the Supreme Lord Himself is also due to
false ego.

TRANSLATION

When, by mature understanding, one can realize his individuality, then

the situation he accepts under false ego becomes manifest to him.
PURPORT

The Mayavadi philosophers’ position is that at the ultimate issue the
individual is lost, everything becomes one, and there is no distinction
between the knower, the knowable and knowledge. But by minute analysis
we can see that this is not correct. Individuality is never lost, even when
one thinks that the three different principles, namely the knower, the


--- Page 154 ---
1154 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 27
knowable and knowledge, are amalgamated or merged into one. The very
concept that the three merge into one is another form of knowledge, and
since the perceiver of the knowledge still exists, how can one say that the
knower, knowledge and knowable have become one? The individual soul
who 15 perceiving this knowledge still remains an individual. Both in
material existence and in spiritual existence the individuality continues;
the only difference is in the quality of the identity. In the material
identity, the false ego acts, and because of false identification, one takes
things to be different from what they actually are. That is the basic
principle of conditional life. Similarly, when the false ego is purified, one
takes everything in the right perspective. That is the state of liberation.

It is stated in the Topanisad that everything belongs to the Lord.
Isavasyam idam sarvam. Everything exists on the energy of the Supreme
Lord. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita. Because everything is
produced of His energy and exists on His energy, the energy is not
different from Him—but still the Lord declares, “I am not there.” When
one clearly understands one’s constitutional position, everything becomes
manifest. False egoistic acceptance of things conditions one, whereas
acceptance of things as they are makes one liberated. The example given
in the previous verse is applicable here: due to absorption of one’s identity
in his money, when the money is lost he thinks that he is also lost. But
actually he is not identical with the money, nor does the money belong to
him. When the actual situation is revealed, we understand that the money
does not belong to any individual person or living entity, nor is it
produced by man. Ultimately the money is the property of the Supreme
Lord, and there is no question of its being lost. But as long as one falsely
thinks, “I am the enjoyer,” or “lI am the Lord,” this concept of life
continues, and one remains conditioned. As soon as this false ego is
eliminated, one is liberated. As confirmed in the Bhagavatam, situation in
one’s real constitutional position is called mukti, or liberation.

TRANSLATION

Sri Devahiiti inquired: My dear brihmana, does material nature ever
give release to the spirit soul? Since one is attracted to the other eternally,
how is their separation possible?

PURPORT

Devahiiti, the mother of Kapiladeva, here makes her first inquiry.
Although one may understand that spirit soul and matter are different,
their actual separation is not possible, either by philosophical speculation
or by proper understanding. The spirit soul is the marginal potency of the
Supreme Lord, and matter is the external potency of the Lord. The two
eternal potencies have somehow or other been combined, and since it is so
difficult to separate one from the other, how is it possible for the
individual soul to become liberated? By practical experience one can see
that when the soul is separated from the body, the body has no real
existence, and when the body is separated from the soul one cannot
perceive the existence of the soul. As long as the soul and the body are
combined, we can understand that there is life. But when they are
separated, there is no manifested existence of the body or the soul. This
question asked by Devahiti of Kapiladeva is more or less impelled by the
philosophy of voidism. The voidists say that consciousness is a product of
a combination of matter and that as soon as the consciousness is gone, the
material combination dissolves, and therefore there is ultimately nothing
but voidness. This absence of consciousness is called nirvana in Mayavada
philosophy.

Hence even though he is the passive performer of all activities, how can
there be freedom for the soul as long as material nature acts on him and
binds him?

PURPORT

Although the living entity desires freedom from the contamination of
matter, he is not given release. Actually, as soon as a living entity puts
himself under the control of the modes of material nature, his acts are
influenced by the qualities of material nature, and he becomes passive. It
is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita, prakrteh kriyamapani gunaih: the
living entity acts according to the qualities or modes of material nature.
He falsely thinks that he is acting, but unfortunately he is passive. In
other words, he has no opportunity to get out of the control of material
nature because it has already conditioned him. In Bhagavad-gita it is also
stated that it is very difficult to get out of the clutches of material
nature. One may try in different ways to think that everything is void in
the ultimate issue, that there is no God, and that even if the background
of everything is spirit, it is impersonal. This speculation may go on, but
actually it is very difficult to get out of the clutches of material nature.
Devahiiti poses the question that although one may speculate in many
ways, where is liberation as long as one is under the spell of material
nature? The answer is also found in Bhagavad-gita (Bg. 7.14): only one
who has surrendered himself unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord
Krsna (mam eva ye prapadyante) can be freed from the clutches of maya.

Since Devahiiti is gradually coming to the point of surrender, her
questions are very intelligent. How can one be liberated? How can one be
in a pure state of spiritual existence as long as he is strongly held by the
modes of material nature? This is also an indication to the false meditator.
There are many so-called meditators who think, “I am the Supreme Spirit
Soul. 1 am conducting the activities of material nature. Under my direction
the sun is meving and the moon is rising.” They think that by such
contemplation or meditation they can become free, but it is seen that just
three minutes after finishing such nonsensical meditation, they are im-
mediately captured by the modes of material nature. Immediately after
his high-sounding meditation, a “11160108001” becomes thirsty and wants
to smoke or drink. He is under the strong grip of material nature, yet he
thinks that he is already free from the clutches of maya. This question of
Devahiiti’s is for such a person who falsely claims that he is everything,


--- Page 158 ---
1158 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 27
that ultimately everything is void, and that there are no sinful or pious
activities. These are all atheistic inventions. Actually, unless a living entity
surrenders unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead as instructed in
Bhagavad-gita, there is no liberation or freedom from the clutches of maya.

TRANSLATION
Even if the great fear of bondage is avoided by mental speculation and
inquiry into the fundamental principles, still it may appear again, since its
cause has not ceased.
PURPORT
Material bondage is caused by putting oneself under the control of
matter because of the false ego of lording it over material nature. Bhagavad-
88৫ states (Bg. 7.27), iccha-dvesa-samutthena. Two kinds of propensities
arise in the living entity. One propensity is icchd, which means desire to
lord it over material nature or to be as great as the Supreme Lord.
Everyone desires to be the greatest personality in this material world.
Dvesa means envy. When one becomes envious of Krsna or the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, he thinks, “Why should Krsna be the all and all?
I'm as good as Krsna.” These two items, desire to be the Lord and envy of
the Lord, are the beginning cause of material bondage. As long as a
philosopher, salvationist or voidist has some desire to be supreme, to be
everything, or to deny the existence of God, then the cause remains, and
there is no question of his liberation.


--- Page 159 ---
Text 21] Understanding Material Nature 1159
Devahuti very intelligently says, “One may theoretically analyze and
say that by knowledge he has become freed, but actually, as long as the
cause exists, he is not free.” Bhagavad-gita confirms that after performing
such speculative activities for many, many births, when one actually
comes to his real consciousness and surrenders unto the Supreme Lord,
Krsna, then the fulfillment of his research in knowledge is actually
achieved. There is a gulf of difference between theoretical freedom and
actual freedom from material bondage. The Bhagavatam says that if one
gives up the auspicious path of devotional service and simply tries to know
things by speculation, one wastes his valuable time (kli§yanti ye kevala-
bodha-labdhaye). The result of such a labor of love is simply labor; there is
no other result. The labor of speculation is ended only by exhaustion. The
example is given that there is no benefit in husking the skin of an empty
paddy; the rice is already gone. Similarly, simply by the speculative
process one cannot be freed from material bondage because the cause
still exists. One has to nullify the cause, and then the effect will be
nullified. This is explained by the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the
following verses.

long time about Me or from Me. By thus executing one’s prescribed duties,
there will be no reaction, and one will be freed from the contamination of
matter.

PURPORT

Sridhara Svami comments in this connection that by association of
material nature alone one does not become conditioned. Conditional life
begins only after one is infected by the modes of material nature. If
someone is in contact with the police department, that does not mean that
he is a criminal. As long as one does not commit criminal acts, even though
there is a police department, he is not punished. Similarly, the liberated
soul is not affected, although he is in the material nature. Even the
Supreme Personality of Godhead is supposed to be in association with
material nature when He descends, but He is not affected. One has to act
in such a way that in spite of being in the material nature he is not
affected by contamination. Although the lotus flower is in association
with water, it does not mix with the water. That is how one has to live, as
described here by the Personality of Godhead Kapiladeva (animitta-
nimittena sva-dharmenamalatmana.

One can be liberated from all adverse circumstances simply by seriously
engaging in devotional service. low this devotional service develops and
becomes mature is explained here. In the beginning one has to perform his
prescribed duties with a clean mind. Clean consciousness means Krsna
consciousness. One has to perform his prescribed duties in Krsna
consciousness. There is no necessity of changing one’s prescribed duties;
one simply has to act in Krsna consciousness. In discharging Krsna
conscious duties, one should determine whether, by his professional
or occupational duties, Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is
satisfied. In another place in the Bhagavatam it is said, svanusthitasya
dharmasya sarnsiddhir hari-tosanam: everyone has some prescribed duties
to perform, but the perfection of such duties will be reached only if the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, is satisfied by such actions. For
example, Arjuna’s prescribed duty was to fight, and the perfection of his
fighting was tested by the satisfaction of Krsna. Krsna wanted him to
fight, and when he fought for the satisfaction of the Lord, that was the
perfection of his professional devotional duty. On the other hand, when,
contrary to the wish of Krsna, he was not willing to fight, that was im-
perfect.

If one wants to perfect his life, then he should discharge his prescribed
duties for the satisfaction of Krsna. One must act in Krsna consciousness,


--- Page 161 ---
Text 22] Understanding Material Nature 1161
for such action will never produce any reaction (animitta-nimittena). This
is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita. Yajiiarthat karmapo ’nyatra: All
activities should be performed simply for Yajiia, or the satisfaction of
Visnu. Anything done otherwise, without the satisfaction of Visnu or
Yajiia, produces bondage, so here it is also prescribed by Kapila Muni
that one can transcend material entanglement by acting in Krsna
consciousness, which means seriously engaging in devotional service. This
serious devotional service can develop by hearing for long periods of time.
Chanting and hearing is the beginning of the process of devotional service.
One should associate with devotees and hear from them about the
transcendental appearance, activities, disappearance, instructions, etc., of
the Lord.

There are two kinds of $ruti, or scripture. One is spoken by the Lord,
and the other is spoken about the Lord and His devotees. Bhagavad-gita
is the former and Srimad-Bhagavatam the latter. One must hear these
scriptures repeatedly from reliable sources in order to become fixed in
serious devotional service. Through engagement in such devotional service
one becomes freed from the contamination of maya. It is stated in the
Srimad-Bhagavatam that hearing about the Supreme Personality of God-
head cleanses the heart of all contamination caused by the influence of the
three modes of material nature. By continuous, regular hearing, the effects
of the contamination of lust and greed to enjoy or lord it over material
nature diminish, and when lust and greed diminish, one then becomes
situated in the mode of goodness. This is the stage of Brahman realization
or spiritual realization. In this way one becomes fixed on the transcen-
dental platform. Remaining fixed on the transcendental platform is
liberation from material entanglement.

TRANSLATION

This devotional service has to be performed strongly in perfect knowl-
edge and with transcendental vision. One must be strongly renounced and
must engage in austerity and perform mystic yoga in order to be firmly
fixed in self-absorption.

PURPORT

Devotional service in Krsna consciousness cannot be performed blindly
due to material emotion or mental concoction. It is specifically mentioned
here that one has to perform devotional service in full knowledge by
visualizing the Absolute Truth. We can understand about the Absolute
Truth by evolving transcendental knowledge, and the result of such
transcendental knowledge will be manifested by renunciation. That
renunciation is not temporary or artificial, but is very strong. It is said that
development of Krsna consciousness is exhibited by proportionate material
detachment, or vairagya. If one does not separate himself from material
enjoyment, it is to be understood that he is not advancing in Krsna
consciousness. Renunciation in Krsna consciousness is so strong that it
cannot be deviated by any attractiveillusion. One has to perform devotional
service in full tapasya, austerity. One should fast on the two Ekadad
days, which fall on the eleventh day of the waxing and waning moon, and
on the birthdays of Lord Krsna, Lord Rama and Caitanya Mahaprabhu.
There are many such fasting days. Yogena means “‘by controlling the senses
and mind.” Yoga indriya-saniyama. Yogena implies that one is seriously
absorbed in the self and is able, by development of knowledge, to under-
stand his constitutional position in relationship with the Supersclf. In this
way he becomes fixed in devotional service, and his faith cannot be shaken
by any material allurement.

TRANSLATION

The influence of material nature has covered the living entity, and thus
it is as if the living entity were always in a blazing fire. But by the process
of seriously discharging devotional service, this influence can be removed,
just as wooden sticks which cause a fire are themselves consumed by it.

PURPORT

Fire is conserved in wooden sticks, and when circumstances are
favorable, the fire is ignited. But the wooden sticks which are the cause of
the fire are also consumed by the fire if it is properly dealt with. Simi-
larly, the living entity’s conditional life of material existence is due to his
desire to lord it over material nature and due to his envy of the Supreme
Lord. Thus his main diseases are that he wants to be one with the Supreme
Lord or he wants to become the lord of material nature. The karmis try to
utilize the resources of material nature and thus become its lord and
enjoy sense gratification, and the jianis, the salvationists, who have
become frustrated in enjoying the material resources, want to become
one with the Supreme Personality of Godhead or to merge into the
impersonal effulgence. These two diseases are due to material contamina-
tion. Material contamination can be consumed by devotional service
because in devotional service these two diseases, namely the desire to lord
it over material nature and the desire to become one with the Supreme
Lord, are absent. Therefore the cause of material existence is at once
consumed by the careful discharge of devotional service in Krsna con-
sciousness.

A devotee in full Krsna consciousness appears superficially to be a great
karmi, always working, but the inner significance of the devotee’s
activities is that they are meant for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord.
This is called bhakti, or devotional service. Arjuna was apparently a
fighter, but when by his fighting he satisfied the senses of Lord Krsna, he
became a devotee. Since a devotee also engages in philosophical research


--- Page 164 ---
1164 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 27
to understand the Supreme Person as He is, his activities may thus appear
to be like those of a mental speculator, but actually he is trying to under-
stand the spiritual nature and transcendental activities. Thus although
the tendency for philosophical speculation exists, the material effects of
fruitive activities and empiric speculation do not, because this activity is
meant for the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION
By discovering the faultiness of his desiring to lord it over material
nature and by therefore giving it up, the living entity becomes independent
and stands in his own glory.
PURPORT
Because the living entity is not actually the enjoyer of the material
resources, his attempt to lord it over material nature is, at the ultimate
issue, frustrated. As a result of frustration he desires more power than the
ordinary living entity and thus wants to merge into the existence of the
supreme enjoyer. In this way he develops a plan for greater enjoyment.
When one is actually situated in devotional service, that is his indepen-
dent position. Less intelligent men cannot understand the position of the
eternal servant of the Lord. Because the word “servant” is used, they
become confused; they cannot understand that this servitude is not the
servitude of this material world. To be the servant of the Lord is the


--- Page 165 ---
Text 25] Understanding Material Nature 1165
greatest position. If one can understand this and can thus revive one’s
original nature of eternal servitorship of the Lord, he stands fully indepen-
dent. A living entity’s independence is lost by material contact. In the
spiritual field he has full independence, and therefore there is no question
of becoming dependent upon the three modes of material nature. This
position is attained by a devotee, and therefore he gives up the tendency
for material enjoyment after seeing its faultiness.

The difference between a devotee and an impersonalist is that an
impersonalist tries to become one with the Supreme so that he can enjoy
without impediment, whereas a devotee gives up the entire mentality of
enjoying and engages in the transcendental loving service of the Lord.
That is his constitutional glorified position. At that time he is vara, fully
independent. The real 8৮07৫ or iSvara-parama, the supreme (8৮৫7৫ or
supreme independent, is Krsna. The living entity is 0070 only when
engaged in the service of the Lord. In other words, transcendental
pleasure derived from loving service to the Lord is actual independence.

TRANSLATION

In the dreaming state one’s consciousness is almost covered, and one
sees many inauspicious things, but when he is awakened and fully
conscious, such inauspicious things cannot bewilder him.

PURPORT

In the condition of dreaming, when one’s consciousness is almost

covered, one may see many unfavorable things which cause disturbance


--- Page 166 ---
1166 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 27
or anxiety, but upon awakening, although he remembers what happened
in the dream, he is not disturbed. Similarly the position of self-realization
or understanding of one’s real relationship with the Supreme Lord makes
one completely satisfied, and the three modes of material nature, which
are the cause of all disturbances, cannot affect him. In contaminated
consciousness one sees everything to be for his own enjoyment, but in
pure consciousness or Krsna consciousness he sees that everything exists
for the enjoyment of the supreme enjoyer. That is the difference between
the dream state and wakefulness. The state of contaminated consciousness
is compared to dream consciousness, and Krsna consciousness is compared
to the awakened stage of life. Actually, as stated in Bhagavad-gita, the
only absolute enjoyer is Krsna. One who can understand that Krsna is the
proprietor of all the three worlds and that He is the friend of everyone is
peaceful and independent. As long as he does not have this knowledge, a
conditioned soul wants to be the enjoyer of everything; he wants to
become a humanitarian or philanthropist and open hospitals and schools
for his fellow human beings. This is all illusion, for one cannot benefit
anyone by such material activities. If one wishes to benefit his fellow
brother, he must awaken his dormant Krsna consciousness. The Krsna
conscious position is that of pratibuddha, which means “pure conscious
ness.”

--- Page 167 ---
Text 27] Understanding Material Nature 1167
PURPORT

Lord Kapila says that mayi manasam, a devotee whose mind is always
fixed upon the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is
called atmarama or vidita-tattva. Atmarame means “one who rejoices
in the self,” or “one who enjoys in the spiritual atmosphere.” Atma, in
the material sense, means the body or the mind, but when referring to
one whose mind is fixed on the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, atmarama
means “one who is fixed in spiritual activities in relationship with the
Supreme Soul.” The Supreme Soul is the Personality of Godhead, and the
individual soul is the living entity. When they engage in reciprocation of
service and benediction, that is called the atmarama position. This atma-
rama position can be attained by one who knows the truth as it is. The
truth is that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the enjoyer and that
the living entities are meant for His service and enjoyment. One who
knows this truth, and who tries to engage all resources in the service of
the Lord, escapes all material reactions and influences of the modes of
material nature.

An example may be cited in this connection. Just as a materialist
engages in constructing a big skyscraper, similarly, a devotee engages in
constructing a big temple to Vigsnu. Superficially the skyscraper constructor
and temple constructor are on the same level, for both are collecting wood,
stone, iron and other building materials. Bul the person who constructs a
skyscraper is a materialist, and the person who constructs a temple of
Visnu is atmarama. The materialist tries to satisfy himself in relation to
his body by constructing a skyscraper, but the devotee tries to satisfy
the Superself, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by constructing the
temple. Although both are engaged in the association of material activities,
the devotee is liberated, and the materialist is conditioned. This is because
the devotee, who is constructing the temple, has fixed his mind upon the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the nondevotee, who is constructing
the skyscraper, has his mind fixed in sense gratification. If, while per-
forming any activity, even in material existence, one’s mind is fixed upon
the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead, he will not be entangled or
conditioned. The worker in devotional service, in full Krsna conscious-
ness, is always independent of the influence of material nature.

TRANSLATION

When a person thus engages in devotional service and self-realization
for many, many years and births, he becomes completely reluctant to
enjoy any one of the material planets, even up to the highest planet,
which is known as Brahmaloka; he becomes fully developed in conscious-
ness.

PURPORT

Anyone engaged in devotional service to the Supreme Personality of
Godhead is known as a devotee, but there is a distinction between pure
devotees and mixed devotees. A mixed devotee engages in devotional
service for the spiritual benefit of being eternally engaged in the transcen-
dental abode of the Lord in full bliss and knowledge.

In material existence, when a devotee is not completely purified, he
expects material benefit from the Lord in the form of relief from material
miseries, or he wants material gain, advancement in knowledge of the
relationship between the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the living
entity, or knowledge as to the real nature of the Supreme Lord. When a
person is transcendental to these conditions, he is called a pure devotee.
He does not engage himself in the service of the Lord for any material
benefit or for understanding of the Supreme Lord. His one interest is that
he loves the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and he spontaneously
engages in satisfying Him.

The highest example of pure devotional service is that of the gopis in
Vrndavana. They are not interested in understanding Krsna, but only in
loving Him. That platform of love is the pure state of devotional service.
Unless one is advanced to this pure state of devotional service, there is a
tendency to desire elevation to a higher material position. A mixed devotee
may desire to enjoy a comfortable life on another planet with a greater


--- Page 169 ---
Texts 28-29] Understanding Material Nature 1169
span of life, such as on Brahmaloka. These are material desires, but
because a mixed devotee engages in the service of the Lord, ultimately,
after many, many lives of material enjoyment, he undoubtedly develops
Krsna consciousness, and the symptom of this Krsna consciousness is that
he is no longer interested in any sort of materially elevated life. He does
not even aspire to become a personality like Lord Brahma.

energy of unadulterated bliss. That is the ultimate perfectional goal of the
living entity. After giving up the present material body, the mystic devotee
goes to that transcendental abode and never comes back.

PURPORT

Actual self-realization means becoming a pure devotee of the Lord. The
existence of a devotee implies the function of devotion and the object of
devotion. Self-realization ultimately means to understand the Personality
of Godhead and the living entities; to know the individual self and the
reciprocal exchanges of loving service between the Supreme Personality of
Godhead and the living entity is real self-realization. This cannot be attained
by the impersonalists or other transcendentalists; they cannot understand
the science of devotional service. Devotional service is revealed to the pure
devotee by the unlimited causeless mercy of the Lord. This is especially
spoken of here by the Lord— “‘mat-prasadena,” ‘by My special grace.” This
is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita. Only those who engage in devotional
service with love and faith receive the necessary intelligence from the
Supreme Personality of Godhead so that gradually and progressively they
can advance to the abode of the Personality of Godhead.

Nihsreyasa means the ultimate destination. Sva-samsthana means
that the impersonalists have no particular place to stay. The impersonalists
sacrifice their individuality so that the living spark can merge into the
impersonal effulgence emanating from the transcendental body of the
Lord, but the devotee has a specificabode. The planetsrest in the sunshine,
but the sunshine itself has no particular resting place. When one reaches
a particular planet, then he has a resting place. The spiritual sky, which is
known as kaivalya, is simply blissful light on all sides, and it is under the
protection of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As stated in Bhagavad-
gitd, brahmano hi pratisthaham: the impersonal Brahman effulgence rests
on the body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In other words, the
bodily effulgence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is kaivalya, or
impersonal Brahman. In that impersonal effulgence there are spiritual
planets, which are known as Vaikunthas, chief of which is Krsnaloka. Some
devotees are elevated to the Vaikuntha planets, and some are elevated to
the planet of Krsnaloka. According to the desire of the particular devotee,
he is offered a particular abode, which is known as sve-samsthdna, his
desired destination. By the grace of the Lord the self-realized devotee
engaged in devotional service understands his destination even while in the
material body. He therefore performs his devotional activities steadily,


--- Page 171 ---
Text 30] Understanding Material Nature 1171
without doubting, and after quitting his material body he at once reaches
the destination for which he has prepared himself. After reaching that
abode, he never comes back to this material world.

The words lirigad vinirgame, which are used here, mean ‘‘after being
freed from the two kinds of material bodies, subtle and gross.” The subtle
body is made of mind, intelligence, false ego and contaminated conscious-
ness,and the gross body is made of five elements—earth, water, fire, air and
ether. When one is transferred to the spiritual world, he gives up both the
subtle and gross bodies of this material world. He enters the spiritual sky in
his pure spiritual body and is stationed in one of the spiritual planets.
Although the impersonalists also reach that spiritual sky after giving up
the subtle and gross material bodies, they are not placed in the spiritual
planets; as they desire, they are allowed to merge in the spiritual effulgence
emanating from the transcendental body of the Lord. The word sva-
sarmsthanam is also very significant. As a living entity prepares himself, so
he attains his abode. The impersonal Brahman effulgence is offered to the
impersonalists, but those who want to associate with the Supreme Person-
ality of Godhead in His transcendental form as Narayana in the Vaikunthas,
or with Krsna in Krsnaloka, go to those abodes, wherefrom they never
return.

TRANSLATION

When a perfect yogi’s attention is no longer attracted to the by-products
of mystic powers, which are manifestations of the external energy, his
progress towards Me becomes unlimited, and thus the power of death
cannot overcome him.

PURPORT

Yogis are generally attracted to the by-products of mystic yogic power,
for they can become smaller than the smallest or greater than the greatest,
achieve anything they desire, have power even to create a planet or bring
anyone they like under their subjection. Yogis who have incomplete infor-
mation of the result of devotional service are attracted by these powers,
but these powers are material; they have nothing to do with spiritual
progress. As other material powers are created by the material energy, so
mystic yogic powers are also material. A perfect yogi’s mind is not attracted
by any material power, but is simply attracted by unalloyed service to the
Supreme Lord. For a devotee, the process of merging into the Brahman
effulgence is considered to be hellish, and yogic power or the preliminary
perfection of yogic power, to be able to control the senses, is automatically
achieved. As for elevation to higher planets, a devotee considers this to be
simply hallucinatory. A devotee’s attention is concentrated only upon
the eternal loving service of the Lord, and therefore the power of death
has no influence over him. In such a devotional state, a perfect yogi can
attain the status of immortal knowledge and bliss.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Third Canto, Twenty-
seventh Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “Understanding
Material Nature.”

The Personality of Godhead said: My dear mother, O daughter of the
King, now I shall explain to you the system of yoga, the object of which
is to concentrate the mind. By practicing this system one can become
joyful and progressively advance towards the path of the Absolute Truth.
PURPORT
The yoga process explained by Lord Kapiladeva in this chapter is autho-
rized and standard, and therefore these instructions should be followed
very carefully. To begin, the Lord says that by yoga practice one can make
1173


--- Page 174 ---
1174 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 28
progress towards understanding the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Person-
ality of Godhead. In the previous chapter it has been clearly stated that the
desired result of yoga is not to achieve some wonderful mystic power.
One should not be at all attracted by such mystic power, but should attain
progressive realization on the path of understanding the Supreme Person-
ality of Godhead. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gitd, which states in
the last verse of the Sixth Chapter that the greatest yogi is he who
constantly thinks of Krsna within himself, or he who is Krsna conscious.

It is stated here that by following the system of yoga one can become
joyful. Lord Kapila, the Personality of Godhead, who is the highest author-
ity on yoga, here explains the yoga system known as astanga-yoga, which
comprises eight different practices, namely yama, niyama, ৫5৫10,
pranayama, pratydhdra, dharand, dhydna and samadhi. By all these stages of
practice one must realize Lord Visnu, who is the target of all yoga. There
are so-called yoga practices in which one concentrates the mind on voidness
or on the impersonal, but this is not approved by the authorized yoga
system as explained by Kapiladeva. Even Pataiijali explains that the target
of all yoga is Visnu. Astanga-yoga is therefore part of Vaignava practice
because its ultimate goal is realization of Visnu. The achievement of success
in yoga is not aceuisition of mystic power, which is condemned in the
previous chapter, but, rather, freedom from all material designations and
situation in one’s constitutional position. That is the ultimate achievement
in yoga practice.

TRANSLATION

One should execute his prescribed duties to the best of his ability and
avoid performing duties which are not allotted to him. One should be
satisfied with as much gain as he achieves by the grace of the Lord, and one
should worship the lotus feet of a spiritual master.

PURPORT

In this verse there are many important words which could be very
elaborately explained, but we shall briefly discuss the important aspects of
each. The final statement is dtmavic-carapdrcanam. Atma-vit means 8 self-
realized soul or bona fide spiritual master. Unless one is self-realized and
knows what his relationship with the Supersoul is, he cannot be a bona
fide spiritual master. Here it is recommended that one should seek out a
bona fide spiritual master and (arcanam) surrender unto him, for by inquir-
ing from and worshiping him one can learn spiritual activities.

The first recommendation is sva-dharmacarapam. As long as we have this
material body there are various duties prescribed for us. Such duties are
divided by a system of four social orders: brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya and
$80170. These particular duties are mentioned in the ৪৫57৫, and particularly
in Bhagavad-gita. Sva-dharmdcarapjam means that one must discharge the
prescribed duties of his particular division of society faithfully and to the
best of one’s ability. One should not accept another’s duty. If one is born
in a particular society or community, he should perform the prescribed
duties for that particular division. If, however, one is fortunate enough to
transcend the designation of birth in a particular society or community by
being elevated to the standard of spiritual identity, then his sva-dharma, or
duty, is solely that of serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The
actual duty of one who is advanced in Krsna consciousness is to serve the
Lord. As long as one remains in the bodily concept of life, he may act
according to the duties of social convention, but if one is elevated to the
spiritual platform, he must simply serve the Supreme Lord; that is the real
execution of sva-dharma.

TRANSLATION

One should cease performing conventional religious practices and should
be attracted to those which lead to salvation. One should eat very frugally
and should always remain secluded so that he can achieve the highest
perfection of life.

PURPORT

It is recommended herein that religious practice for economic develop-
ment or the satisfaction of sense desires should be avoided. Religious
practices should be executed only to gain freedom from the clutches
of material nature. lt is stated in the beginning of Srimad-Bhdgavatam that
the topmost religious practice is that by which one can attain to the tran-
scendental devotional service of the Lord, without reason or cause. Such
religious practice is never hampered by any impediments, and by its per-
formance one actually becomes satisfied. Here this is recommended as
moksa-dharma, religious practice for salvation or transcendence of the
clutches of material contamination. Generally people execute religious
practices for economic development or for sense gratification, but that is
not recommended for one who wants to advance in yoga.

The next important phrase is mita-medhyadanam, which means that
one should eat very frugally. It is recommended in the Vedic literatures
that a yogi eat only half what he desires according to his hunger. If one
is so hungry that he could devour one pound of foodstuffs, then instead
of eating one pound, he should consume only half a pound and supple-
ment this with four ounces of water; one fourth of the stomach should be
left empty for passage of air in the stomach. If one eats in this manner he
will avoid indigestion and disease. The yogi should eat in this way, as
recommended in the Srimad-Bhdgavatam and all other standard scriptures.
The yogi should live in a secluded place where his yoga practice will not be
disturbed.

brahmacaryam— celibacy; tapah—austerity; Saucam— cleanliness; svadh yayah
—study of the Vedas; purusa-arcanam—worship of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead.
TRANSLATION

One should practice nonviolence and truthfulness, should avoid thieving
and be satisfied with possessing as much as he needs for his maintenance.
He should abstain from sex life, perform austerity, be clean, study the
Vedas and worship the supreme form of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead.

PURPORT

The word purusarcanam in this verse means worshiping the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, especially the form of Lord Krsna. In Bhagavad-
gita it is confirmed by Arjuna that Krsna is the original purusa, or Person-
ality of Godhead, purusam sasvatam. Therefore in yoga practice one must
not only concentrate his mind on the person of Krsna, but must also
worship the form or Deity of Krsna daily.

A brahmacari practices celibacy, controlling his sex life. One cannot
enjoy unrestricted sex life and practice yoga; this is rascaldom. So-called
yogis advertise that one can go on enjoying as one likes and simultaneously
become a yogi, but this is totally unauthorized. It is very clearly explained
here that one must observe celibacy. Brahmacaryam means that one leads
his life simply in relationship with Brahman, or in full Krsna consciousness.
Those who are too addicted to sex life cannot observe the regulations
which will lead them to Krsna consciousness. Sex life should be restricted
to persons who are married. A person whose sex life is restricted in marriage
is also called a brahmacari.


--- Page 178 ---
1178 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 28

The word asteyam is also very important for a yogi. Asteyam means to
refrain from theft. In the broader sense, everyone who accumulates more
than he needs is a thief. According to spiritual communism, one cannot
possess more than he needs for his personal maintenance. That is the law of
nature. Anyone who accumulates more money or more possessions than
he needs is called a thief, and one who simply accumulates wealth without
spending for sacrifice or for worship of the Personality of Godhead is a
great thief.

Svadhyayah means reading the authorized Vedic scriptures. Even if one
is not Krsna conscious and is practicing the yoga system, he must read
standard Vedic literatures in order to understand. Performance of yoga
alone is not sufficient. Narottama dasa Thakura, a great devotee and acarya
in the Gaudiya Vaisnava-sampradaya, says that all spiritual activities should
be understood from three sources, namely saintly persons, standard scrip-
tures and the spiritual master. These three guides are very important for
progress in spiritual life. The spiritual master prescribes standard literature
for the prosecution of the yoga of devotional service, and he himself speaks
only from scriptural reference. Therefore reading standard scriptures is
necessary for executing yoga. Practicing yoga without reading the standard
literatures is simply a waste of time.

Text 6] Kapila’s Instructions on Devotional Service 1179
PURPORT
The yogic practices in general and hatha-yoga in particular are not ends
in themselves; they are means to the end of attaining steadiness. First one
must be able to sit properly, and then the mind and attention will become
steady enough for practicing yoga. Gradually, one must control the circu-
lation of vital air, and with such control he will be able to withdraw the
senses from sense objects. In the previous verse it is stated that one must
observe celibacy. The most important aspect of sense control is controlling
sex life. That is called brahmacarya. By practicing the different sitting
postures and controlling the vital air, one can control and restrain the
senses from unrestricted sense enjoyment.

TRANSLATION
Fixing the vital air and the mind in one of the six circles of vital air
circulation within the body, thus concentrating one’s mind on the
transcendental pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is called
samadhi or samadhana of the mind.
PURPORT
There are six circles of vital air circulation within the body. The first
circle is within the belly, the second circle is in the area of the heart, the
third is in the area of the lungs, the fourth is on the palate, the fifth is
between the eyebrows, and the highest, the sixth circle, is above the brain.
One has to fix his mind and the circulation of the vital air and thus think


--- Page 180 ---
1180 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 28
of the transcendental pastimes of the Supreme Lord. It is never mentioned
that one should concentrate on the impersonal or void. It is clearly stated,
vaikupgha-lila. Lila means pastimes. Unless the Absolute Truth, the Per-
sonality of Godhead, has transcendental activities, where is the scope for
thinking of these pastimes? It is through the processes of devotional service,
chanting and hearing of the pastimes of the Supreme Personality of God-
head, that one can achieve this concentration. As described in the Srimad-
Bhagavatam, the Lord appears and disappears according to His relation-
ships with different devotees. The Vedic literatures contain many narrations
of the Lord’s pastimes, including the Battle of Kuruksetra and historical
facts relating to the life and precepts of devotees like Prahlada Maharaja,
Dhruva Maharaja and Ambarisa Maharaja. One need only concentrate his
mind on one such narration and become always absorbed in its thought.
Then he will be in samadhi. Samadhi is not an artificial bodily state; it is
the state achieved when the mind is virtually absorbed in thoughts of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Text 8] Kapila’s Instructions on Devotional Service 1181
PURPORT
Etair anyais ca. The general yoga process entails observing the rules and
regulations, practicing the different sitting postures, concentrating the mind
on the vital circulation of the air and then thinking of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead in His Vaikuntha pastimes. This is the general
process of yoga. This same concentration can be achieved by other recom-
mended processes, and therefore anyais ca, other methods, also can be
applied. The essential point is that the mind, which is contaminated by
material attraction, has to be bridled and concentrated on the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. It cannot be fixed on something void or
impersonal. For this reason, so-called yoga practices of voidism and
impersonalism are not recommended in any standard yoga-sdstra. The
real yogi is the devotee because his mind is always concentrated on the
pastimes of Lord Krsna. Therefore Krsna consciousness is the topmost
yoga system.

in the yoga scripture that one should put the soles of the feet between the

two thighs and ankles and sit straight; that posture will help one to con-
centrate his mind on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This very
process is also recommended in Bhagavad-gita, Sixth Chapter. 11 is further
suggested that one sit in a secluded, sanctified spot. The seat should
consist of deerskin and kusa grass, topped with cotton.

TRANSLATION
The yogi should clear the passage of vital air by breathing in the
following manner: first he should inhale very deeply, then hold the breath
in, and finally exhale. Or, reversing the process, the yogi can first exhale,
then hold the breath outside, and finally inhale. This is done so that the
mind may become steady and free from external disturbances.
PURPORT
These breathing exercises are performed to control the mind and
fix it on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Sa vai manah krspa-
padaravindayoh: the devotee Ambarisa Maharaja fixed his mind on the
lotus feet of Krsna twenty-four hours a day. The process of Krsna con-
sciousness is to chant Hare Krsna and to hear the sound attentively so that
the mind is fixed upon the transcendental vibration of Krsna’s name, which
is nondifferent from Krsna the personality. The real purpose of controlling
the mind by the prescribed method of clearing the passage of the life air is
achieved immediately if one fixes his mind directly on the lotus feet of


--- Page 183 ---
Text 10] Kapila’s Instructions on Devotional Service 1183
Krsna. The hatha-yoga system, or breathing system, is especially recom-
mended for those who are very absorbed in the concept of bodily
existence, but one who can perform the simple process of chanting Hare
Krsna can fix the mind more easily.

Three different activities are recommended for clearing the passage of
breath: piraka, kumbhaka and recaka. Inhaling the breath is called piraka,
sustaining it within is called kumbhaka, and finally exhaling it is called
recaka. These recommended processes can also be performed in the reverse
order. After exhaling, one can keep the air outside for some time and then
inhale. The nerves through which inhalation and exhalation are conducted
are technically called ida and pingala. The ultimate purpose of clearing the
ida and pingala passages is to divert the mind from material enjoyment. As
stated in Bhagavad-gitd, one’s mind is his enemy, and one’s mind is also his
friend; its position varies according to the different dealings of the living
entity. If we divert our mind to thoughts of material enjoyment, then our
mind becomes an enemy, and if we concentrate our mind on the lotus feet
of Krsna, then our mind is a friend. By the yoga system of piraka,
kumbhaka and recaka or by directly fixing the mind on the sound
vibration of Krsna or on the form of Krsna, the same purpose is achieved.
In Bhagavad-gita (8.8) it is said that one must practice the breathing
exercise (abhydsa-yoga-yuktena). By virtue of these processes of control,
the mind cannot wander to external thoughts (cetasa nanya-gamind). Thus
one can fix his mind constantly on the Supreme Personality of Godhead
and can attain (yati) Him.

Practicing the yoga system of exercise and breath control is very difficult
for a person of this age, and therefore Lord Caitanya recommended,
kirtaniyah sada harih: one should always chant the holy name of the
Supreme Lord, Krsna, because Krsna is the most suitable name of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. The name Krsna and the Supreme Person
Krsna are nondifferent. Therefore, if one concentrates his mind on hearing
and chanting Hare Krsna, the same result is achieved.

The yogis who practice such breathing exercises are very soon freed

This process of purifying the mind is also recommended by Lord
Caitanya; He says that one should chant Hare Krsna. He says further,
param vijayate: “All glories to Sri Krsna sankirtana!™ All glories are given
to the chanting of the holy names of Krsna because as soon as one begins
this process of chanting, the mind becomes purified. Ceto-darpana-
marjanam: by chanting the holy name of Krsna one is cleansed of the dirt
that accumulates in the mind. One can purify the mind either by the
breathing process or by the chanting process, just as one can purify gold
by putting it in a fire and fanning it with a bellows.

TRANSLATION

By practicing the process of pranayama one can eradicate the
contamination of his physiological condition, and by concentrating the
mind one can become free from all sinful activities. By restraining the
senses one can free himself from material association, and by meditating
on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one can become free from the
three modes of material attachment.

PURPORT

According to Ayur-vedic medical science the three items kapha, pitta
and vayu (phlegm, bile and air) maintain the physiological condition of the
body. Modern medical science does not accept this physiological analysis
as valid, but the ancient Ayur-vedic process of treatment is based upon
these items. Ayur-vedic treatment concerns itself with the cause of these
three elements, which are mentioned in many places in the Bhagavatam
as the basic conditions of the body. Here it is recommended that by
praclicing the breathing process of pranayama one can be released from
contamination created by the principal physiological elements, by concen-
trating the mind one can become free from sinful activities, and by
withdrawing the senses one can free himself from material association.

Ultimately, one has to meditate on the Supreme Personality of Godhead
in order to be elevated to the transcendental position where he is no longer
affected by the three modes of material nature. It is also confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita that one who engages himself in unalloyed devotional
service at once becomes transcendental to the three modes of material
nature and immediately realizes his identification with Brahman. Sa gunan
samatityaitan brahma-bhitydya kalpate. For every item in the yoga system
there is a parallel activity in bhakti-yoga, but the practice of bhakti-yoga
is easier for this age. Whal was introduced by Lord Caitanya is not a new
interpretation. Bhakti-yoga is a feasible process that begins with chanting
and hearing. Bhakti-yoga and other yogas have as their ultimate goal the
same Personality of Godhead, but one is practical, and the other is
difficult. One has to purify his physiological condition by concentration
and by restraint of the senses; then he can fix his mind upon the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. That is called samadhi.

yadd manah svam virajam

yada—when; manah—the mind; svam—own; viragjam—purified; yogena—
by yoga practice; su-samé@hitam—controlled; kastham—the plenary expan-
sion; bhagavatah—of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; dhyayet—one
should meditate upon; sva-nasa-agra—the tip of one’s nose; avalokanah—
looking at.
TRANSLATION
When the mind is perfectly purified by this practice of yoga, then one
should concentrate on the tip of the nose with half-closed eyes and see the
form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
PURPORT
It is clearly mentioned here that one has to meditate upon the expansion
of Visnu. The word kastham refers to Paramatma, the expansion of the
expansion of Visnu. Bhagavatah refers to Lord Visnu, the Supreme Person-
ality of Godhead. The Supreme Godhead is Krsna; from Him comes the
first expansion, Baladeva, and from Baladeva come Sarikargana, Aniruddha
and many other forms, followed by the purusa-avataras. As mentioned in
the previous verses (purusarcanam), this purusa is represented as the
Paramatma, or Supersoul. A description of the Supersoul, upon whom one
must meditate, will be given in the following verses. In this verse it is
clearly stated that one must meditate by fixing the vision on the tip of the
nose and concentrating one’s mind on the kala, or the plenary expansion
of Visnu.

prasanna—cheerful; vadana— countenance; ambhojam—lotuslike; padma-

TRANSLATION

The Supreme Personality of Godhead has a cheerful, lotuslike
countenance with ruddy eyes like the interior of a lotus and a swarthy
body like the petals of a blue lotus. He bears a conch, discus and a mace in
three of His hands.

PURPORT

It is definitely recommended herein that one concentrate his mind upon
the form of Visnu. There are twelve different forms of Visnu which are
described in Teachings of Lord Caitanya. One cannot concentrate his mind
on anything void or impersonal; the mind should be fixed on the personal
form of the Lord, whose attitude is cheerful, as described in this verse.
Bhagavad-gita states that meditation on the impersonal or void features is
very troublesome to the meditator. Those who are attached to the imper-
sonal or void features of meditation have to undergo a difficult process
because we are not accustomed to concentrating our minds on anything
impersonal. Actually such concentration is not even possible. Bhagavad-gita
also confirms that one should concentrate his mind on the Personality of
Godhead.

The color of the Personality of Godhead, Krsna, is described here as
nilotpala-dala, meaning that it is like that of a lotus flower with petals
tinted blue and white. People always ask why Krsna is blue. The color of
the Lord has not been imagined by an artist. It is described in authoritative
scripture. In the Brahma-sarhita also, the color of Krsna’s body is
compared to that of a bluish cloud. The color of the Lord is not poetical
imagination. There are authoritative descriptions in the Brahma-sarhhita,
Srimad-Bhagavatam, Bhagavad-gita and many of the Puranas of the Lord’s
body, His weapons and all other paraphernalia. The Lord’s appearance is
described here as padma-garbharuneksanam. His eyes resemble the inside

of a lotus flower, and in His four hands He holds the four symbols:
conchshell, discus, mace and lotus.

His loins are covered by a shining cloth, yellowish like the filaments of
a lotus. On His breast He bears the mark of Srivatsa, a curl of white hair.
The brilliant Kaustubha gem is suspended from His neck.
PURPORT
The exact color of the garment of the Supreme Lord is described as
saffron-yellow, just like the pollen of a lotus flower. The Kaustubha gem
hanging on His chest is also described. His neck is beautifully decorated
with jewels and pearls. The Lord is full in six opulences, one of which is
wealth. He is very richly dressed with valuable jewels which are not visible
within this material world.

TRANSLATION
He also wears around His neck a garland of attractive sylvan flowers,
and a swarm of bees, intoxicated by its delicious fragrance, hums about
the garland. He is further superbly adorned with a pearl necklace, a crown,
and pairs of armlets, bracelets and anklets.
PURPORT
From this description it appears that the flower garland of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead is fresh. Actually, in Vaikuntha or the spiritual
sky there is nothing but freshness. Even the flowers picked from the trees
and plants remain fresh, for everything in the spiritual sky retains its
originality and does not fade. The fragrance of the flowers picked from
the trees and made into garlands does not fade because both the trees and
the flowers are spiritual. When the flower is taken from the tree, it
remains the same; it does not lose its aroma. The bees are equally attracted
to the flowers whether they are on the garland or on the trees. The
significance of spirituality is that everything is eternal and inexhaustible.
Everything taken from everything remains everything, or, as has been
stated, in the spiritual world one minus one equals one, and one plus one
equals one. The bees hum around the fresh flowers, and their sweet sound
is enjoyed by the Lord. The Lord’s bangles, necklace, crown and anklets
are all bedecked with invaluable jewels. Since the jewels and pearls are
spiritual, there is no material calculation of their value.

TRANSLATION
His loins and hips encircled by a girdle, He stands on the lotus of His
devotee’s heart. He is most charming to look at, and His serene aspect
gladdens the eyes and souls of the devotees who behold Him.
PURPORT
The word darsaniyatamam, which is used in this verse, means that the
Lord is so beautiful that the devolee-yogi does not wish to see anything
else. His desire to see beautiful objects is completely satisfied by the sight
of the Lord. In the material world we want to see beauty, but the desire
is never satisfied. All the propensities that we feel in the material world are
never satisfied. Because of material contamination, not all of the propen-
sities we feel in the material world are satisfied. But when our desires to see,
hear, touch, etc., are dovetailed for the satisfaction of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, they are on the level of the topmost perfection.
Although the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His eternal form is so
beautiful and pleasing to the heart of the devotee, He does not attract the
impersonalists who want to meditate on His impersonal aspect. This is
simply fruitless labor. The actual yogis, with half-closed eyes, fix on the
form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, not upon anything void or
impersonal.

situated; vayasi—in youth; kaisore—in boyhood; bhrtya—upon His devotees;
anugraha—to bestow blessings; kataram—eager.
TRANSLATION

The Lord is eternally very beautiful, and He is worshipable by all the
inhabitants of every planet. He is ever youthful and always eager to
bestow His blessing upon His devotees.

PURPORT

The word sarva-loka-namaskrtam means that He is worshipable by
everyone on every planet. There are innumerable planets in the material
world and innumerable planets in the spiritual world as well. On each
planet there are innumerable inhabitants who worship the Lord, for the
Lord is worshipable by all but the impersonalists. The Supreme Lord is
very beautiful. The word $asvat is significant. It is not that He appears
beautiful to the devotees but is ultimately impersonal. Sasvat means ever-
existing. That beauty is not temporary. It is ever-existing—He is always
youthful. In the Brahma-samhita (Bs. 5.33) it is also stated: advaitam
acyutam anddim anante-ripam adyarh purapa-purusam navae-yauvanar ca.
The Original Person is one without a second, yet He never appears old; He
always appears as everfresh as a blooming youth.

The Lord’s facial expression always indicates that He is ready to show
favor and benediction to the devotees; for the nondevotees, however, He is
silent. As stated in Bhagavad-gita, although He acts equally to everyone
because He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and because all living
entities are His sons, He is especially inclined to those engaged in devo-
tional service. The same fact is confirmed here: He is always anxious to
show favor 10 the devotees. Just as the devotees are always eager to render
service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, so the Lord is also very
eager to bestow benediction upon the pure devotees.

kirtanya-tirtha-yasasarm

kirtanya— worth singing; tirtha-yaSasam—the glories of the Lord; punya-
$loka—of the devotees; yaSah-karam—enhancing the glory; dhyidyet—one
should meditate; devam—upon the Lord; samagra-aingam—all the limbs;
yavat—as much as; na—not; cyavate— deviates; manah—the mind.

TRANSLATION

The glory of the Lord is always worth singing, for His glories enhance
the glories of His devotees. One should therefore meditate upon the
Supreme Personality of Godhead and upon His devotees. One should
meditate on the eternal form of the Lord until the mind becomes fixed.

PURPORT

One has to fix his mind on the Supreme Personality of Godhead
constantly. When one is accustomed to thinking of one of the innumerable
forms of the Lord—Krsna, Visnu, Rama, Narayana, etc.—he has reached
the perfection of yoga. This is confirmed in the Brahma-samhita: a person
who has developed pure love for the Lord, and whose eyes are smeared
with the ointment of transcendental loving exchange, always sees within
his heart the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The devotees especially
see the Lord in the beautiful blackish form of Syamasundara. That is the
perfection of yoga. This yoga system should be continued until the mind
does not vacillate for a moment. Om tad visnoh paramari [0৫001 sada
pasyanti sirayah: the form of Visnu is the highest individuality and is
always visible to sages and saintly persons.

The same purpose is served when a devotee worships the form of the
Lord in the temple. There is no difference between devotional service in
the temple and meditation on the form of the Lord, since the form of the
Lord is the same whether He appears within the mind or in some concrete
element. There are eight kinds of forms recommended for the devotees to
see. The forms may be made out of sand, clay, wood or stone, they may be
contemplated within the mind, or made of jewel, metal or painted colors,
but all the forms are of the same value. It is not that one who meditates on
the form within the mind sees differently from one who worships the


--- Page 193 ---
Text 19] Kapila’s Instructions on Devotional Service 1193
form in the temple. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is absolute, and
there is therefore no difference between the two. The impersonalists, who
desire to disregard the eternal form of the Lord, imagine some round
figure. They especially prefer the ০7৫72, which also has form. In
Bhagavad-gita it is stated that omkdra is the letter form of the Lord.
Similarly, there are statue forms and painting forms of the Lord.

Another significant word in this verse is punya-sloka-yasaskaram. The
devotee 18 called punya-sloka. As one becomes purified by chanting the
holy name of the Lord, so one can become purified simply by chanting
the name of a holy devotee. The pure devotee of the Lord and the Lord
Himself are nondifferent. It is sometimes feasible to chant the name of a
holy devotee. This is a very sanctified process. Lord Caitanya was once
chanting the holy names of the gopis. He was chanting, “Gopi! Gopi!
Gopi!” when His students criticized Him: “Why are You chanting the
names of the gopis? Why not Krsna?” Lord Caitanya was irritated by the
criticism, and so there was some misunderstanding between Him and His
students. He wanted to chastise them for desiring to instruct Him on the
transcendental process of chanting.

The beauty of the Lord is that the devotees who are connected with His
activities are also glorified. Arjuna, Prahlada, Janaka Maharaja, Bali
Maharaja, and many other devotees were not even in the renounced order
of life, but were householders. Some of them, such as Prahlada Maharaja
and Bali Maharaja, were born of demoniac families. Prahlada Maharaja’s
father was a demon, and Bali Maharaja was the grandson of Prahlada
Maharaja, but still they have become famous because of their association
with the Lord. Anyone who is eternally associated with the Lord is
glorified with the Lord. The conclusion is that a perfect yogi should
always be accustomed to seeing the form of the Lord, and unless the mind
is fixed in that way, he should continue practicing yoga.

TRANSLATION

Thus always merged in devotional service, the yogi visualizes the Lord
standing, moving, lying down or sitting within him, for the pastimes of the
Supreme Lord are always beautiful and attractive.

PURPORT

The process of meditating on the form of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead within oneself and the process of chanting the glories and pastimes
of the Lord are the same. The only difference is that hearing and fixing
the mind on the pastimes of the Lord is easier than visualizing the form
of the Lord within one’s heart because as soon as one begins to think of
the Lord, especially in this age, the mind becomes disturbed, and due to
so much agitation, the process of seeing the Lord within the mind is
interrupted. When there is sound vibrated praising the transcendental
pastimes of the Lord, however, one is forced to hear. That hearing process
enters into the mind, and the practice of yoga is automatically performed.
For example, even a child can hear and derive the benefit of meditating on
the pastimes of the Lord simply by listening to a reading from the
Bhagavatam that describes the Lord as He is going to the pasturing ground
with His cows and friends. Hearing includes applying the mind. In this
age of Kali-yuga, Lord Caitanya has recommended that one should always
engage in chanting and hearing Bhagavad-gita. The Lord also says that the
mahatmas, or great souls, always engage in the process of chanting the
glories of the Lord, and just by hearing, others derive the same benefit.
Yoga necessitates meditation on the transcendental pastimes of the Lord,
whether He is standing, moving, lying down, etc.

TRANSLATION
In fixing his mind on the eternal form of the Lord, the yogi should not
take a collective view of all His limbs, but should fix the mind on each
individual limb of the Lord.
PURPORT
The word muni is very significant. Muni means one who is very expert
in mental speculation or in thinking, feeling and willing. He is not
mentioned here as a devotee or yogi. Those who try to meditate on the
form of the Lord are called munis, or less intelligent, whereas those who
render actual service to the Lord are called bhakti-yogis. The thought
process described below is for the education of the muni. In order to
convince the yogi that the Absolute Truth or Supreme Personality of
Godhead is never impersonal at any time, the following verses prescribe
observing the Lord in His personal form, limb after limb. To think of the
Lord as a whole may sometimes be impersonal; therefore, it isrecommended
here that one first think of His lotus feet, then His ankles, then the thighs,
then the waist, then the chest, then the neck, then the face and so on. One
should begin from the lotus feet and gradually rise to the upper limbs of
the transcendental body of the Lord.

TRANSLATION

The devotee should first concentrate his mind on the Lord’s lotus feet,
which are adorned with the marks of a thunderbolt, a goad, a banner and
a lotus. The splendor of their beautiful ruby nails resembles the orbit of
the moon and dispels the thick gloom of one’s heart.

PURPORT

The Mayavadi says that because one is unable to fix his mind on the
impersonal existence of the Absolute Truth, one can imagine any form he
likes and fix his mind on that imaginary form; but such a process is not
recommended here. Imagination is always imagination and results only in
further imagination.

A concrete description of the eternal form of the Lord is given here.
The Lord’s sole is depicted with distinctive lines resembling a thunderbolt,
a flag, a lotus flower and a goad. The luster of His toenails, which are
brilliantly prominent, resembles the light of the moon. If a yogi looks
upon the marks of the Lord’s sole and on the blazing brilliance of His
nails, then he can be freed from the darkness of ignorance in material
existence. This liberation is not achieved by mental speculation, but by
seeing the light emanating from the lustrous toenails of the Lord. In other
words, one has to fix his mind first on the lotus feet of the Lord if he
wants to be freed from the darkness of ignorance in material existence.

TRANSLATION

The blessed Lord Siva becomes all the more blessed by bearing on his
head the holy waters of the Ganges, which has its source in the water that
washed the Lord’s lotus feet. The Lord’s feet act like thunderbolts hurled
to shatter the mountain of sin stored in the mind of the meditating
devotee. One should therefore meditate on the lotus feet of the Lord for
along time.

PURPORT

In this verse the position of Lord Siva is specifically mentioned. The
impersonalist suggests that the Absolute Truth has no form and that one
can therefore equally imagine the form of Visnu or Lord Siva or the goddess
Durga or their son Ganesa. But actually the Supreme Personality of
Godhead is the supreme master of everyone. In the Caitanya-caritamrta it
is said: ekale isvara krsna, ara saba bhrtya: the Supreme Lord is Krsna, and
everyone else, including Lord Siva and Lord Brahma—not to mention
other demigods—is a servant of Krsna. The same principle is described
here. Lord Siva is important because he is holding on his head the holy
Ganges water which has its origin in the footwash of Lord Visnu. In the
Hari-bhakti-vilasa by Sanatana Gosvami it is said that anyone who puts the
Supreme Lord and the demigods, including Lord Siva and Lord Brahma,
on the same level, at once becomes a pasandi, or atheist. We should never
consider that the Supreme Lord Vigsnu and the demigods are on an equal
footing.

Another significant point of this verse is that the mind of the con-
ditioned soul, on account of its association with the material energy from
time immemorial, contains heaps of dirt in the form of desires to lord it


--- Page 198 ---
1198 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 28
over material nature. This dirt is like a mountain, but a mountain can be
shattered when hit by a thunderbolt. Meditating on the lotus feet of the
Lord acts like a thunderbolt on the mountain of dirt in the mind of the
yogi. If a yogi wants to shatter the mountain of dirt in his mind, he should
concentrate on the lotus feet of the Lord and not imagine something void
or impersonal. Because the dirt has accumulated like a solid mountain,
one must meditate on the lotus feet of the Lord for quite a long time. For
one who is accustomed to thinking of thelotus feet of the Lord constantly,
however, it is a different matter. The devotees are so fixed on the lotus
feet of the Lord that they do not think of anything else. Those who
practice the yoga system must meditate on the lotus feet of the Lord for
a long time after following the regulative principles and thereby controlling
the senses.

It is specifically mentioned here, bhagavatas caranaravindam: one has
to think of the lotus feet of the Lord. The Mayavadis imagine that one can
think of the lotus feet of Lord Siva or Lord Brahma or the goddess Durga
to achieve liberation, but this is not so. Bhagavatah is specifically
mentioned. Bhagavatah means of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Visnu, and no one else. Another significant phrase in this verse is sivah
ॐ४० ’bhiit. By his constitutional position, Lord Siva is always great and
auspicious, but since he has accepted on his head the Ganges water which
emanated from the lotus feet of the Lord, he has become even more
auspicious and important. The stress is on the lotus feet of the Lord. A
relationship with the lotus feet of the Lord can even enhance the impor-
tance of Lord Siva, what to speak of other, ordinary living entities.

TRANSLATION

The yogi should fix in his heart the activities of Laksmi, the goddess of
fortune, who is worshiped by all demigods and is the mother of the
supreme person, Brahma. She can always be found massaging the legs
and thighs of the transcendental Lord, very carefully serving Him in this
way.

PURPORT

Brahma is the appointed lord of the universe. Because his father is
Garbhodakadayi Visnu, Laksmi, the goddess of fortune, is automatically
his mother. Laksmiji is worshiped by all demigods as well as by the in-
habitants of other planets. Human beings are also eager to receive favor
from the goddess of fortune. Laksmi is always engaged in massaging the
legs and thighs of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana, who is
lying on the ocean of Garbha within the universe. Brahma is described
here as the son of the goddess of fortune, but actually he was not born of
her womb. Brahma takes his birth in the abdomen of the Lord Himself.
A lotus flower grows from the abdomen of Garbhodakasayi Visnu, and
Brahma is born there. Therefore Laksmiji’s massaging of the thighs of the
Lord should not be taken as the behavior of an ordinary wife. The Lord is
transcendental to the behavior of the ordinary male and female. The word
abhavasya is very significant, for itindicates that He could produce Brahma
without the assistance of the goddess of fortune.

Since transcendental behavior is different from mundane behavior, it
should not be taken that the Lord receives service from His wife just as a
demigod or human being might receive service from his wife. It is advised
here that the yogi always keep this picture in his heart. The devotee always
thinks of this relationship between Laksmi and Narayana; therefore he does
not meditate on the mental plane as impersonalists and voidists do.

Bhavah means one who accepts a material body, and abhavah means one
who does not accept a material body but descends in the original spiritual
body. Lord Narayana is not born of anything material. Matter is generated


--- Page 200 ---
1200 Srimad-Bhagavatam [ Canto 3, Ch. 28
from matter, but He is not born of matter. Brahma is born after the crea-
tion, but since the Lord existed before the creation, He therefore has no
material body.

TRANSLATION
Next, the yogi should fix his mind in meditation on the Personality of
Godhead’s thighs, the storehouse of all energy. The Lord’s thighs are
whitish blue, like the luster of the linseed flower, and appear most graceful
when the Lord is carried on the shoulders of Garuda. Also the yogi should
contemplate upon His rounded hips, which are encircled by a girdle that
rests on the exquisite yellow silk cloth that extends down to His ankles.
PURPORT
The Personality of Godhead is the reservoir of all strength, and His
strength rests on the thighs of His transcendental body. His whole body is
full of opulences: all riches, all strength, all fame, all beauty, all knowledge
and all renunciation. The yogi is advised to meditate upon the transcen-
dental form of the Lord, beginning from the soles of the feet and then
gradually rising to the knees, to the thighs, and finally arriving at the face.


--- Page 201 ---
Text 25] Kapila’s Instructions on Devotional Service 1201
The system of meditating on the Supreme Personality of Godhead begins
from His feet.

The description of the transcendental form of the Lord is exactly
represented in the arca-vigraha, the statue in the temples. Generally the
lower part of the body of the statue of the Lord is covered with yellow
silk. That is the Vaikuntha dress, or the dress the Lord wears in the
spiritual sky. This cloth extends down to the Lord’s ankles. Thus, since
the yogi has so many transcendental objectives on which to meditate,
there is no reason for his meditating on something imaginary, as is the
practice of the so-called yogis whose objective is impersonal.

TRANSLATION

The yogi should then meditate on His moonlike navel in the center of
His abdomen. From His navel, which is the foundation of the entire
universe, sprang the lotus stem containing all the different planetary
systems. The lotus is the residence of Brahma, the first created being. In
the same way, the yogi should concentrate his mind on the Lord's
nipples, which resemble a pair of the most exquisite emeralds and which


--- Page 202 ---
1202 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 28
appear whitish because of the rays of the milk-white pearl necklaces
adorning His chest.

PURPORT

The yogi is advised next to meditate upon the navel of the Lord, which
is the foundation of all material creation. Just as a child is connected to
his mother by the umbilical cord, so the first-born living creature, Brahma,
by the supreme will of the Lord, is connected to the Lord by a lotus stem.
In the previous verse it was stated that the goddess of fortune, Laksmi,
who engages in massaging the legs, ankles and thighs of the Lord, is called
the mother of Brahma, but actually Brahma is born from the abdomen of
the Lord, not from the abdomen of his mother. These are inconceivable
conceptions of the Lord, and one should not think materially, “How can
the father give birth to a child?”

It is explained in the Brahma-sarmhita that each limb of the Lord has
the potency of every other limb; because everything is spiritual, His parts
are not conditioned. The Lord can see with His ears. The material ear can
hear but cannot see, but we understand from the Brahma-sarhita that the
Lord can also see with His ears and hear with His eyes. Any organ of His
transcendental body can function as any other organ. His abdomen is the
foundation of all the planetary systems. Brahma holds the post of the
creator of all planetary systems, but his engineering energy is generated
from the abdomen of the Lord. Any creative function in the universe
always has a direct connecting link with the Lord. The necklace of pearls
which decorates the upper portion of the Lord’s body is also spiritual, and
therefore the yogi is advised to gaze at the whitish luster of the pearls
decorating His chest.

TRANSLATION

The yogi should then meditate on the chest of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, the abode of goddess Maha-Laksmi. The Lord’s chest is the
source of all transcendental pleasure for the mind and full satisfaction for
the eyes. The yogi should then imprint on his mind the neck of the
Personality of Godhead, who is adored by the entire universe. The
neck of the Lord serves to enhance the beauty of the Kaustubha gem,
which hangs on His chest.

PURPORT

In the Upanisads it is said that the various energies of the Lord are
working to create, destroy and maintain. These inconceivable varieties of
energy are stored in the bosom of the Lord. As people generally say, God
is all-powerful. That prowess is represented by Maha-Laksmi, the
reservoir of all energies, who is situated on the bosom of the transcenden-
tal form of the Lord. The yogi who can meditate perfectly on that spot
on the transcendental form of the Lord can derive many material powers,
which comprise the eight perfections of the yoga system.

It is stated herein that the beauty of the neck of the Lord enhances
the beauty of the Kaustubha gem rather than vice versa. The gem itself
becomes more beautiful because it is situated on the neck of the Lord. A
yogi is therefore recommended to meditate upon the Lord’s neck. The
Lord’s transcendental form can either be meditated upon in the mind or
placed in a temple in the form of a statue and decorated in such a way
that everyone can contemplate it. Temple worship, therefore, is meant
for persons who are not so advanced that they can meditate upon the
form of the Lord. There is no difference between constantly visiting the
temple and directly seeing the transcendental form of the Lord; they are
of equal value. The advantageous position of the yogi is that he can sit
anywhere in a solitary place and meditate upon the form of the Lord. A


--- Page 204 ---
1204. Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 28
less advanced person, however, has to go to the temple, and as long as he
does not go to the temple he is unable to see the form of the Lord. Either
by hearing, seeing or meditating, the objective is the transcendental form
of the Lord; there is no question of voidness or impersonalism. The Lord
can bestow the blessings of transcendental pleasure upon either the
visitor of the temple, the meditator-yogt or one who hears about the
Lord’s transcendental form from scriptures like the Srimad-Bhagavatam or
Bhagavad-gita. There are nine processes for executing devotional service,
of which smaranam, or meditation, is one. Yogis take advantage of the
process of smaranam, whereas bhakti-yogis take special advantage of the
process of hearing and chanting.

TRANSLATION
The yogi should further meditate upon the Lord’s four arms, which are

the source of all the powers of the demigods who control the various
functions of material nature. Then the yogi should concentrate on the
polished ornaments which were burnished by Mount Mandara as it
revolved. He should also duly contemplate the Lord’s discus, the
Sudarsana cakra, which contains 1,000 spokes and a dazzling luster, as
well as the conch, which looks like a swan in His lotuslike palm.


--- Page 205 ---
Text 28] Kapila’s Instructions on Devotional Service 1205
PURPORT

All departments of law and order emanate from the arms of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. The law and order of the universe is directed by
different demigods, and it is here said to emanate from the Lord’s arms.
Mandara Hill is mentioned here because when the ocean was churned by
the demons on one side and the demigods on the other, Mandara Hill was
taken as the churning rod. The Lord in His tortoise incarnation became
the pivot for the churning rod, and thus His ornaments were polished by
the turning of Mandara Hill. In other words, the ornaments on the arms
of the Lord are as brilliant and lustrous as if they had been polished very
recently. The wheel in the hand of the Lord, called the Sudarsana cakra,
has 1,000 spokes. The yogi is advised to meditate upon each of the spokes.
He should meditate upon each and every one of the component parts of
the transcendental form of the Lord.

The yogi should meditate upon His club, which is named Kaumodaki

and is very dear to Him. This club smashes the demons, who are always

1206 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 28
inimical soldiers, and is smeared with their blood. One should also concen-
trate on the nice garland on the neck of the Lord, which is always
surrounded by bumblebees, with their nice buzzing sound, and one should
meditate upon the pearl necklace on the Lord’s neck, which is considered
to be the pure living entities who are always engaged in His service.
PURPORT
The yogi must contemplate the different parts of the transcendental
body of the Lord. Here it is stated that the constitutional position of the
living entities should be understood. There are two kinds of living entities
mentioned here. One is called the arati. They are averse to understanding
the pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For them, the Lord
appears with His hand clutching the terrible mace, which is always smeared
with bloodstains from His killing of demons. Demons are also sons of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. As stated in Bhagavad-gita, all the
different specics of living entities are sons of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. There are, however, two classes of living entities, who act in
two different ways. The Supreme Lord keeps those living entities who
are pure on His neck, as one protects the jewels and pearls on the bosom
and neck of one’s body. Those living entities in pure Krsna consciousness
are symbolized by the pearls on His neck. Those who are demons. and are
inimical towards the pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are
punished by His mace, which is always smeared with the blood of such
fallen living entities. The club of the Lord is very dear to Him because He
uses this instrument to smash the bodies of the demons and mix their
blood. As mud is kneaded with water and earth, so the earthly bodies of
the enemies of the Lord, or the atheists, are smashed by the club of the
Lord, which becomes muddied with the blood of such demons.

TRANSLATION

The yogi should then meditate on the lotuslike countenance of the
Lord, who presents His different forms in this world out of compassion
for the anxious devotees. His nose is prominent, and His crystal-clear
cheeks are illuminated by the oscillation of His glittering alligator-shaped
earrings.

PURPORT

The Lord descends to the material world out of His deep compassion
for His devotees. There are two reasons for the Lord’s appearance or
incarnation in the material world. Whenever there is a discrepancy in the
discharge of religious principles and prominence of irreligion, the Lord
descends for the protection of the devotees and the destruction of the
nondevotees. When He appears, His main purpose is to give solace to His
devotees. He does not have to come Himself to destroy the demons, for
He has many agents; even the external energy, maya, has sufficient strength
to kill them. But when He comes to show compassion to His devotees, He
kills the nondevotees as a matter of course.

The Lord appears in the particular form loved by a particular type of
devotee. There are millions of forms of the Lord, but they are one
Absolute. As stated in the Brahma-sambhita, advaitam acyutam anadim
ananta-ripam: all the different forms of the Lord are one, but some
devotees want to see Him in the form of Radha and Krsna, others prefer
Him as Sita and Ramacandra, others would see Him as Laksmi-Narayana
and others want to see Him as four-handed Narayana, Vasudeva. The Lord
has innumerable forms, and He appears in a particular form as preferred by
a particular type of devotee. A yogi is advised to meditate upon the forms
that are approved by devotees. A yogi cannot imagine a form for
meditation. Those so-called yogis who manufacture a circle or target are


--- Page 208 ---
1208 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 28
engaged in nonsense. Actually, a yogi must meditate upon the form of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead that has been experienced by the Lord’s
pure devotees. Yogi means devotee. Yogis who are not actually pure
devotees should follow in the footsteps of devotees. It is especially
mentioned here that the yogi should meditate upon the form which is thus
approved; he cannot manufacture a form of the Lord.

TRANSLATION
The yogi then meditates upon the beautiful face of the Lord, which is
adorned with curly hair and decorated by lotuslike eyes and dancing
eyebrows. A lotus surrounded by swarming bees and a pair of swimming
fish would be put to shame by its elegance.
PURPORT
One important statement here is dhydyen manomayam. Manomayam
is not imagination. Impersonalists think that the yogi can imagine any
form that he likes, but, as stated here, the yogi must meditate upon the
form of the Lord which is experienced by devotees. Devotees never


--- Page 209 ---
Text 31] Kapila’s Instructions on Devotional Service 1209
imagine a form of the Lord. They are not satisfied by something imaginary.
The Lord has different eternal forms; each devotee likes a particular form
and thus engages himself in the service of the Lord by worshiping that
form. The Lord’s form is depicted in different ways according to
scriptures. As already discussed, there are eight kinds of representations of
the original form of the Lord. These representations can be produced by
the use of clay, stone, wood, paint, sand, etc., depending upon the
resources of the devotee.

Manomayam is a carving of the form of the Lord within the mind.
This is included as one of the eight different carvings of the form of the
Lord. It is not imagination. Meditation on the actual form of the Lord may
be manifested in different manners, but it should not be concluded that
one has to imagine a form. There are two comparisons in this verse: first,
the Lord’s face is compared to a lotus, and then His black hair is com-
pared to humming bees swarming around the lotus, and His two eyes are
compared to two fish swimming about. A lotus flower on the water is very
beautiful when surrounded by humming bees and fish. The Lord’s face is
self-sufficient and complete. His beauty defies the natural beauty of alotus.

The yogis should contemplate with full devotion upon the compassionate
glances frequently cast by the Lord’s eyes, for they soothe the most
fearful threefold agonies of His devotees. His glances, accompanied by
loving smiles, are full of abundant grace.
PURPORT
As long as one is in conditional life, in the material body, it is natural
that he will suffer from anxieties and agonies. One cannot avoid the
influence of material energy, even when one is on the transcendental
plane. Sometimes disturbances come, but the agonies and anxieties of the
devotees are at once mitigated when they think of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead in His beautiful form or the smiling face of the Lord. The
Lord bestows innumerable favors upon His devotee, and the greatest
manifestation of His grace is His smiling face, which is full of compassion
for His pure devotees.

ocean of tears caused by intense grief. He should also meditate on His
arched eyebrows, which are manifested by His internal potency in order
to charm the sex god for the good of the sages.

PURPORT

The entire universe is full of miseries, and therefore the inhabitants of
this material universe are always shedding tears out of intense grief. There
is a great ocean of water made from such tears, but for one who surrenders
unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the ocean of tears is at once
dried up. One need only see the charming smile of the Supreme Lord. In
other words, the bereavement of material existence immediately subsides
when one sees the charming smile of the Lord.

It is stated in this verse that the charming eyebrows of the Lord are so
fascinating that they cause one to forget the charms of sense attraction.
The conditioned souls are shackled to material existence because they are
captivated by the charms of sense gratification, especially sex life. The
sex god is called makara-dhvaja. The charming brows of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead protect the sages and devotees from being
charmed by material lust and sex attraction. Yamunacarya, a great
dcdrya, said that ever since he had seen the charming pastimes of the Lord,
the charms of sex life had become abominable for him, and the mere
thought of sex enjoyment would cause him to spit and turn his face. Thus
if anyone wants to be aloof from sex attraction he must see the charming
smile and fascinating eyebrows of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION
With devotion steeped in love and affection, the yogi should meditate
within the core of his heart upon the laughter of Lord Visnu. The
laughter of Visnu is so captivating that it can be easily meditated
upon. When the Supreme Lord is laughing one can see His small teeth,
which resemble jasmine buds rendered rosy by the splendor of His lips.
Once devoting his mind to this, the yogi should no longer desire to see
anything else.
PURPORT
It is recommended that the yogi visualize the laughter of the Lord
after studying His smile very carefully. These particular descriptions of
meditation on the smile, laughter, face, lips and teeth all indicate con-
clusively that God is not impersonal. It is described herein that one should
meditate on the laughter or smiling of Visnu. There is no other activity that
can completely cleanse the heart of the devotee. The exceptional beauty
of the laughter of Lord Visnu is that when He smiles His small teeth,
which resemble the buds of jasmine flowers, at once become reddish,
reflecting His rosy lips. If the yogi is able to place the beautiful face of the
Lord in the core of his heart, then he will be completely satisfied. In other
words, when one is absorbed in seeing the beauty of the Lord within
himself, the material attraction can no longer disturb him.

TRANSLATION

By following this course, the yogi gradually develops pure love for the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari. In the course of his progress in
devotional service, the hairs on his body stand erect through excessive
joy, and he is constantly bathed in a stream of tears occasioned by
intense love. Gradually, even the mind which he used as a means to
attract the Lord, as one attracts a fish to a hook, withdraws from material
activity.

PURPORT

Here it is clearly mentioned that meditation, which is an action of the
mind, is not the perfect stage of samadhi or absorption. In the beginning
the mind is employed in attracting the form of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, but in the higher stages there is no question of using the
mind. A devotee becomes accustomed to serving the Supreme Lord by
purification of his senses. In other words, the yoga principles of medita-
tion are required as long as one is not situated in pure devotional service.
The mind is used to purify the senses, but when the senses are purified
by meditation, there is no need to sit in a particular place and to try to
meditate upon the form of the Lord. One becomes so habituated that he
automatically engages in the personal service of the Lord. When the mind
forcibly is engaged upon the form of the Lord, this is called nirbija-yoga,
or lifeless yoga, for the yogl does not automatically engage in the personal
service of the Lord. But when he is constantly thinking of the Lord, that
is called sabija-yoga or living yoga. One has to be promoted to the plat-
form of living yoga.

One should engage in the service of the Lord twenty-four hours a day,
as confirmed in the Brahma-sarhita. The stage of premaiijana-cchurita
can be attained by developing complete love. When one’s love for the


--- Page 214 ---
1214 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 28
Supreme Personality of Godhead in devotional service is fully developed,
he always sees the Lord, even without artificially meditating on His form.
His vision is divine because he has no other engagement. At this stage of
spiritual realization it is not necessary to engage the mind artificially.
Since the meditation which is recommended in the lower stages is a means
to come to the platform of devotional service, those who are already
engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord are above such
meditation. This stage of perfection is called Krsna consciousness.

TRANSLATION
When the mind is thus completely freed from all material contamination
and detached from material objectives, it is just like the flame of a lamp.
At that time the mind is actually dovetailed with that of the Supreme Lord
and is experienced as one with Him because it is freed from the interactive
flow of the material qualities.
PURPORT
In the material world the activities of the mind are acceptance and
rejection. As long as the mind is in material consciousness, it must be


--- Page 215 ---
Text 36] Kapila’s Instructions on Devotional Service 1215
forcibly trained to accept meditation on the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, but when one is actually elevated to loving the Supreme Lord,
then the mind is automatically absorbed in thought of the Lord. In such
a position a yogi has no other thought than to serve the Lord. This
dovetailing of the mind with the desires of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead is called nirvana, or makingthe mind one with theSupreme Lord.

The best example of nirvana is cited in Bhagavad-gita. In the beginning
the mind of Arjuna deviated from Krsna’s. Krsna wanted Arjuna to fight,
but Arjuna did not want to, so there was disagreement. But after hearing
Bhagavad-gita from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Arjuna dove-
tailed his mind with Krsna’s desire. This is called oneness. This oneness,
however, did not cause Arjuna and Krsna to lose their individualities. The
Mayavadi philosophers cannot understand this. They think that oneness
necessitates loss of individuality. Actually, however, we find in Bhagavad-
gita that individuality is not lost. When the mind is completely purified in
love of Godhead, then the mind becomes the mind of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. The mind at that time does not act separately,
nor does it act without inspiration to fulfill the desire of the Lord. The
individual liberated soul has no other activity. Pratinivrtta-guna-pravahah.
In the conditioned state the mind is always engaged in activity impelled
by the three modes of the material world, but in the transcendental stage,
the material modes cannot disturb the mind of the devotee. The devotee
has no other concern than to satisfy the desires of the Lord. That is the
highest stage of perfection, called nirvana or nirvana-mulkti. At this stage
the mind becomes completely free from material desire.

Yatharcih. Arcih means flame. When a lamp is broken or the oil is
finished, we see that the flame of the lamp goes out, but according to
scientific understanding, the flame is not extinguished; it is conserved.
This is conservation of energy. Similarly, when the mind stops function-
ing on the material platform, it is conserved in the activities of the Supreme
Lord. The Mayavadi philosophers’ conception of cessation of the
functions of the mind is explained here: cessation of the mental functions
means cessation of activities conducted under the influence of the three
modes of material nature.

TRANSLATION

Thus situated in the highest transcendental stage, the mind ceases from
all material reaction and becomes situated in its own glory, transcendental
to all material conceptions of happiness and distress. At that time the
yogi realizes the truth of his relationship with the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. He discovers that pleasure and pain as well as their interactions,
which he attributed to his own self, are actually due to the false ego, which
is a product of ignorance.

PURPORT

Forgetfulness of one’s relationship with the Supreme Personality of
Godhead is a product of ignorance. By yoga practice onc can eradicate
this ignorance of thinking oneself independent of the Supreme Lord.
One’s actual relationship is eternally that of love. The living entity is
meant Lo render transcendental loving service to the Lord. Forgetfulness
of that sweel relationship is called ignorance, and in ignorance one is
impelled by the three material modes of nature to think himself the
enjoyer. When the devotees mind is purified and he understands that his
mind has to be dovetailed with the desires of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, that is the perfectional, transcendental stage, which is beyond
the perception of material distress and happiness.

As long as one acts on his own account, he is subjected Lo all the material


--- Page 217 ---
Text 37] Kapila’s Instructions on Devotional Service 1217
perceptions of so-called happiness and distress. Actually there is no happi-
ness. Just as there is no happiness in any of the activities of a madman, so
in material activities the mental concoctions of happiness and distress are
false. Actually everything is distress.

When the mind is dovetailed to act according to the desire of the
Lord, that is the transcendental stage. The desire to lord it over material
nature is the cause of ignorance, and when that desire is completely
extinguished and the desires are dovetailed with those of the Supreme
Lord, that is the perfectional stage. Upalabdha-paratma-kasthah.
Upalabdha means realization. Realization necessarily indicates individual-
ity. In the perfectional, liberated stage, there is actual realization.
Nivrttya means that the living entity keeps his individuality; oneness
means that he realizes happiness in the happiness of the Supreme Lord.
In the Supreme Lord there is nothing but happiness. Anandamayo’bhyasat:
the Lord is by nature full of transcendental happiness. In the liberated
stage, oneness with the Supreme Lord means that one has no realization
other than happiness. But the individual still exists, otherwise this word
upalabdha, individual realization of transcendental happiness, would not
have been used.

PURPORT
This stage of life is explained by Rupa Gosvami in his Bhakti-rasamrta-
sindhu. A person whose mind is completely dovetailed with the desire of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and who engages one hundred
percent in the service of the Lord, forgets his material bodily demands.

TRANSLATION
The body of such a liberated yogi, along with the senses, is taken charge
of by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and it functions until its
destined activities are finished. Because the liberated devotee, being awake
to his constitutional position and thus situated in samadhi, the highest
perfectional stage of yoga, does not accept the by-products of the material


--- Page 219 ---
Text 39] Kapila’s Instructions on Devotional Service 1219
body as his own, he considers his bodily activities to be like the activities
of a body in a dream.
PURPORT
The following questions may be posed. As long as the liberated soul is
in contact with the body, why don’t the bodily activities affect him?
Doesn’t he actually become contaminated by the action and reaction of
material activities? In answer to such questions, this verse explains that
the material body of a liberated soul is taken charge of by the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. It is not acting due to the living force of theliving
entity; it is simply acting as a reaction to past activities. Even after being
switched off, an electric fan moves for some time. That movement is not
due to the electric current, but is a continuation of the last movement;
similarly, although a liberated soul appears to be acting just like an ordi-
nary man, his actions are to be accepted as the continuation of past
activities. In a dream one may see himself expanded through many bodies,
but when awake he can understand that those bodies were all false.
Similarly, although a liberated soul has the by-products of the body—
children, wife, house, etc.—he does not identify himself with those bodily
expansions. He knows that they are all products of the material dream. The
gross body is made of the gross elements of matter, and the subtle body is
made of mind, intelligence, ego and contaminated consciousness. If one
can accept the subtle body of a dream asfalse and not identify oneself with
that body, then certainly an awake person need not identify with the gross
body. As one who is awake has no connection with the activities of the
body in a dream, an awakened liberated soul has no connection with the
activities of the present body. In other words, because he is acquainted
with his constitutional position, he never accepts the bodily concept of
life.

TRANSLATION

Because of great affection for family and wealth, one accepts a son and
some money as his own, and due to affection for the material body, one
thinks that it is his. But actually, as one can understand that his family and
wealth are different from him, so the liberated soul can understand that
he and his body are not the same.

PURPORT

The status of real knowledge is explained in this verse. There are many
children, but we accept some children as our sons and daughters because of
our affection for them, although we know very well that these children are
different from us. Similarly, because of great affection for money, we
accept some amount of wealth in the bank as ours. In the same way, we
claim that the body is ours because of affection for it.I say that it is “my”
body. I then exlend that possessive concept and say, “It is my hand, my
leg,” and further, “It is my bank balance, my son, my daughter.” But
actually T know that the son and the money are separate from me. It is the
same with the body;l am separate from my body. It is a question of under-
standing, and the proper understanding is called pratibuddha. By obtaining
knowledge in devotional service, or Krsna consciousness, one can become
a liberated soul.

and light of the fire are separate, although one cannot differentiate fire
from heat and light.

PURPORT
A clear conception of the complete whole is given herewith. The living
entity is different from the material elements, and the supreme living
entity, the Personality of Godhead, who is the creator of the material
elements, is also different from the individual living entity. This philosophy


--- Page 222 ---
1222 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 28
is propounded by Lord Caitanya as acintya-bhedabheda-tattva. Everything
is simultaneously one with and different from everything clse. The cosmic
manifestation created by the Supreme Lord by His material energy is also
simultaneously different and nondifferent from Him. The material energy
is nondifferent from the Supreme Lord, but al the same time, because
that energy is acting in a different way, it is different from Him. Similarly,
the individual living entity is one with and different from the Supreme
Lord. This “simultaneously one and different” philosophy is the perfect
conclusion of the Bhdgavata school, as confirmed here by Kapiladeva.

Living entities are compared to the sparks of a fire. As stated in the
previous verse, fire, flame, smoke and firewood are combined together.
Here the living entity, the material elements and the Supreme Personality
of Godhead are combined together. The exact position of the living entities
is just like that of the sparks of a fire; they are part and parcel. The
material energy is compared to the smoke. The fire is also part and parcel
of the Supreme Lord. In the Vispu Purana it is said that whatever we can
see or experience, either in the material or spiritual world, is an expansion
of the different energies of the Supreme Lord. As fire distributes its light
and heat from one place, so the Supreme Personality of Godhead distributes
His different energies all over His creation.

The four principles of the Vaisnava philosophic doctrine are
$uddhadvaita, purified oneness, dvaitadvaita, simultaneous oneness and
difference, visistadvaita and dvaita. All four principles of Vaignava philoso-
phy are based on the thesis of Srimad-Bhagavatam explained in these two
verses.

Text 43] Kapila’s Instructions on Devotional Service 1223
TRANSLATION

A yogi should see the same soul in all manifestations, for all that exists
is a manifestation of different energies of the Supreme. In this way the
devotee should see all living entities without distinction. That is realization
of the Supreme Soul.

PURPORT

As stated in the Brahma-samhita, not only does the Supreme Soul enter
each and every universe, but He enters even the atoms. The Supreme
Soul is present everywhere in the dormant stage, and when one can see the
presence of the Supreme Soul everywhere, he is liberated from material
designations.

The word sarva-bhiitesu is to be understood as follows. There are four
different divisions of species—living entities which sprout from the earth,
living entities born of fermentation or germination, living entities which
come from eggs, and living entities which come from the embryo. These
four divisions of living entities are expanded in 8,400,000 species of life. A
person who is freed from material designations can see the same quality of
spirit present everywhere or in every manifested living entity. Less intelli-
gent men think that plants and grass grow out of the earth automatically,
but one who is actually intelligent and has realized the self can see that
this growth is not automatic; the cause is the soul, and the forms come
out in material bodies under different conditions. By fermentation in the
laboratory many germs are born, but this is due to the presence of the soul.
The material scientist thinks that eggs are lifeless, but that is not a fact.
From Vedic scripture we can understand that living entities in different
forms are generated under different conditions. Birds evolve from eggs,
and beasts and human beings are born from the embryo. The perfect vision
of the yogi or devotee is that he sees the presence of the living entity
everywhere.

TRANSLATION

As fire is exhibited in different forms of wood, so, under different
conditions of the modes of material nature, the pure spirit soul manifests
itself in different bodies.

PURPORT

It is to be understood that the body is designated. Prakrti is an interaction
by the three modes of material nature, and according to these modes,
someone has a small body, and someone has a very large body. For exam-
ple, the fire in a big piece of wood appears to be very big, and in a stick
the fire appears to be small. Actually, the quality of fire is the same
everywhere, but the manifestation of material nature is such that according
to the fuel, the fire appears to be bigger and smaller. Similarly, the soul
in the universal body, although of the same quality, is different from the
soul in the smaller body.

The small particles of soul are just like sparks of the larger soul. The
greatest soul is the Supersoul, but the Supersoul is quantitatively different
from the small soul. The Supersoul is described in the Vedic literature as
the supplier of all necessities of the smaller soul (nityo nityanam). One
who understands this distinction between the Supersoul and the indi-
vidual soul is above lamentation and is in a peaceful position. When the
smaller soul thinks himself quantitatively as big as the larger soul, he is
under the spell of maya, for that is not his constitutional position. No one
can become the greater soul simply by mental speculation.

The smallness or greatness of different souls is described in the Vardha
Purana as svarnsa-vibhinnamsa. The svarhsa soul is the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, and the vibhinnarhsa souls, or small particles, are eternally
small particles, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (mamaivamso jiva-loke
jiva-bhiitah sandatanah). The small living entities are eternally part and
parcel, and therefore it is not possible for them to be quantitatively as
great as the Supersoul.

TRANSLATION

Thus the yogi can be in the self-realized position after conquering the
insurmountable spell of maya, who presents herself as both the cause and
effect of this material manifestation and is therefore very difficult to
understand.

PURPORT

It is stated in Bhagavad-gita that the spell of maya, which covers the
knowledge of the living entity, is insurmountable. However, one who
surrenders unto Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, can conquer
this seemingly insurmountable spell of maya. Here also it is stated that
the daivi prakrti or the external energy of the Supreme Lord, is dur-
vibhavya, very difficult to understand and very difficult to conquer. One
must, however, conquer this insurmountable spell of maya, and this is
possible, by the grace of the Lord, when God reveals Himself to the
surrendered soul. It is also stated here, svardpenavatisthate. Svaripa
means that one has to know that he is not the Supreme Soul, but rather,
part and parcel of the Supreme Soul; that is self-realization. To think
falsely that one is the Supreme Soul and that he is all-pervading is not
svaripa. This is not realization of his actual position. The real position is
that he is part and parcel. It is recommended here that one remain in that
position of actual self-realization. In Bhagavad-gita this understanding is
defined as Brahman realization.

After Brahman realization, one can engage in the activities of Brahman.
As long as one is not self-realized, he engages in activities based on false
identification with the body. When one is situated in his real self, then
the activities of Brahman realization begin. The Mayavadi philosophers
say that after Brahman realization, all activities stop, but that is not
actually so. If the soul is so active in its abnormal condition, existing
under the covering of matter, how can one deny its activity when free?
An example may be cited here. If a man in a diseased condition is very


--- Page 226 ---
1226 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 28
active, how can one imagine that when he is free from the disease he will
be inactive? Naturally the conclusion is that when one is free from all
disease, his activities are pure. It may be said that the activities of Brahman
realization are different from those of conditional life, but that does not
stop activity. This is indicated in Bhagavad-gita (Bg. 18.54): After one
realizes oneself to be Brahman, devotional service begins. Mad-bhaktim
labhate param: After Brahman realization, one canengage in the devotional
service of the Lord. Therefore devotional service of the Lord is activity
in Brahman realization.

For those who engage in devotional service there is no spell of maya,
and their situation is all-perfect. The duty of the living entity, as a part
and parcel of the whole, is to render devotional service to the whole.
That is the ultimate perfection of life.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Third Canto, Twenty-
eighth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “Lord Kapila’s
Instructions on the Execution of Devotional Service.”

1228 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 29
TRANSLATION

Devahiiti inquired: My dear Lord, You have already very scientifically
described the symptoms of the total material nature and the characteristics
of the spirit according to the sarikhya system of philosophy. Now I shall
request You to explain the path of devotional service, which is the ultimate
end of all philosophical systems.

PURPORT

In this Twenty-ninth Chapter, the glories of devotional service are
elaborately explained, and the influence of time on the conditioned
soul is also described. The purpose of elaborately describing the influence
of time is to detach the conditioned soul from his material activities,
which are considered to be simply a waste of time. In the previous
chapter, material nature, the spirit and the Supreme Lord or Supersoul
are analytically studied, and in this chapter the principles of bhakti-yoga
or devotional service—the execution of activities in the eternal relationship
between the living entities and the Personality of Godhead—are explained.

Bhakti-yoga, devotional service, is the basic principle of all systems of
philosophy; all philosophy which does not aim for devotional service to
the Lord is considered to be merely mental speculation. But of course
bhakti-yoga with no philosophical basis is more or less sentiment. There
are two classes of men. Some consider themselves intellectually advanced
and simply speculate and meditate, and others are sentimental and have
no philosophical basis for their propositions. Neither of these can achieve
the highest goal of life—or, if they do, it will take them many, many years.
Vedic literature therefore suggests that there are three elements—namely
the Supreme Lord, the living entity and their eternal relationship—and the
goal of life is to follow the principles of bhakti or devotional service and
ultimately attain to the planet of the Supreme Lord in full devotion and
love as an eternal servitor of the Lord.

Sankhya philosophy is the analytical study of all existence. One has to
understand everything by examining its nature and characteristics. This is
called acquirement of knowledge. But one should not simply acquire knowl-
edge without reaching the goal of life or the basic principle for acquiring
knowledge—bhakti-yoga. If we give up bhakti-yoga and simply busy our-
selves in the analytical study of the nature of things as they are, then the
result will be practically nil. It is stated in the Bhagavatam that such
engagement is something like husking a paddy. There is no use beating the
husk if the grain has already been removed. By the scientific study of

material nature, the living entity and the Supersoul, one has to understand
the basic principle of devotional service to the Lord.

Devahiiti continued: My dear Lord, please also describe in detail, both
for myself and for people in general, the continual process of birth and
death, for by hearing of such calamities we may become detached from the
activities of this material world.
PURPORT
In this verse the word sariisrtih is very important. Sreyah-srti means the
prosperous path of advancement towards the Supreme Personality of God-
head, and sariisrti means the continued journey on the path of birth and
death towards the darkest region of material existence. People who have no
knowledge of this material world, God and their actual intimate relation-
ship with Him are actually going to the darkest region of material
existence in the name of progress in the material advancement of civiliza-
tion. To enter the darkest region of material existence means to enter into
a species of life other than the human species. Ignorant men do not know
that after this life they are completely under the grip of material nature
and will be offered a life which may not be very congenial. How a living
entity gets different kinds of bodies will be explained in the next chapter.
This continual change of bodies in birth and death is called sarisara.

bhakti-yoga, devotional service.

TRANSLATION

Please also describe eternal time, which is a representation of Your
form and by whose influence people in general engage in the performance
of pious activities.

PURPORT

However ignorant one may be regarding the path of good fortune and
the path down to the darkest region of ignorance, everyone is aware of the
influence of eternal time, which devours all the effects of our material
activities. The body is born at a certain time, and immediately the influence
of time acts upon it. From the date of the birth of the body, the influence
of death is also acting; the advancement of age entails the influence of
time on the body. If a man is thirty or fifty years old, then the influence
of time has already devoured thirty or fifty years of the duration of his
life.

Everyone is conscious of the last stage of life, when he will meet the
cruel hands of death, but some consider their age and circumstances,
concern themselves with the influence of time, and thus engage in pious
activities so that in the future they will not be put into a low family or an

animal species. Generally, people are attached to sense enjoyment and so
aspire for life on the heavenly planets. Therefore, they engage themselves
in charitable or other pious activities, but actually, as stated in Bhagavad-
gita, one cannot get relief from the chain of birth and death even if he goes
to the highest planet, Brahmaloka, because the influence of time is present
everywhere within this material world. In the spiritual world, however, the
time factor has no influence.

TRANSLATION
My dear Lord, You are just like the sun, for You illuminate the darkness
of the conditional life of the living entities. Because their eyes of knowledge
are not open, they are sleeping eternally in that darkness without Your
shelter, and therefore they are falsely engaged by the actions and reactions
of their material activities, and they appear to be very fatigued.
PURPORT
It appears that Srimati Devahiiti, the glorious mother of Lord
Kapiladeva, is very compassionate for the regrettable condition of people


--- Page 232 ---
1232 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 29
in general, who, not knowing the goal of life, are sleeping in the darkness
of illusion. It is the general feeling of the Vaisnava, or devotee of the Lord,
that he should awaken them. Similarly, Devahuti is requesting her glorious
son to illuminate the lives of the conditioned souls so that their most
regrettable conditional life may be ended. The Lord is described herein as
yoga-bhaskara, the sun of the system of all yoga. Devahiiti has already
requested her glorious son to describe bhakti-yoga, and the Lord has
described bhakti-yoga as the ultimate yoga system.

Bhakti-yoga is the sunlike illumination for delivering the conditioned
souls, whose general condition is described here. They have no eyes to see
their own interests. They do not know that the goal of life is not to increase
the material necessitics of existence, because the body will not exist more
than a few years. The living beings are eternal, and they have their eternal
need. If one engages only in caring for the necessities of the body, not
caring for the eternal necessities of life, then he is a part of a civilization
whose advancement puts the living entities in the darkest region of igno-
rance. Sleeping in that darkest region, one does not get any refreshment,
but rather gradually becomes fatigued. He invents many processes to adjust
this fatigued condition, but he fails and thus remains confused. The only
path for mitigating his fatigue in the struggle for existence is the path of
devotional service, or the path of Krsna consciousness.

$7 Maitreya said: O best amongst the Kurus, the great sage Kapila,
moved by great compassion and pleased by the words of His glorious
mother, spoke as follows.
PURPORT
Lord Kapila was very satisfied by the request of His glorious mother
because she was thinking not only in terms of her personal salvation but in
terms of all the fallen conditioned souls. The Lord is always compassionate
towards the fallen souls of this material world, and therefore He comes
Himself or sends His confidential servants to deliver them. Since He is
perpetually compassionate towards them, if some of His devotees also be-
come compassionate towards them, He is very pleased with the devotees. In
Bhagavad-gita it is clearly stated that persons who are trying to elevate the
condition of the fallen souls by preaching the conclusion of Bhagavad-gita—
namely, full surrender unto the Personality of Godhead—are very dear
to Him. Thus when the Lord saw that His beloved mother was very compas-
sionate towards the fallen souls, He was pleased, and He also became
compassionate towards her.

TRANSLATION
Lord Kapila, the Personality of Godhead, replied: O noble lady, there
are multifarious paths of devotional service in terms of the different
qualities of the executor.
PURPORT
Pure devotional service in Krsna consciousness is one because in pure
devotional service there is no demand from the devotee to be fulfilled by
the Lord. But generally people take to devotional service with a purpose.
As stated in Bhagavad-gita, people who are not purified take to devotional
service with four purposes. A person who is distressed because of material
conditions becomes a devotee of the Lord and approaches the Lord for
mitigation of his distressed condition. A person in need of money ap-
proaches the Lord to ask for some improvement in his monetary condi-
tion. Others, who are not in distress or in need of monetary assistance
but are seeking knowledge in order to understand the Absolute Truth,
also take to devotional service, and they inquire into the nature of the
Supreme Lord. This is very nicely described in Bhagavad-gita (7.16).
Actually the path of devotional service is one without a second, but
according to the devotees’ condition, devotional service appears in
multifarious varieties, as will be nicely explained in the following verses.

Text 9] Explanation of Devotional Service 1235
TRANSLATION

Devotional service executed by a person who is envious, proud, violent
and angry, and who is a separatist, is considered to be in the mode of
darkness.

PURPORT

It has already been stated in the Srimad-Bhagavatam, First Canto,
Second Chapter, that the highest, most glorious religion is the attainment
of causeless, unmotivated devotional service. In pure devotional service,
the only motive should be to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
That is not actually a motive; that is the pure condition of the living entity.
In the conditioned stage, when one engages in devotional service, he should
follow the instruction of the bona fide spiritual master in full surrender.
The spiritual master is the manifested representation of the Supreme Lord
because he receives and presents the instructions of the Lord, as they are,
by disciplic succession. It is described in Bhagavad-gita that the teachings
therein should be received by disciplic succession, otherwise there is
adulteration. To act under the direction of a bona fide spiritual master
with a motive to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead is pure
devotional service. But if one has a motive for personal sense gratification,
his devotional service is manifested differently. Such a man may be
violent, proud, envious and angry, and his interests are separate from the
Lord’s.

One who approaches the Supreme Lord to render devotional service,
but who is proud of his personality, envious of others, or vengeful, is in the
mode of anger. He thinks that he is the best devotee. Devotional service
executed in this way is not pure; it is mixed and is of the lowest grade,
tamasah. Srila Vigvanatha Cakravarfi Thakura advises that a Vaisnava who is
not of good character should be avoided. A Vaisnava is one who has taken
the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the ultimate goal of life, but if
one is not pure and still has motives, then he is not a Vaisnava of the first
order of good character. One may offer his respects to such a Vaisnava
because he has accepted the Supreme Lord as the ultimate goal of life,
but one should not keep company with a Vaisnava who is in the mode of
ignorance.

TRANSLATION

The worship of Deities in the temple by a separatist, with a motive for
material enjoyment, fame and opulence, is devotion in the mode of
passion.

PURPORT

The word “separatist” must be understood carefully. The Sanskrit
words in this connection are bhinna-drk and prthag-bhavah. A separatist is
one who sees his interest as separate from that of the Supreme Lord. Mixed
devotees, or devotees in the modes of passion and ignorance, think that
the interest of the Supreme Lord is supplying the orders of the devotee;
the interest of such devotees is to draw from the Lord as much as possible
for their sense gratification. This is the separatist mentality. Actually, pure
devotion is explained in the previous chapter; the mind of the Supreme
Lord and the mind of the devotee should be dovetailed. A devotee should
not wish anything but to execute the desire of the Supreme. That is
oneness. When the devotee has an interest or will different from the
interest of the Supreme Lord, that is the separatist mentality. When the
so-called devotee desires material enjoyment, without reference to the
interest of the Supreme Lord, or he wants to become famous or opulent
by utilizing the mercy or grace of the Supreme Lord, he is in the mode of
passion.

Mayavadis, however, interpret this word “separatist” in a different way.
They say that while worshiping the Lord, one should think himself one
with the Supreme Lord. This is another adulterated form of devotion
within the modes of material nature. The conception that the living entity
is one with the Supreme is in the mode of ignorance. Oneness is actually
based on oneness of interest. A pure devotee has no interest but to act on
behalf of the Supreme Lord. When he has even a tinge of personal interest,
then his devotion is mixed with the three modes of material nature.

TRANSLATION

When a devotee worships the Supreme Personality of Godhead and
offers the results of his activities in order to free himself from the
inebrieties of fruitive activities, his devotion is in the mode of goodness.

PURPORT

The brahmanas, ksatriyas, vaisyas and siadras, along with the brahma-
caris, grhasthas, vanaprasthas and sannydasis, are the members of the eight
divisions of varnas and asramas, and they have their respective duties to
perform for the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When
such activities are performed and the results are offered to the Supreme
Lord, they are called karmarpapam, duties performed for the satisfaction
of the Lord. If there is any inebriety or fault, it is atoned for by this
offering process. But if this offering process is in the mode of goodness
rather than in pure devotion, then the interest is different. The four
dramas and the four varnas act for some benefit in accordance with their
personal interests. Therefore such activities are in the mode of goodness;
they cannot be counted in the category of pure devotion. Pure devotional
service as described by Riipa Gosvami is free from all material desires.
Anyabhilasita-sinyam. There can be no excuse for personal or material
interest. Devotional activities should be transcendental to fruitive activities
and empiric philosophical speculation. Pure devotional service is transcen-
dental to all material qualities.


--- Page 238 ---
1238 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 29
Devotional service in the modes of ignorance, passion and goodness can
be divided into eighty-one categories. There are different devotional
activities, such as hearing, chanting, remembering, worshiping, offering
prayer, rendering service and surrendering everything, and each of them
can be divided into three qualitative categories. There is hearing in the
mode of passion, in the mode of ignorance, and in the mode of goodness.
Similarly, there is chanting in the mode of ignorance, passion and good-
ness, etc. Three multiplied by nine equals twenty-seven, and when again
multiplied by three it becomes eighty-one. One has to transcend all such
mixed materialistic devotional service in order to reach the standard of pure
devotional service, as explained in the next verses.

Texts 11-12] Explanation of Devotional Service 1239
TRANSLATION

The manifestation of unadulterated devotional service is exhibited
when one’s mind is at once attracted to hearing the transcendental name
and quality of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is residing in
everyone’s heart. Just as the water of the Ganges flows naturally down
towards the ocean, such devotional ecstasy, uninterrupted by any material
condition, flows towards the Supreme Lord.

PURPORT

The basic principle of this unadulterated, pure devotional service is love
of Godhead. Mad-guna-sruti-mdtrena means “just after hearing about the
transcendental quality of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.” This
quality is called nirgupa. The Supreme Lord is uncontaminated by the
modes of material nature; therefore He is attractive to the pure devotee.
There is no need to practice meditation to attain such attraction; the pure
devotee is already in the transcendental stage, and the affinity between
him and the Supreme Personality of Godhead is natural and is compared
to the Ganges water flowing towards the sea. The flow of the Ganges
water cannot be stopped by any condition; similarly, a pure devotee’s
attraction for the transcendental name, form and pastimes of the Su-
preme Godhead cannot be stopped by any material condition. The word
avicchinnd, “without interruptions,” is very important in this connection.
No material condition can stop the flow of the devotional service of a
pure devotee.

The word ahaituki means “without reason.” A pure devotee does not
render loving service to the Personality of Godhead for any cause or for
any benefit, material or spiritual. This is the first symptom of unalloyed
devotion. Anyabhilasita-§iinyam: he has no desire to fulfill by rendering
devotional service. Such devotional service is meant for the purusottama,
the Supreme Personality, and not for anyone else. Sometimes pseudo-
devotees show devotion to many demigods, thinking the forms of the
demigods to be the same as the Supreme Personality of Godhead’s form.
It is specifically mentioned herein, however, that bhakti, devotional
service, is meant only for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana,
or Vignu or Krsna, not for anyone else.

Avyavahita means “without cessation.” A pure devotee must engage in
the service of the Lord twenty-four hours a day, without cessation; his life
is so molded that at every minute and every second he engages in some


--- Page 240 ---
1240 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 29
sort of devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Another
meaning of the word avyavahita is that the interest of the devotee and the
interest of the Supreme Lord are on the same level. The devotee has no
interest but to fulfill the transcendental desire of the Supreme Lord. Such
spontaneous service unto the Supreme Lord is transcendental and is never
contaminated by the material modes of nature. These are the symptoms of
pure devotional service, which is free from all contamination of material
nature.

TRANSLATION
A pure devotee does not accept any kind of liberation—salokya, sarsti,
samipya, sartipya or ekatva—even though they are offered by the
Supreme Personality of Godhead.
PURPORT
Lord Caitanya taught us how to execute pure devotional service out
of spontaneous love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the
Siksastaka, He prays to the Lord: “O Lord, I do not wish to gain from
You any wealth, nor do I wish to have a beautiful wife, nor do I wish to
have many followers. All I want from You is that in life after life I may
remain a pure devotee at Your lotus feet.” There is a similarity between
the prayers of Lord Caitanya and the statements of Srimad-Bhagavatam.
Lord Caitanya prays, “in life after life,” indicating that a devotee does not


--- Page 241 ---
Text 13] Explanation of Devotional Service 1241
even desire the cessation of birth and death. The yogis and empiric
philosophers desire cessation of the process of birth and death, but a
devotee is satisfied to remain even in this material world and execute
devotional service.

It is clearly staled herein that a pure devotee does not desire ekatva,
oneness with the Supreme Lord, as desired by the impersonalists, the
mental speculators and the meditators. To become one with the Supreme
Lord is beyond the dream of a pure devotee. Sometimes he may accept
promotion to the Vaikuntha planets to serve the Lord there, but he never
will accept merging into the Brahman effulgence, which he considers to be
worse than hellish. Such ekatva, or merging into the effulgence of the
Supreme Lord, is called kaivalya, but the happiness derived from kaivalya
is considered by the pure devotee to be hellish. The devotee is so fond of
rendering service to the Supreme Lord that the five kinds of liberation are
not important to him. If one is engaged in pure transcendental loving
service to the Lord, it is understood that he has already achieved the five
kinds of liberation.

When a devotee is promoted to the spiritual world, Vaikuntha, he
receives four kinds of facilities. One of these is salok ya, living on the same
planet as the Supreme Personality. The Supreme Person, in His different
plenary expansions, lives on innumerable Vaikuntha planets, and the chief
planet is Krsnaloka. Just as within the material universe the chief planet is
the sun, similarly in the spiritual world the chief planet is Krsnaloka.
From Krsnaloka, the bodily effulgence of Lord Krsna is distributed not
only to the spiritual world but to the material world as well; it is covered
by matter, however, in the material world. In the spiritual world there are
innumerable Vaikuntha planets, and on each one the Lord is the predom-
inating Deity. A devotee can be promoted to one such Vaikuntha planet
to live with the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

In sarsti liberation the opulence of the devotee is equal to the opulence
of the Supreme Lord. Samipya means to be a personal associate of the
Supreme Lord. In sariipya liberation the bodily features of the devotee
are exactly like those of the Supreme Person but for two or three symp-
toms which are found exclusively on the transcendental body of the
Lord. Srivatsa, for example, the hair on the chest of the Lord, particularly
distinguishes Him from His devotees.

A pure devotee does not accept these five kinds of spiritual existence,
even if they are offered, and he certainly does not hanker after material
benefits, which are all insignificant in comparison with spiritual benefits.
When Prahlada Maharaja was offered some material benefit, he stated:


--- Page 242 ---
1242 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 29
“My Lord, | have seen that my father achieved all kinds of material
benefits, and even the demigods were afraid of his opulence, but still, in a
second, You have finished his life and all his material prosperity.” For a
devotee there is no question of desiring any material or spiritual prosperity.
He simply aspires to serve the Lord. That is his highest happiness.

TRANSLATION

By attaining the highest platform of devotional service, as I have
explained, one can overcome the influence of the three modes of material
nature and be situated in the transcendental stage, as is the Lord.

PURPORT

Sripada Sarikaracarya, who is supposed to be the leader of the imperson-
alist school of philosophers, has admitted in the beginning of his comments
on Bhagavad-gita that Narayana, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is
beyond the material creation; except for Him, everything is within the
material creation. It is also confirmed in the Vedic literature that before
the creation there was only Narayana; neither Lord Brahma nor Lord Siva
existed. Only Narayana, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu,
or Krsna, is always in the transcendental position, beyond the influence of
material creation.

The material qualities of goodness, passion and ignorance cannot affect
the position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore He is
called nirguna (free from all tinges of material qualities). Here the same fact


--- Page 243 ---
Text 15] Explanation of Devotional Service 1243
is confirmed by Lord Kapila: one who is situated in pure devotional
service is transcendentally situated, as is the Lord. Just as the Lord is
unaffected by the influence of the material modes, so too are His pure
devotees. One who is not affected by the three modes of material nature
15 called a liberated soul, or brahma-bhiita soul. Brahma-bhiitah prasannatma
is the stage of liberation. 41072 brahmasmi: “1 am not this body.”
This is applicable only to the person who constantly engages in the
devotional service of Krsna and is thus in the transcendental stage; he is
above the influence of the three modes of material nature.

It is the misconception of the impersonalists that one can worship any
imaginary form of the Lord, or Brahman, and at the end merge in the
Brahman effulgence. Of course, to merge into the bodily effulgence
(Brahman) of the Supreme Lord is also liberation, as explained in the
previous verse. Ekatva is also liberation, but that sort of liberation is
never accepted by any devotee because qualitative oneness is immediately
attained as soon as one is situated in devotional service. For a devotee,
that qualitative equality, which is the result of impersonal liberation, is
already attained; he does not have to try for it separately. It is clearly
stated here that simply by pure devotional service one becomes qualita-
tively as good as the Lord Himself.

--- Page 244 ---
1244 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 29
PURPORT

One has to execute his prescribed duties according to his social position
as a brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya or Sitdra. The prescribed duties of the four
classes of men in human society are also described in Bhagavad-gita. The
activities of brdhmanas are to control the senses and to become simple,
clean, learned devotees. The ksatriyas have the spirit for ruling, they are
not afraid on the battlefield, and they are charitable. The vaisyas, or the
mercantile class of men, trade in commodities, protect cows and develop
agricultural produce. The sidras, or laborer class, serve the higher classes
because they themselves are not very intelligent.

From every position, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gila, sva-karmapa
tam abhyarcya: one can serve the Supreme Lord by performing his pre
scribed duty. Itis not that only the bréhmanas can serve the Supreme Lord
and not the sitdras. Anyone can serve the Supreme Lord by performing his
prescribed duties under the direction of a spiritual master or representative
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. No one should think that his
prescribed duties are inferior. A brahmana can serve the Lord by using his
intelligence, and the ksatriya can serve the Supreme Lord by using his
military arts, just as Arjuna served Krsna. Arjuna was a warrior; he had no
time to study Vedanta, or other highly intellectual books. The damsels in
Vrajadhama were girls born of the vaiSya class, and they engaged in
protecting cows and producing agriculture. Krsna’s foster father, Nanda
Maharaja, and his associates were all vaisyas. They were not at all educated,
but they could serve Krsna by loving Him and by offering everything to
Him. Similarly, there are many instances in which candalas, or those
lower than siidras, have served Krsna. Also, the sage Vidura was considered
a Sidra because his mother happened to be siidra. There are no distinctions,
for it is declared by the Lord in Bhagavad-gita that anyone engaged
specifically in devotional service is elevated to the transcendental position
without a doubt. Everyone's prescribed duty is glorious if it is performed
in devotional service of the Lord, without desire for profit. Such loving
service must be performed without reason, without impediment and
spontaneously. Krsna is lovable, and one has to serve Him in whatever
capacity he can. That is pure devotional service.

Another significant phrase in this verse is ndtihinisrena (with minimum
violence or sacrifice of life). Even if a devotee has to commit violence, it
should not be done beyond what is necessary. Sometimes the question is
put before us: “You ask us not to eat meat, but you are eating vegetables.
Do you think that is not violence?” The answer is that eating vegetables is
violence and vegetarians are also committing violence against other living


--- Page 245 ---
Text 16] Explanation of Devotional Service 1245
entities because vegetables also have life. Nondevotees are killing cows,
goats and so many other animals for eating purposes, and a devotee who is
vegetarian is also killing. But here, significantly, it is stated that every living
entity has to live by killing another entity; that is the law of nature. Jivo
Jjivasya jivanam: one living entity is the life for another living entity. But
for a human being, that violence should be committed only as much as
necessary.

A human being is not to eat anything which is not offered to the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Yajia-sistasinah santah: one becomes
freed from all sinful reactions by eating foodstuffs which are offered to
Yajiia, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A devotee therefore eats only
prasada, or foodstuffs offered to the Supreme Lord, and Krsna says that
when a devotee offers Him foodstuffs from the vegetable kingdom, with
devotion, He eats that. A devotee is to offer to Krsna foodstuffs prepared
from vegetables. If the Supreme Lord wanted foodstuffs prepared from
animal food, the devotee could offer this, but He does not order to do
that.

We have to commit violence; that is a natural law. We should not,
however, commit violence extravagantly, but only as much as ordered by the
Lord. Arjuna engaged in the art of killing, and although killing is, of course,
violence, he killed the enemy simply on Krsna’s order. In the same way, if
we commit violence as it is necessary, by the order of the Lord, that is
called ndtihirnsa. We cannot avoid violence because we are put into a
conditional life in which we have to commit violence, but we should not
commit more violence than necessary or than ordered by the Supreme
Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION

The devotee should regularly see My statues in the temple, touch My
lotus feet and offer worshipable paraphernalia and prayer. He should see
in the spirit of renunciation, from the mode of goodness, and see every
living entity as spiritual.

PURPORT

Temple worship is one of the duties of a devotee. It is especially recom-
mended for neophytes, but those who are advanced should not refrain
from temple worship. There is a distinction in the manner a neophyte and
an advanced devotee appreciate the Lord’s presence in the temple. A
neophyte considers the arca-vigraha (the statue of the Lord) to be different
from the original Personality of Godhead; he considers it a representation
of the Supreme Lord in the form of a Deity. But an advanced devotee
accepts the Deity in the temple as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
He does not sce any difference between the original form of the Lord and
the statue, or arca form of the Lord, in the temple. This is the vision of a
devotee whose devotional service is in the highest stage of bhava, or love of
Godhead, whereas a neophyte’s worship in the temple is a matter of routine
duty.

Temple Deity worship is one of the functions of a devotee. He goes
regularly to see the Deity nicely decorated, and with veneration and re-
spect he touches the lotus feet of the Lord and presents offerings of
worship, such as fruits, flowers and prayers. At the same time, to advance
in devotional service, a devotee should see other living entities as spiritual
sparks, parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord. A devotee is to offer
respect to every entity that has a relationship with the Lord. Because every
living entity originally has a relationship with the Lord as part and parcel,
a devotee should try to see all living entities on the same equal level of
spiritual existence. As stated in Bhagavad-gita, a pandita, one who is learned,
sees equally a very learned brahmana, a $udra, a hog, a dog and a cow. He
does not see the body, which is only an outward dress. lle does not
see the dress of a brahmana, or that of a cow or of a hog. He sees
the spiritual spark, part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. If a devotee does
not see every living entity as part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, he is
considered prakrta-bhakta, a materialistic devotee. He is not completely
situated on the spiritual platform; rather, he is in the lowest stage of
devotion. He does, however, show all respect to the Deity.

Although a devotee sees all living entities on the level of spiritual
existence, he is not interested in associating with everyone. Simply because


--- Page 247 ---
Text 17] Explanation of Devotional Service 1247
a tiger is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord does not mean that we
embrace him because of his spiritual relationship with the Supreme Lord.
We must associate only with persons who have developed Krsna conscious-
ness.

We should befriend and offer special respect to persons who are
developed in Krsna consciousness. Other living entities are undoubtedly
part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, but because their consciousness is
still covered and not developed in Krsna consciousness, we should renounce
their association. It is said by Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura that even if
one is a Vaisnava, if he is not of good character, his company should be
avoided, although he may be offered the respect of a Vaisnava. Anyone
who accepts Vignu as the Supreme Personality of Godhead is accepted
as a Vaisnava, but a Vaignava is expected to develop all the good qualities
of the demigods.

The exact meaning of the word sattvena is given by Sridhara Svami as
being synonymous with dhairyena, or patience. One must perform devo-
tional service with great patience. One should not give up the execution of
devotional service because one or two attempts have not been successful.
One must continue. इम 008 Gosvami also confirms that one should be
very enthusiastic and execute devotional service with patience and confi-
dence. Patience is necessary for developing the confidence that ‘Krsna will
certainly accept me because 1 am engaging in devotional service.” One has
only to execute service according to the rules and regulations to insure
success.

TRANSLATION

The pure devotee should execute devotional service by giving the
greatest respect to the spiritual master and the acaryas. He should be
compassionate to the poor and make friendship with persons who are his
equals, but all his activities should be executed under regulation and with
control of the senses.

PURPORT

In Bhagavad-gita, Thirteenth Chapter, it is clearly stated that one should
execute devotional service and advance on the path of spiritual knowledge
by accepting the acarya. Acaryopasanam: one should worship an acarya,
a spiritual master who knows things as they are. The spiritual master must
be in the disciplic succession from Krsna. The predecessors of the spiritual
master are his spiritual master, his grand spiritual master, his great grand
spiritual master and so on, who form the disciplic succession of acaryas.

It is recommended herewith that all the acaryas be given the highest
respect. lt is stated, gurusu nara-matih. Gurusu means “unto the 2027 05”
and nara-matih means ‘thinking like a common man.” To think of the
Vaignavas, the devotees, as belonging to a particular caste or community,
to think of the acaryas as ordinary men, or to think of the Deity in the
temple as being made of stone, wood or metal, is condemned. Niyamena:
one should offer the greatest respect to the acaryas according to the stan-
dard regulations. A devotee should also be compassionate to the poor.
This does not refer to those who are poverty-stricken materially. Accord-
ing to devotional vision, a man is poor if he is not in Krsna consciousness.
A man may be very rich materially, but if he is not Krsna conscious, he is
considered poor. On the other hand, many dcaryas, such as Ripa Gosvami
and Sanatana Gosvami, used to live beneath trees every night. Super-
ficially it appeared that they were very poverty-stricken, but from their
writings we can understand that in spiritual life they were the richest
personalities.

A devotee shows compassion to those poor souls who are wanting in
spiritual knowledge by enlightening them in order to elevate them to
Krsna consciousness. That is one of the duties of a devotee. He should also
make friendship with persons who are on an equal level with himself or
who have the same understanding that he does. For a devotee, there is no
point in making friendships with ordinary persons; he should make friend-
ship with other devotees so that by discussing among themselves, they


--- Page 249 ---
Text 18] Explanation of Devotional Service 1249
may elevate one another on the path of spiritual understanding. This is
called ista-gosthi.

In Bhagavad-gita there is reference to bodhayantah parasparam,
“discussing among themselves.” Generally pure devotees utilize their
valuable time in chanting and discussing various activities of Lord Krsna
or Lord Caitanya amongst themselves. There are innumerable books, such
as the Puranas, Mahabharata, Bhagavatam, Bhagavad-gita and Upanisads,
which contain countless subjects for discussion among two devotees or
more. Friendship should be cemented between persons with mutual in-
terests and understanding. Such persons are said to be sva-jati, “of the
same caste.” The devotee should avoid a person whose character is not
fixed in the standard understanding; even though he may be a Vaisnava or
a devotee of Krsna, if his character is not correctly representative, then
he should be avoided. One should steadily control the senses and the mind
and strictly follow the rules and regulations, and he should make friend-
ship with persons of the same standard.

who are not spiritually advanced.


--- Page 250 ---
1250 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 29
PURPORT

In order to advance in spiritual understanding, one has to hear from
authentic sources about spiritual knowledge. One can understand the
reality of spiritual life by following strict regulative principles and by
controlling the senses. To have control it is necessary that one be non-
violent and truthful, refrain from stealing, abstain from sex life and possess
only that which is absolutely necessary for keeping the body and soul
together. One should not eat more than necessary, he should not collect
more paraphernalia than necessary, he should not talk unnecessarily with
common men, and he should not follow the rules and regulations without
purpose. He should follow the rules and regulations so that he may actually
make advancement.

There are eighteen qualifications mentioned in Bhagavad-gitd, among
which is simplicity. One should be without pride; one should not demand
unnecessary respect from others, and one should be nonviolent. Amanitvam
adambhitvam ahirisa. One should be very tolerant and simple, one should
accept the spiritual master, and one should control the senses. These are
mentioned here and in Bhagavad-gita as well. One should hear from
authentic sources how to advance in spiritual life; such instructions should
be taken from the acarya and should be assimilated.

It is especially mentioned here, nama-sankirtanac ca: one should chant
the holy names of the Lord, Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare
Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, either individually
or with others. Lord Caitanya has given special stress to chanting of these
holy names of the Lord as the basic principle of spiritual advancement.
Another word used here is arjavena, meaning “‘without diplomacy.” A
devotee should not make plans out of self-interest. Of course preachers
sometimes have to make some plan to execute the mission of the Lord
under proper guidance, but regarding personal self-interest, a devotee
should always be without diplomacy, and he should avoid the company of
persons who are not advancing in spiritual life. Another word is arya.
Aryans are persons who are advancing in knowledge of Krsna consciousness
as well as in material prosperity. The difference between the Aryan and
non-Aryan, the sura and asura, is in their standards of spiritual advance-
ment. Association with persons who are not spiritually advanced is for-
bidden. Lord Caitanya advised, asat-sainga-tyaga. One should avoid persons
who are attached to the temporary. Asat is one who is too materially
attached, who is not a devotee of the Lord and who is too attached to
women or enjoyable material things. Such a person, according to
Vaignava philosophy, is a persona non grata.


--- Page 251 ---
Text 19] Explanation of Devotional Service 1251

A devotee should not be proud of his acquisitions. The symptoms of a
devotee are meekness and humility. Although very spiritually advanced,
he will always remain meek and humble, as Kaviragja Gosvami and all the
other Vaisnavas have taught us by personal example. Caitanya Mahaprabhu
taught that one should be humbler than the grass on the street and more
tolerant than the tree. One should not be proud or falsely puffed up. In
this way one will surely advance in spiritual life.

TRANSLATION

When one is fully qualified with all these transcendental attributes and
his consciousness is thus completely purified, he is immediately attracted
simply by hearing My name or hearing of My transcendental quality.

PURPORT

In the beginning of this instruction, the Lord explained to His mother
that mad-guna-sruti-matrepa, simply by hearing the name, quality, form,
etc., of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one is immediately attracted.
A person becomes fully qualified with all transcendental qualities by fol-
lowing the rules and regulations, as recommended in different scriptures.
We have developed certain unnecessary qualities by material association,
and by following the above process we become free from that contamina-
tion. To develop transcendental qualities, as explained in the previous
verse, one must become free from these contaminated qualities.

TRANSLATION
As the chariot of air carries an aroma from its source and immediately
catches the sense of smell, similarly, one who constantly engages in
devotional service, in Krsna consciousness, can catch the Supreme Soul,
who is equally present everywhere.
PURPORT
As a breeze carrying a pleasant fragrance from a garden of flowers at
once captures the organ of smell, so one’s consciousness, saturated with
devotion, can at once capture the transcendental existence of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, who, in His Paramatma feature, is present every-
where, even in the heart of every living being. It is stated in Bhagavad-gita
that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is ksetra-jiia, present within this
body, but He is also simultaneously present in every other body. Since the
individual soul is present only in a particular body, he is altered when
another individual soul does not cooperate with him. The Supersoul, how-
ever, is equally present everywhere. Individual souls may disagree, but the
Supersoul, being equally present in every body, is called unchanging, or
avikari. The individual soul, when fully saturated with Krsna consciousness,
can understand the presence of the Supersoul. It is confirmed in Bhagavad-
gita that (bhaktya mam abhijanati) a person saturated with devotional
service in full Krsna consciousness can understand the Supreme Personality
of Godhead either as Supersoul or as the Supreme Person.

I am present in every living entity as the Supersoul. If someone neglects

PURPORT
In purified consciousness, or Krsna consciousness, one sees the presence
of Krsna everywhere. If, therefore, one only engages in Deity worship in
the temple and does not consider other living entities, then he is in the
lowest grade of devotional service. One who worships the Deity in the
temple and does not show respect to others is a devotee on the material
platform, in the lowest stage of devotional service. A devotee should try to
understand everything in relationship with Krsna and try to serve every-
thing in that spirit. To serve everything means to engage cverything in the
service of Krsna. If a person is innocent and does not know his relationship
with Krsna, an advanced devotee should try to engage him in the service of
Krsna. One who is advanced in Krsna consciousness can engage not only
the living being but everything in the service of Krsna.

TRANSLATION

One who worships the Deity of Godhead in the temples but does not
know that the Supreme Lord, as Paramatma, is situated in every living
entity’s heart, must be in ignorance and is compared to one who offers
oblations into ashes.

PURPORT

It is stated clearly herein that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in
His plenary expansion of Supersoul, is present in all living entities. The
living entities have 8,400,000 different kinds of bodies, and the Supreme
Personality of Godhead is living in every body both as the individual soul
and as the Supersoul. Since the individual soul is part and parcel of the
Supreme Lord, in that sense the Lord is living in every body, and, as
Supersoul, the Lord is also present as a witness. In both cases the presence
of God in every living entity is essential. Therefore persons who profess to
belong to some religious sect but who do not feel the presence of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead in every living entity, and everywhere
else, are in the mode of ignorance.

If, without this preliminary knowledge of the Lord’s omnipresence
everywhere, one simply attaches himself to the rituals in a temple, church
or mosque, it is as if he were offering butter into ashes rather than into the
fire. One offers sacrifices by pouring clarified butter into a fire and chant-
ing Vedic mantras, but even if there are Vedic mantras and all conditions
are favorable, if the clarified butter is poured on ashes, then such a sacrifice
will be useless. In other words, a devotee should not ignore any living
entity. The devotee must know that in every living entity, however insig-
nificant he may be, even in an ant, God is present, and therefore every
living entity should be kindly treated and should not be subjected to any
violence. In modern civilized society, slaughterhouses are regularly main-
tained and supported by a certain type of religious principle. But without


--- Page 255 ---
Text 23] Explanation of Devotional Service 1255
knowledge of the presence of God in every living entity, any so-called
advancement of human civilization, either spiritual or material, is to be
understood as being in the mode of ignorance.

In this verse, two phrases, bhittesu baddha-vairasya (‘‘inimical towards
others”) and dvisatah para-kdye (“envious of another’s body’), are
significant. One who is envious of or inimical towards others never exper-
iences any happiness. A devotee’s vision, therefore, must be perfect. He
should ignore bodily distinctions and should see only the presence of the
part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, and the Lord Himself in His plenary
expansion as Supersoul. That is the vision of a pure devotee. The bodily
expression of a particular type of living entity is always ignored by the
devotee.

It is expressed herein that the Lord is always eager to deliver the condi-
tioned souls, who have been encaged within material bodies. Devotees are
expected to carry the message or desire of the Lord to such conditioned
souls and enlighten them with Krsna consciousness. Thus they may be
elevated to transcendental, spiritual life, and the mission of their lives will


--- Page 256 ---
1256 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 29
be successful. Of course this is not possible for living entities who are lower
than human beings, but in human society it is feasible that all living entities
can be enlightened with Krsna consciousness. Even living entities who are
lower than human can be raised to Krsna consciousness by other methods.
For example, Sivananda Sena, a great devotee of Lord Caitanya, delivered
a dog by feeding him prasada. Bistribution of prasada, or remnants of
foodstuffs offered to the Lord, even to the ignorant masses of people
and to animals, gives such living entities the chance for elevation to Krsna
consciousness. Factually it happened that the same dog, when met by Lord
Caitanya at Purl, was liberated from the material condition.

It is especially mentioned here that a devotee must be free from all
violence (08861887156). Lord Caitanya has recommended that a devotee not
commit violence to any living entity. Sometimes the question is raised
that since vegetables also have life and devotees take vegetable foodstuffs,
isn’t that violence? Firstly, however, taking some leaves, twigs or fruit
from a tree or plant does not Kill the plant. Besides that, jivahimsa means
that since every living entity has to pass through a particular type of body
according to his past karma, although every living entity is eternal, he
should not be disturbed in his gradual evolution. A devotee has to execute
the principles of devotional service exactly as they are, and he must know
that however insignificant a living entity may be, the Lord is present within
him. A devotee must realize this universal presence of the Lord.

Text 24] Explanation of Devotional Service 1257
TRANSLATION

My dear Mother, even if he worships with proper rituals and
paraphernalia, a person who is ignorant of My presence in all living
entities never pleases Me by the worship of My Deities in the temple.

PURPORT

There are sixty-four different prescriptions for worship of the Deity in
the temple. There are many items offered to the Deity, some valuable and
some less valuable. 1t is prescribed in Bhagavad-gita: “If a devotee offers
Me a small flower, a leaf, some water, or a little fruit, I will accept it.”
The real purpose is to exhibit one’s loving devotion to the Lord; the offer-
ings themselves are secondary. If one has not developed loving devotion
to the Lord and simply offers many kinds of foodstuffs, fruits and flowers
without real devotion, the offering will not be accepted by the Lord. We
cannot bribe the Personality of Godhead. He is so great that our bribery
has no value. Nor has He any scarcity; since He is full in Himself, what can
we offer Him? Everything is produced by Him. We simply offer to show
our love and gratitude to the Lord.

This gratitude and love for God is exhibited by a pure devotee who
knows that the Lord lives in every living entity. As such, temple worship
necessarily includes distribution of prasada. It is not that one should
create a temple in his private apartment or private room, offer something
to the Lord, and then eat. Of course, that is better than simply cooking
foodstuffs and eating without understanding one’s relationship with the
Supreme Lord; people who act in this manner are just like animals. But
the devotee who wants to elevate himself to the higher level of under-
standing must know that the Lord is present in every living entity, and, as
stated in the previous verse, one should be compassionate to other living
entities. A devotee should worship the Supreme Lord, be friendly to
persons who are on the same level, and be compassionate to the ignorant.
One should exhibit his compassion for ignorant living entities by dis-
tributing prasada. Distribution of prasada to the ignorant masses of
people is essential for persons who make offerings to the Personality of
Godhead.

Real love and devotion is accepted by the Lord. Many valuable
foodstuffs may be presented to a person, but if the person is not hungry,
all such offerings are useless for him. Similarly, we may offer many valuable
items to the Deity, but if we have no real sense of devotion and no real


--- Page 258 ---
1258 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 29
sense of the Lord’s presence everywhere, then we are lacking in devotional
service; in such a state of ignorance, we cannot offer anything acceptable
to the Lord.

TRANSLATION
Performing his prescribed duties, one should worship the Deity of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead until he realizes My presence in his own
heart and in the hearts of other living entities as well.
PURPORT
Worship of the Deity of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is
prescribed herewith even for persons who are simply discharging their
prescribed duties. There are prescribed duties for the different classes of
men—the brahmanas, the vaisyas, the ksatriyas and the siidras—and for the
different asramas—brahmacarya, grhastha, vanaprastha and sannyasa. One
should worship the Deity of the Lord until one appreciates the presence of
the Lord in every living entity. In other words, one should not be satisfied
simply by discharging his duties properly; he must realize his relationship
and the relationship of all other living entities with the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. If he does not understand this, then even though he discharges
his prescribed duties properly, it is to be understood that he is simply
laboring without profit.
The word sva-karma-krt in this verse is very significant. Sva-karma-krt
is one who engages in discharging his prescribed duties. It is not that one


--- Page 259 ---
Text 27] Explanation of Devotional Service 1259
who has become a devotee of the Lord or who engages in devotional
service should give up his prescribed duties. No one should be lazy under
the plea of devotional service. One has to execute devotional service
according to his prescribed duties. Sva-karma-krt means that one should
discharge the duties prescribed for him without neglect.

PURPORT
There are bodily differentiations among all varieties of living entities,
but a devotee should not distinguish between one living entity and another
on such a basis; a devotee’s outlook should be that both the soul and
Supersoul are equally present in all varieties of living entities.

TRANSLATION

Therefore, through charitable gifts and attention, as well as through
friendly behavior and by viewing all to be alike, one should propitiate Me,
who abide in all creatures as their very Self.

PURPORT

It should not be misunderstood that because the Supersoul is dwelling
within the heart of a living entity, the individual soul has become equal to
Him. The equality of the Supersoul and the individual soul is misconceived
by the impersonalist. Here it is distinctly mentioned that the individual
soul should be recognized in relationship with the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. The method of worshiping the individual soul is described here
as either giving charitable gifts or behaving in a friendly manner, free from
any separatist outlook. The impersonalist sometimes accepts a poor
individual soul as being daridra-narayanpa, meaning that Narayapa, the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, has become poor. This is a contradiction.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is full in all opulences. He can agree
to live with a poor soul or even with an animal, but this does not make Him
poor.

There are two Sanskrit words used here, seva and daya. Seva indicates a
superior, and ddya indicates one who gives charitable gifts or is compas-
sionate towards an inferior. We cannot treat the Supreme Personality of
Godhead as an inferior who is dependent on our charitable gifts. When we
give charity, it is to a person who is inferior in his material or economic
condition. Charity is not given to a rich man. Similarly, it is explicitly
stated here that mana, respect, is offered to a superior, and charity is
offered to an inferior. The living entities, according to different results of
fruitive activities, may become rich or poor, but the Supreme Personality
of Godhead is unchangeable; He is always full in six opulences. Treating
a living entity equally does not mean treating him as one would treat the


--- Page 261 ---
Text 28] Explanation of Devotional Service 1261
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Compassion and friendliness do not
necessitate falsely elevating someone to the exalted position of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. We should not, at the same time,
misunderstand that the Supersoul situated in the heart of an animal like a
hog and the Supersoul situated in the heart of a learned brahmana are
different. The Supersoul in all living entities is the same Supreme
Personality of Godhead. By His omnipotency, He can live anywhere, and
He can create His Vaikuntha situation everywhere. That is His inconceiv-
able potency. Therefore, when Narayana is living in the heart of a hog, He
does not become a hog-Narayana. He is always Narayana and is unaffected
by the body of the hog.

TRANSLATION

Living entities are superior to inanimate objects, O blessed mother, and
among them, living entities who display life symptoms are better. Animals
with developed consciousness are better than them, and better still are
those who have developed sense perception.

PURPORT

In the previous verse it was explained that living entities should be
honored by charitable gifts and friendly behavior, and in this verse and in
the following verses, the description of different grades of living entities is


--- Page 262 ---
1262 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 29
given so that one can know when to behave friendly and when to give
charity. For example, a tiger is a living entity, part and parcel of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the Supreme Lord is living in the
heart of the tiger as Supersoul. But does this mean that we have to treat
the tiger in a friendly manner? Certainly not. We have to treat him
differently, giving him charity in the form of prasada. The many saintly
persons in the jungles do not treat the tigers in a friendly way, but they
supply prasada foodstuffs to them. The tigers come, take the food and go
away, just asa dog does. According to the Vedic system, a dog 15 not allowed
to enter the house. Because of their uncleanliness, cats and dogs are not
allowed within the apartment of a gentleman, but they are so trained that
they stand outside. The compassionate householder will supply prasada
to the dogs and cats, who eat outside and then go away. We must treat the
lower living entities compassionately, but this does not mean that we
have to treat them in the same way we treat other human beings. The
feeling of equality must be there, but the treatment should be discrimi-
nating. Just how discrimination should be maintained is given in the
following six verses concerning the different grades of living conditions.

The first division is made between dead, stonelike matter and the living
organism. A living organism is sometimes manifested even in stone.
Experience shows that some hills and mountains grow. This is due to the
presence of the soul within that stone. Above that, the next manifestation
of the living condition is development of consciousness, and the next
manifestation is the development of sense perception. In the Moksa-
dharma section of the Mahabharata it is stated that trees have developed
sense perception; they can see and smell. We know by experience that
trees can see. Sometimes in its growth a large tree changes its course of
development to avoid some hindrances. This means that a tree can see, and
according to Mahabhdrata, a tree can also smell. This indicates the
development of sense perception.

TRANSLATION

Among the living entities who have developed sense perception, those
who have developed the sense of taste are better than those who have
developed only the sense of touch. Better than them are those who have
developed the sense of smell, and better still are those who have developed
the sense of hearing.

PURPORT

Although Westerners accept that Darwin first expounded the doctrine of
evolution, the science of anthropology is not new. The development of the
evolutionary process was known long before from the Bhagavatam, which
was written 5,000 years ago. There are records of the statements of
Kapila Muni, who was present almost in the beginning of the creation.
This knowledge has existed since the Vedic time, and all these sequences
are disclosed in Vedic literature; the theory of gradual evolution or
anthropology is not new to the Vedas.

It is said here that amongst the trees there are also evolutionary
processes; the different kinds of trees have touch perception. It is said that
better than the trees are the fish because fish have developed the sense of
taste. Better than the fish are the bees, who have developed the sense of
smell, and better than them are the serpents because serpents have
developed the sense of hearing. In the darkness of night a snake can find
its eatables simply by hearing the frog’s very pleasant cry. The snake can
understand, “There is the frog,” and he captures the frog simply because
of its sound vibration. This example is sometimes given for persons who
vibrate sounds simply for death. One may have a very nice tongue that can
vibrate sound like the frogs, but that kind of vibration is simply calling
death. The best use of the tongue and of sound vibration is to chant
Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama,
Rama Rama, Hare Hare. That will protect one from the hands of cruel
death.

are the human beings.

It is said that certain birds, such as crows, can distinguish one form from
another. Living entities that have many legs, like the wasp, are better than
plants and grasses, which have no legs. Four-legged animals are better
than many-legged living entities, and better than the animals is the human
being, who has only two legs.

TRANSLATION

Among human beings, the society which is divided according to quality
and work is best, and in that society, the intelligent men, who are
designated as brahmanas, are best. Among the brahmanas, one who has
studied the Vedas is the best, and among the brahmanas who have studied
the Vedas, one who knows the actual purport of Veda is the best.

PURPORT

The system of four classifications in human society according to quality
and work 15 very scientific. This system of brahmanas, ksatriyas, vaisyas,
and $00705 has now become vitiated as the present caste system in India,
but it appears that this system has been current a very long time, since it is
mentioned in Srimad-Bhagavatam and Bhagavad-gita. Unless there is such
a division of the social orders in human society, including the intelligent
class, the martial class, the mercantile class and the laborer class, then there
is always confusion as to who is to work for what purpose. A person
trained to the stage of understanding the Absolute Truth is a brahmana,
and when such a brahmana is veda-jiia, then he understands the purpose of
Veda. The purpose of Veda is to understand the Absolute. One who
understands the Absolute Truth in three phases, namely Brahman,
Paramatma and Bhagavan, and who understands the term Bhagavan to
mean the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is considered to be the best
of the brahmanas, or a ४ 315118५३.

TRANSLATION

Better than the brahmana who knows the purpose of the Vedas is he
who can dissipate all doubts, and better than him is one who strictly
follows the brahminical principles. Better than him is one who is liberated
from all material contamination, and better than him is a pure devotee
who executes devotional service without expectation of reward.

PURPORT

Arthajiia-brahmana refers to one who has made a thorough analytical
study of the Absolute Truth and who knows that the Absolute Truth is
realized in three different phases, namely Brahman, Paramatma and
Bhagavan. If someone not only has this knowledge but is able to clear all
doubts if questioned about the Absolute Truth, he is considered better.
Further, there may be a learned brahmana Vaisnava who can explain clearly
and eradicate all doubts, but if he does not follow the Vaisnava principles,
then he is not situated on a higher level. One must be able to clear all
doubts and simultaneously be situated in the brahminical characteristics.
Such a person, who knows the purpose of the Vedic injunctions, who can
employ the principles laid down in the Vedic literatures and who teaches his
disciples in that way, is called an acarya. The position of an acarya is that
he executes devotional service with no desire for elevation to a higher
position of life.

The highest perfectional brahmana is the Vaisnava. A Vaisnava who
knows the science of the Absolute Truth but is not able to preach such
knowledge to others is described as being in the lower stage, one who not
only understands the principles of the science of God but can also preach
is in the second stage, and one who not only can preach but who also sees
everything in the Absolute Truth and the Absolute Truth in everything 18
in the highest class of Vaignavas. It is mentioned here that a Vaisnava is
already a brahmana; in fact, the highest stage of brahminical perfection is
reached when one becomes a Vaignava.

TRANSLATION

Therefore I do not find a greater person than he who has no interest
outside of Mine and who therefore engages and dedicates all his activities
and all his life—everything—unto Me without cessation.

PURPORT

In this verse the word sama-darsanat means that he no longer has any
separate interest; the devotee’s interest and the Supreme Personality of
Godhead’s interest are one. For example, Lord Caitanya, in the role of a
devotee, also preached the same philosophy. He preached that Krsna is the
worshipful Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and that the
interest of His pure devotees is the same as His own.

Sometimes Mayavadi philosophers, due to a poor fund of knowledge,
define the word sama-darsanat to mean that a devotee should see himself as
one with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is foolishness. When
one thinks himself one with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there is
no question of serving Him. When there is service, there must be a master.
Three things must be present for there to be service: the master, the servant
and the service. Here it is clearly stated that he who has dedicated his life,
all his activities, his mind and his soul—everything—for the satisfaction of
the Supreme Lord, is considered to be the greatest person.

The word akartuh means “without any sense of proprietorship.” Every-
one wants to act as the proprietor of his actions so that he can enjoy the
result. A devotee, however, has no such desire; he acts because the Person-
ality of Godhead wants him to act in a particular way. He has no personal
motive. When Lord Caitanya preached Krsna consciousness, it was not


--- Page 268 ---
1268 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 29
with the purpose that people would call Him Krsna, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead; rather, He preached that Krsna is the Supreme
Personality of Godhead and should be worshiped as such. A devotee who
is a most confidential servant of the Lord never does anything for his per-
sonal account, but does everything for the satisfaction of the Supreme
Lord. It is clearly stated, therefore, mayi sannyasta-karmanah. The devotee
works, but he works for the Supreme. It is also stated, mayy arpititmanah:
“He gives his mind unto Me.” These are the qualifications of a devotee,
who, according to this verse, is accepted as the highest of all human
beings.

TRANSLATION
Such a perfect devotee offers respects to every living entity because he
is under the firm conviction that the Supreme Personality of Godhead
has entered the body of every living entity as the Supersoul, or controller.
PURPORT
A perfect devotee, as described above, does not make the mistake of
thinking that because the Supreme Personality of Godhead as Paramatma
has entered into the body of every living entity, therefore every living
entity has become the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is foolish-
ness. Suppose a person enters into a room; that does not mean that the
room has become that person. Similarly, that the Supreme Lord has
entered into each of the 8,400,000 particular types of material bodies
does not mean that each of these bodies has become the Supreme Lord.


--- Page 269 ---
Text 35] Explanation of Devotional Service 1269
Because the Supreme Lord is present, however, a pure devotee accepts
each body as the temple of the Lord, and since the devotee offers
respect to such temples in full knowledge, he gives respect to every
living entity in relationship with the Lord. Mayavadi philosophers wrongly
think that because the Supreme Person has entered the body of a poor
man, the Supreme Lord has therefore become daridra-nariayana, or poor
Narayana. These are all blasphemous statements of atheists and non-
devotees.

satisfied simply by practicing the sitting postures and thinking himself
complete. By meditation one must attain to the stage of devotional
service. As previously described, a yogi is advised to meditate on the form
of Lord Visnu, from point to point, from the ankles, to the legs, to the
knees, to the thighs, to the chest, to the neck, and in this way gradually


--- Page 270 ---
1270 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 29
up to the face and then to the ornaments. There is no question of
impersonal meditation.

When, by meditation on the Supreme Personality of Godhead in all
detail, one comes to the point of love of God, that is the point of bhakti-
yoga, and at that point he must actually render service to the Lord out of
transcendental love. Anyone who practices yoga and comes to the point
of devotional service can attain the Supreme Personality of Godhead in
His transcendental abode. Here it is clearly stated, purusah purusari
vrajet: The purusa, the living entity, goes to the Supreme Person. The
Supreme Personality of Godhead and the living entity are qualitatively
one; both are defined as purusa. The quality of purusa exists both in the
Supreme Godhead and in the living entity. Purusa means enjoyer, and the
spirit of enjoyment is present both in the living entity and in the Supreme
Lord. The difference is that the quantity of enjoyment is not equal. The
living entity cannot experience the same quantity of enjoyment as the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. An analogy may be made with a rich
man and a poor man: The propensity for enjoyment is present in both,
but the poor man cannot enjoy in the same quantity as the rich man.
When the poor man dovetails his desires with those of the rich man,
however, and when there is cooperation between the poor man and the
rich man, or between the big and the small man, then the enjoyment is
shared equally. That is like bhakti-yoga. Purusah purusari vrajet: When the
living entity enters into the kingdom of God and cooperates with the
Supreme Lord by giving Him enjoyment, he enjoys the same facility or
the same amount of pleasure as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

On the other hand, when the living entity wants to enjoy by imitating
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, that is called maya, and it puts
him in the material atmosphere. A living entity who wants to enjoy on
his personal account and not cooperate with the Supreme Lord is engaged
in materialistic life. As soon as he dovetails his enjoyment with the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is engaged in spiritual life. An
example may be cited here: The different limbs of the body cannot enjoy
life independently; they must cooperate with the whole body and supply
food to the stomach. In so doing, all the different parts of the body
enjoy equally in cooperation with the whole body. That is the philosophy
of acintya-bhedabheda, simultaneous oneness and difference. The living
entity cannot enjoy life in opposition to the Supreme Lord; he has to
dovetail his activities with Him by practicing bhakti-yoga.

It is said herein that one can approach the Supreme Personality of God-
head by either the yoga process or the bhakti-yoga process. This indicates


--- Page 271 ---
Text 36] Explanation of Devotional Service 1271
that factually there is no difference between yoga and bhakti-yoga because
the target of both is Visnu. In the modern age, however, a yoga process has
been manufactured which aims at something void and impersonal. Actually,
yoga means meditation on the form of Lord Visnu. If the yoga practice is
actually performed according to the standard direction, there is no differ-
ence between yoga and bhakti-yoga.

transcendental; pradhanam—chief; purusam— personality ; daivam— spiritual;

TRANSLATION
This puruga whom the individual soul must approach is the eternal
form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is known as Brahman
and Paramatma. He is the transcendental chief personality, and His
activities are all spiritual.
PURPORT
In order to distinguish the personality whom the individual soul must
approach, it is described herein that this purusa, the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, is the chief amongst all living entities and is the ultimate form
of the impersonal Brahman effulgence and Paramatma manifestation.
Since He is the origin of the Brahman effulgence and Paramatma mani-
festation, He is described herewith as the chief personality. It is confirmed
in the Katha Upanisad, nityo nityandm: there are many eternal living
entities, but He is the chief maintainer. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-
gita also, where Lord Krsna says, aham sarvasya prabhavah: “Il am the
origin of everything, including the Brahman effulgence and Paramatma
manifestation.” His activities are transcendental, as confirmed in Bhagavad-


--- Page 272 ---
1272 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 29
gita. Janma karma ca me divyam: the activities and the appearance and
disappearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are transcendental;
they are not to be considered material. Anyone who knows this fact—that
the appearance, disappearance and activities of the Lord are beyond
material activities or material conception—is liberated. Yo vettitattvatah
tyaktva dehari punar janma: such a person, after quitting his body, does
not come back again to this material world, but goes to the Supreme
Person. It is confirmed here, purusah purusari vrajet: the living entity
goes to the Supreme Personality simply by understanding His transcen-
dental nature and activities.

TRANSLATION

The time factor, who causes the transformation of the various material
manifestations, is another feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Anyone who does not know that time is the same Supreme Personality is
afraid of the time factor.

PURPORT

Everyone is afraid of the activities of time, but a devotee who knows
that the time factor is another representation or manifestation of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead has nothing to fear from the influence
of time. The phrase ripa-bhedaspadam is very significant. By the
influence of time, so many forms are changing. For example, when a
child is born his form is small, but in the course of time that form


--- Page 273 ---
Text 38] Explanation of Devotional Service 1273
changes into a larger form, the body of a boy, and then the body of a
young man. Similarly, everything is changed and transformed by the
time factor or by the indirect control of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Usually we do not see any difference between the body of a
child and the body of a boy or young man because we know that these
changes are due to the action of the time factor. There is cause for fear for
a person who does not know how time acts.

TRANSLATION

Lord Visnu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the enjoyer
of all sacrifices, is the time factor and the master of all masters. He
enters everyone's heart, He is the support of everyone, and He causes
every being to be annihilated by another.

PURPORT

Lord Visnu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is clearly described
in this passage. He is the supreme enjoyer, and all others are working as
His servants. As stated in the Caitanya-caritamrta, ekale vara krsna: the
only Supreme Lord is Visnu. Ara saba bhrtya: all others are His servants.
Lord Brahma, Lord Siva and other demigods are all servants. The same Visnu
enters everyone’s heart as Paramatma, and He causes the annihilation of
every being through another being.

TRANSLATION
No one is dear to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, nor is anyone
His enemy or friend. But He gives inspiration to those who have not
forgotten Him and destroys those who have.
PURPORT
Forgetfulness of one’s relationship with Lord Visnu, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, is the cause of one’s repeated birth and death.
A living entity is as eternal as the Supreme Lord, but due to his forget-
fulness he is put into this material nature and transmigrates from one
body to another, and when the body is destroyed, he thinks that he is
also destroyed. Actually, this forgetfulness of his relationship with Lord
Visnu is the cause of his destruction. Anyone who revives his conscious-
ness of the original relationship receives inspiration from the Lord. This
does not mean that the Lord is someone’s enemy and someone else’s
friend. He helps everyone; one who is not bewildered by the influence of
material energy is saved, and one who is bewildered is destroyed. It is
said, therefore, hari vina na srtim taranti: no one can be saved from
the repetition of birth and death without the help of the Supreme Lord.
It is therefore the duty of all living entities to take shelter of the lotus
feet of Visnu and thus save themselves from the cycle of birth and death.

Out of fear of the Supreme Personality of Godhead the wind blows, out

luster.
PURPORT
The Lord states in Bhagavad-gita, mayddhyaksena prakrtih 58086:
“Nature is working under My direction.” The foolish person thinks that
nature is working automatically, but such an atheistic theory is not
supported in the Vedic literature. Nature is working under the super-
intendence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita, and we also find here that the sun shines under the direction
of the Lord, and the cloud pours forth showers of rain under the direction
of the Lord. All natural phenomena are under superintendence of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu.

Out of fear of the Supreme Personality of Godhead the trees, creepers,
herbs and seasonal plants and flowers blossom and fructify, each in its
own season.
PURPORT
As the sun rises and sets and the seasonal changes ensue at their
appointed times by the superintendence of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, so the seasonal plants, flowers, herbs and trees all grow
under the direction of the Supreme Lord. It is not that plants grow
automatically, without any cause, as the atheistic philosophers say.
Rather, they grow in pursuance of the supreme order of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. It is confirmed in the Vedic literature that the
Lord’s diverse energies are working so nicely that it appears that every-
thing is being done automatically.

Out of fear of the Supreme Personality of Godhead the rivers flow,
and the ocean never overflows. Out of fear of Him only does fire burn
and does the earth, with its mountains, not sink in the water of the
universe.
PURPORT
We can understand from the Vedic literature that this universe is half
filled with water, on which Garbhodakadayi Visnu is lying. From His


--- Page 277 ---
Text 43] Explanation of Devotional Service 1277
abdomen a lotus flower has grown, and within the stem of that lotus
flower all the different planets exist. The material scientist explains that
all these different planets are floating because of the law of gravity or
some other law; but the actual lawmaker is the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. When we speak of law, we must understand that there must be
a lawmaker. The material scientists can discover laws of nature, but they
are unable to recognize the lawmaker. From Srimad-Bhagavatam and
Bhagavad-gita we can know who the lawmaker is: the lawmaker is the
Supreme Personality of Godhead.

It is said here that the planets do not sink. Since they are floating
under the order or energy of the Supreme Godhead, they do not fall
down into the water which covers half the universe. All the planets are
heavy, with their various mountains, seas, oceans, cities, palaces and
buildings, and yet they are floating. It is understood from this passage
that all the other planets that are floating in the air have oceans and
mountains similar to those on this planet.

Subject to the control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the

hold innumerable living entities. The total universal body expands
with its seven coverings under His supreme control.


--- Page 278 ---
1278 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 29
PURPORT
It is understood from this verse that all the planets in outer space are
floating, and they all hold living entities. The word svasatam means those
who breathe, or the living entities. In order to accommodate them, there
are innumerable planets. Every planet is a residence for innumerable
living entities, and the necessary space is provided in the sky by the
supreme order of the Lord. It is also stated here that the total universal
body is increasing. It is covered by seven layers, and as there are five
elements within the universe, so the total elements, in layers, cover the
outside of the universal body. The first layer is of earth, and it is ten
times greater in size than the space within the universe; the second layer
is water, and that is ten times greater than the earthly layer; the third
covering is fire, which is ten times greater than the water covering. In this
way each layer is ten times greater than the previous one.

TRANSLATION
Out of fear of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the directing
demigods in charge of the modes of material nature carry out the functions
of creation, maintenance and destruction; everything animate and inani-
mate within this material world is under their control.
PURPORT
The three modes of material nature, namely goodness, passion and
ignorance, are under the control of three deities—Brahma, Vignu and


--- Page 279 ---
Text 45] Explanation of Devotional Service 1279
Lord Siva. Lord Visnu is in charge of the mode of goodness, Lord Brahma
is in charge of the mode of passion, and Lord Siva is in charge of the
mode of ignorance. Similarly, there are many other demigods in charge
of the air department, the water department, the cloud department, etc.
Just as the government has many different departments, so, within this
material world, the government of the Supreme Lord has many depart-
ments, and all these departments function in proper order out of fear of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Demigods are undoubtedly con-
trolling all matter, animate and inanimate, within the universe, but
above them the supreme controller is the Personality of Godhead. There-
fore in the Brahma-sarihita it is said, isvarah paramah krspah. Undoubtedly
there are many controllers in the departmental management of this
universe, but the supreme controller is Krsna.

There are two kinds of dissolutions. One kind of dissolution takes
place when Brahma goes to sleep during his night, and the final dissolution
takes place when Brahma dies. As long as Brahma does not die, creation,
maintenance and destruction are actuated by different demigods under
the superintendence of the Supreme Lord.

TRANSLATION

The eternal time factor has no beginning and no end. It is the represen-
tative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the maker of the criminal
world. It brings about the end of the phenomenal world, it carries on the
work of creation by bringing one individual into existence from another,


--- Page 280 ---
1280 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 29
and likewise it dissolves the universe by destroying even the lord of death,
Yamaraja.
PURPORT

By the influence of eternal time, which is a representative of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, the father begets a son, and the
father dies by the influence of cruel death. But by time’s influence, even
the lord of cruel death is killed. In other words, all the demigods within
the material world are temporary, like ourselves. Our lives last for 100
years at the most, and similarly, although their lives may last for
millions and billions of years, the demigods are not eternal. No one can
live within this material world eternally. The phenomenal world is
created, maintained and destroyed by the finger signal of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Therefore a devotee does not desire anything in
this material world. A devotee desires only to serve the Supreme Person-
ality of Godhead. This servitude exists eternally; the Lord exists eternally,
His servitor exists cternally, and the service exists eternally.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Third Canto, Twenty-
ninth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled ‘Explanation of
Devotional Service by Lord Kapila.”

The Personality of Godhead said: As a mass of clouds does not know
the powerful influence of the wind, so a person engaged in material con-
sciousness does not know the powerful strength of the time factor by
which he is being carried.
PURPORT
The great politician-papdita named Canakya said that even one moment
of time cannot be returned even if one is prepared to pay millions of
dollars. One cannot calculate the amount of loss there is in wasting valuable
time. Either materially or spiritually, one should be very alert in utilizing
1281


--- Page 282 ---
1282 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 30
the time which he has at his disposal. A conditioned soul lives in a particu-
lar body for a fixed measurement of time, and it is recommended in the
scriptures that within that small measurement of time one has to finish
Krsna consciousness and thus gain release from the influence of the time
factor. But, unfortunately, those who are not in Krgna consciousness are
carried away by the strong power of time without their knowledge, as
clouds are carried by the wind.

TRANSLATION

Whatever is produced by the materialist with great pain and labor for
so-called happiness, the Supreme Personality, as the time factor, destroys,
and for this reason the conditioned soul laments.

PURPORT

The main function of the time factor, which is a representative of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, is to destroy everything. The material-
ists, in material consciousness, are engaged in producing so many things
in the name of economic development. They think that by advancing in
satisfying the material needs of man they will be happy, but they forget
that everything they have produced will be destroyed in due course of
time. From history we can see that there were many powerful empires on
the surface of the globe that were constructed with great pain and great
perseverance, but in due course of time they have all been destroyed. Still


--- Page 283 ---
Text 3] Description of Adverse Fruitive Activities 1283
the foolish materialists cannot understand that they are simply wasting
time in producing material necessities which are destined to be vanquished
in due course of time. This waste of energy is due to the ignorance of the
mass of people, who do not know that they are eternal and that they
have an eternal engagement also. They do not know that this span of life
in a particular type of body is a flash in the eternal journey. Not knowing
this fact, they take the small flash of life to be everything, and they waste
time in improving economic conditions.

TRANSLATION
The misguided materialist does not know that his very body is imper-
manent and that the attractions for home, land and wealth, which are in
relationship to that body, are also temporary. Out of ignorance only, he
thinks that everything is permanent.
PURPORT
The materialist thinks that persons engaged in Krsna consciousness are
crazy fellows wasting time by chanting Hare Krsna, but actually he does
not know that he himself is in the darkest region of craziness because of
accepting his body as permanent. And, in relation to his body, he accepts
his home, his country, his society and all other paraphernalia as perma-
nent. This materialistic acceptance of the permanency of home, land,
etc., is called the illusion of maya. This is clearly mentioned here. Mohad


--- Page 284 ---
1284 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 30
grha-ksetra-vasuni: out of illusion only does the materialist accept his
home, his land and his money as permanent. Out of this illusion, the
family life, national life and economic development which are very im-
portant factors in modern civilization have grown. A Krsna conscious
person knows that this economic development of human society is but
temporary illusion. |
In another part of Srimad-Bhagavatam, the acceptance of the body as
oneself, the acceptance of others as kinsmen in relationship to this body
and the acceptance of the land of one’s birth as worshipable are declared
to be the products of an animal civilization. When, however, one is enlight-
ened in Krsna consciousness, he can use these for the service of the Lord.
That is a very suitable proposition. Everything has a relationship with
Krsna. When all economic development and material advancement are
utilized to advance the cause of Krsna consciousness, a new phase of
progressive life arises.

The living entity, in whatever species of life he appears, finds a particu-

situated in such a condition.
PURPORT
The satisfaction of the living entity in a particular type of body, even if
it is most abominable, is called illusion. A man in a higher position may
feel dissatisfaction with the standard of life of a lower grade man, but the


--- Page 285 ---
Text 5] Description of Adverse Fruitive Activities 1285
lower grade man is satisfied in that position because of the spell of maya,
the external energy. Mdyd has two phases of activities. One is called
praksepatmikd, and another is called @varanatmikd. Avarapatmika means
“covering,” and praksepatmika means “pulling down.” In any condition
of life, the materialistic person or animal will be satisfied because his
knowledge is covered by the influence of mdyd. In the lower grade or
lower species of life, the development of consciousness is so poor that
one cannot understand whether he is happy or distressed. This is called
avaranatmika. Even a hog, who lives by eating stool, finds himself happy,
although a person in a higher mode of life sees that the hog is eating stool.
How abominable that life is!

TRANSLATION

The conditioned living entity is satisfied in his own particular species of
life; while deluded by the covering influence of the illusory energy, he feels
little inclined to cast off his body, even when in hell, for he takes delight
in hellish enjoyment.

PURPORT

It is said that once Indra, the king of heaven, was cursed by his spiritual
master, Brhaspati, on account of his misbehavior, and he became a hog on
this planet. After many days, when Brahma wanted to recall him to his
heavenly kingdom, Indra, in the form of a hog, forgot everything of his
royal position in the heavenly kingdom, and he refused to go back. This is


--- Page 286 ---
1286 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 30
the spell of maya. Even Indra forgets his heavenly standard of life and is
satisfied with the standard of a hog’s life. By the influence of maya the
conditioned soul becomes so affectionate towards his particular type of
body that if he is offered, “Give up this body, and immediately you will
have a king’s body,” he will not agree. This attachment strongly affects
all conditioned living entities. Lord Krsna is personally canvassing, “Give
up everything in this material world. Come to Me, and I shall give you all
protection,” but we are not agreeable. We think, “We are quite all right.
Why should we surrender unto Krsna and go back to His kingdom?** This
is called illusion, or maya. Everyone is satisfied with his standard of living,
however abominable it may be.

TRANSLATION
Such satisfaction with one’s standard of living is due to deep-rooted
attraction for body, wife, home, children, animals, wealth and friends. In
such association, the conditioned soul thinks himself quite perfect.
PURPORT
This so-called perfection of human life is a concoction. Therefore, it is
said that the materialist, however materially qualified he may be, is worth-
less because he is hovering on the mental plane, which will drag him again
to the material existence of temporary life. One who acts on the mental
plane cannot get promotion to the spiritual. Such a person is always sure
to glide down again to material life. In the association of so-called society,
friendship and love, the conditioned soul appears completely satisfied.

TRANSLATION
Although he is always burning with anxiety, such a fool always performs
all kinds of mischievous activities, with a hope which is never to be fulfilled,
in order to maintain his so-called family and society.
PURPORT
It is said that it is easier to maintain a great empire than to maintain a
small family, especially in these days, when the influence of Kali-yuga is so
strong that everyone is harassed and full of anxieties because of accepting
the false presentation of maya’s family. The family which we maintain is
created by mdya; it is the perverted reflection of the family in Krsnaloka.
In Krsnaloka there are also family, friends, society, father and mother;
everything is there, but they are eternal. Here, as we change bodies, our
family relationships also change. Sometimes we are in a family of human
beings, sometimes in a family of demigods, sometimes a family of cats, or
sometimes a family of dogs. Family, society and friendship are flickering,
and so they are called asat. It is said that as long as we are attached to this
asat, temporary, nonexisting society and family, we are always full of
anxieties. The materialists do not know that the family, society and
friendship here in this material world are only shadows, and thus they
become attached. Naturally their hearts are always burning, but in spite of
all inconvenience, they still work to maintain such false families because
they have no information of the real family association with Krsna.

TRANSLATION

He gives heart and senses to a woman who falsely charms him with
maya. He enjoys solitary embraces and talking with her, and he is enchant-
ed by the sweet words of the small children.

PURPORT

Family life within the kingdom of illusory energy, mdyd, is just like a
prison for the eternal living entity. In prison a prisoner is shackled by iron
chains and iron bars. Similarly, a conditioned soul is shackled by the
charming beauty of a woman, by her solitary embraces and talks of so-
called love, and by the sweet words of his small children. Thus he forgets
his real identity.

In this verse the words strinam asatinam indicate that womanly love is
just to agitate the mind of man. Actually, in the material world there is no
love. Both the woman and the man are interested in their sense gratifica-
tion. For sense gratification a woman creates an illusory love, and the man
becomes enchanted by such false love and forgets his real duty. When
there are children as the result of such a combination, the next attraction
is to the sweet words of the children. The love of the woman at home and
the talk of the children make one a secure prisoner, and thus he cannot
leave his home. Such a person is termed, in Vedic language, 9 grhamedhi,
which means one whose center of attraction is home. Grhastha refers to
one who lives with family, wife and children but whose real purpose of


--- Page 289 ---
Text 9] Description of Adverse Fruitive Activities 1289
living is to develop Krsna consciousness. One is therefore advised to be-
come a grhastha and not a grhamedhi. The grhastha’s concern is to get
out of the family life created by illusion and enter into real family life
with Krsna, whereas the grhamedhi’s business is to repeatedly chain him-
self to so-called family life, in one life after another, and perpetually
remain in the darkness of mdyd.

TRANSLATION
The attached householder remains in his family life, which is full of
diplomacy and politics. Always spreading miseries and controlled by acts
of sense gratification, he acts just to counteract the reactions of all his
miseries, and if he can successfully counteract such miseries, he thinks
that he is happy.
PURPORT
In Bhagavad-gitdi the Personality of Godhead Himself certifies the
material world as an impermanent place that is full of miseries. There is no
question of happiness in this material world, either individually or in terms
of family, society or country. If something is going on in the name of
happiness, that is also illusion. Here in this material world, happiness means
successful counteraction to the effects of distress. The material world is so
made that unless one becomes a clever diplomat, his life will be a failure.
Not to speak of human society, even the society of lower animals, the
birds and bees, cleverly manages its bodily demands of eating, sleeping


--- Page 290 ---
1290 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 30
and mating. Human society competes nationally or individually, and in
the attempt to be successful, the entire human society becomes full of
diplomacy. We should always remember that in spite of all diplomacy
and all intelligence in the struggle for our existence, everything will end in
asecond by the supreme will. Therefore, all our attempts to become happy
in this material world are simply a delusion offered by maya.

TRANSLATION
He secures money by committing violence here and there, and although
he employs it in the service of his family, he himself eats only a little
portion of the food thus purchased, and he goes to hell for those for whom
he earned the money in such an irregular way.
PURPORT
There is a Bengali proverb, “The person for whom I have stolen accuses
me of being a thief.” The family members, for whom an attached person
acts in so many criminal ways, are never satisfied. In illusion an attached
person serves such family members, and by serving them he is destined to
enter into a hellish condition of life. For example, a thief steals something
to maintain his family, and he is caught and imprisoned. This is the sum
and substance of material existence and attachment to material society,
friendship and love. Although an attached family man is always engaged


--- Page 291 ---
Text 11] Description of Adverse Fruitive Activities 1291
in getting money by hook or by crook for the maintenance of his family,
he cannot enjoy more than what he could consume even without such
criminal activities. A man who eats eight ounces of foodstuffs may have
to maintain a big family and earn money by any means to support that
family, but he himself is not offered more than what he can eat, and
sometimes he eats the remnants that are left after his family members are
fed. Even by earning money by unfair means, he cannot enjoy life for
himself. That is called the covering illusion of maya.

The process of illusory service to society, country and community is
exactly the same everywhere; the same principle is applicable even to big
national leaders. A national leader who is very great in serving his country
is sometimes killed by his countrymen because of irregular service. In
other words, one cannot satisfy his dependents by this illusory service,
although one cannot get out of the service because servant is his constitu-
tional position. A living entity is constitutionally part and parcel of the
Supreme Being, but he forgets that he has to render service to the Supreme
Being and diverts his attention to serve others; this is called maya. By
serving others he falsely thinks that he is master. The head of a family
thinks of himself as the master of the family, or the leader of a nation
thinks of himself as the master of the nation, whereas actually he is
serving, and by serving maya he is gradually going to hell. Therefore, a
sane man should come to the point of Krsna consciousness and engage
in the service of the Supreme Lord, applying his whole life, all of his
wealth, his entire intelligence and his full power of speaking.

TRANSLATION
Seeing him unable to support them, his wife and others do not treat him
with the same respect as before, even as miserly farmers do not accord the
same treatment to their old and worn-out oxen.
PURPORT
Not only in the present age but from time immemorial, no one has liked
an old man who is unable to earn in the family. Even in the modern age, in
some communities or states, the old men are given poison so that they
will die as soon as possible. In some cannibalistic communities, the old
grandfather is sportingly killed, and a feast is held in which his body is
eaten. The example is given that a farmer does not like an old bull who
has ceased to work. Similarly, when an attached person in family life
becomes old and is unable to earn, he is no longer liked by his wife, sons,
daughters and other kinsmen, and he is consequently neglected, what to
speak of not being given respect. It is judicious, therefore, to give up
family attachment before one attains old age and take shelter of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. One should employ himself in His
service so that the Supreme Lord can take charge of him and he will not
be neglected by his so-called kinsmen.

PURPORT
Family attraction is so strong that even if one is neglected by family
members in his old age, he cannot give up family affection, and he remains
at home just like a dog. In the Vedic way of life one has to give up family
life when he is strong enough. It is advised that before getting too weak and
being baffled in material activities, and before becoming diseased, one
should give up family life and engage oneself completely in the service of
the Lord for the remaining days of his life. It is enjoined, therefore, in the
Vedic scriptures, that as soon as one passes fifty years of age, he must give
up family life and live alone in the forest. After preparing himself fully, he
should become a sannyasi to distribute the knowledge of spiritual life to
each and every home.

Thus he remains at home just like a pet dog and eats whatever is so neg-

an invalid who cannot work any more.
PURPORT
Before meeting death one is sure to become a diseased invalid, and when
he is neglected by his family members, his life becomes less than a dog's be-
cause he is put into so many miserable conditions of life. Vedic literatures
enjoin, therefore, that before the arrival of such miserable conditions, one
should leave home and die without the knowledge of his family members.


--- Page 295 ---
Text 17] Description of Adverse Fruitive Activities 1295
If a man leaves home and dies without his family’s knowing, that is consi-
dered to be a glorious death. But an attached family man wants his family
members to carry him in a greal procession even after his death, and al-
though he will not be able to see how the procession goes, still he desires
that his body be taken gorgeously in procession. Thus he is happy without
even knowing where he has to go when he leaves his body for the next life.

In this way he comes under the clutches of death and lies down,

PURPORT
For formality’s sake, when a man is lying on his deathbed, his relatives
come to him, and sometimes they cry very loudly, addressing the dying
man: “Oh, my father!” “Oh, my friend!” or “Oh, my husband!” In that
pitiable condition the dying man wants to speak with them and instruct
them of his desires, but because he is fully under the control of the time
factor, death, he cannot express himself, and that causes him inconceivable
pain. He is already in a painful condition because of disease, and his glands
and throat are choked up with mucus. He is already in a very difficult po-
sition, and when he is addressed by his relatives in that way, his grief in-
creases.

TRANSLATION

Thus the man, who engaged with uncontrolled senses in maintaining a
family, dies in great grief, seeing his relatives crying. He dies most pathet-
ically, in great pain and without consciousness.

PURPORT

In Bhagavad-gita it is said that at the time of death one will be absorbed
in the thoughts which he cultivated during his lifetime. A person who had
no other idea than to properly maintain his family members must have
family affairs in his last thoughts. That is the natural sequence for a
common man. The common man does not know the destiny of his life; he
is simply busy in his flash of life, maintaining his family. At the last stage,
no one is satisfied with how he has improved the family economic con-
dition; everyone thinks that he could not provide sufficiently. Because of
his deep family affection, he forgets his main duty of controlling the senses
and improving his spiritual consciousness. Sometimes a dying man entrusts
the family affairs to either his son or some relative, saying, “I am going.
Please look after the family.” He does not know where he is going, but
even at the time of death he is anxious about how his family will be main-
tained. Sometimes it is seen that a dying man requests the physician to
increase his life at least for a few years so that the family maintenance plan
which he has begun can be completed. These are the material diseases of
the conditioned soul. He completely forgets his real engagement—to be-
come Krsna conscious—and is always serious about planning to maintain
his family, although he changes families one after another.

At death, he sees the messengers of the lord of death come before him,

their eyes full of wrath, and in great fear he passes stool and urine.
PURPORT

There are two kinds of transmigration of a living entity after passing
away from the present body. One kind of transmigration is to go to the
controller of sinful activities, who is known as Yamaraja, and the other is
to go to the higher planets up to Vaikuntha. Here Lord Kapila describes
how persons engaged in activities of sense gratification to maintain a fami-
ly are treated by the messengers of Yamaraja, called Yamadutas. At the
time of death the Yamaditas become the custodians of those persons who
have strongly gratified their senses. They take charge of the dying man
and take him to the planet where Yamaraja resides. The conditions there
are described in the following verses.

As a criminal is arrested for punishment by the constables of the state,

a person engaged in criminal sense gratification is similarly arrested by


--- Page 299 ---
Text 21] Description of Adverse Fruitive Activities 1299
the Yamadutas, who bind him by the neck with strong rope and cover
his subtle body so that he may undergo severe punishment.

PURPORT

Every living entity is covered by a subtle and gross body. The subtle
body is the covering of mind, ego, intelligence and consciousness. It is
said in the scriptures that the constables of Yamaraja cover the subtle
body of the culprit and take him to the abode of Yamaraja to be pun-
ished in a way that he is able to tolerate. He does not die from this pun-
ishment because if he died, then who would suffer the punishment? It is
not the business of the constables of Yamaraja to put one to death. In
fact, it is not possible to kill a living entity because factually he is eternal;
he simply has to suffer the consequences of his activities of sense
gratification.

The process of punishment is explained in the Caitanya-caritamyta.
Formerly the king’s men would take a criminal in a boat in the middle
of the river. They would dunk him by grasping a bunch of his hair and
thrusting him completely underwater, and when he was almost suffocated,
the king's constables would take him out of the water and allow him to
breathe for some time, and then they would again dunk him in the water
to suffocate. This sort of punishment is inflicted upon the forgotten soul
by Yamaraja, as will be described in the following verses.

tressed.
PURPORT
It appears from this verse that while passing from this planet to the
planet of Yamaraja, the culprit arrested by Yamaraja’s constables meets
many dogs, who bark and bite just to remind him of his criminal activities
of sense gratification. It is said in Bhagavad-gita that one becomes almost
blind and is bereft of all sense when he is infuriated by the desire for sense
gratification. He forgets everything. Kamais tais tair hrta-jianah. One is
bereft of all intelligence when he is too attracted by sense gratification, and
he forgets that he has to suffer the consequences also. Here the chance for
recounting his activities of sense gratification is given by the dogs engaged
by Yamaraja. While we live in the gross body, such activities of sense
gratification are encouraged even by modern government regulations. In
every state all over the world, such activities are encouraged by the govern-
ment in the form of birth control. Women are supplied pills, and they are
allowed to go to a clinical laboratory to get assistance for abortion. This
is going on as a result of sense gratification. Actually sex life is meant for
begetting a good child, but because people have no control over the
senses and there is no institution to train them to control the senses, the
poor fellows fall victim to the criminal offenses of sense gratification, and
they are punished after death as described in these pages of Srimad-
Bhagavatam.

Under the scorching sun, the criminal has to pass through roads of hot

constables because of his inability to walk, and he is afflicted by hunger
and thirst, but unfortunately there is no drinking water, no shelter and no
place for rest on the road.

TRANSLATION
Thus he has to pass 99,000 yojanas within two or three moments, and
then he is at once engaged in the torturous punishment which he is des-
tined to suffer.
PURPORT
One yojana is calculated to be eight miles, and he has to pass along a
road which is therefore as much as 792,000 miles. Such a long distance is
passed over within a few moments only. The subtle body is covered by the
constables so that the living entity can pass such a long distance quickly
and at the same time tolerate the suffering. This covering, although mate-
rial, is of such fine elements that material scientists cannot discover what
the coverings are made of. To pass 792,000 miles within a few moments
seems wonderful to the modern space travelers. They have so far traveled
at a speed of 18,000 miles per hour, but here we see that a criminal passes
792,000 miles within a few seconds only, although the process is not
spiritual but material.

men?” will be narrated. The first description is that the criminal has to eat
his own flesh, burning with fire, or allow others like himself who are
present there to eat. In the last great war people in concentration camps
sometimes ate their own stool, so there is no wonder that in the Yama-
sadana, the abode of Yamaraja, one who had a very enjoyable life eating
others’ flesh has to eat his own flesh.

Text 29] Description of Adverse Fruitive Activities 1305
PURPORT
Materialistic life is based on sex life. The existence of all the material-
istic people who are undergoing severe tribulation in the struggle for
existence is based on sex. Therefore, in the Vedic civilization sex life is
allowed only in a restricted way; it is for the married couple and only
for begetting children. But when sex life is indulged in for sense gratifica-
tion illegally and illicitly, both the man and the woman await severe
punishment in this world or after death. In this world also they are pun-
ished by virulent diseases like syphillis and gonorrhea, and in the next
life, as we see in this passage of Srimad-Bhagavatam, they are put into
different kinds of hellish conditions to suffer. In Bhagavad-gita, First
Chapter, illicit sex life is also very much condemned, and it is said that
one who produces children by illicit sex life is sent to hell. It is confirmed
here in the Bhdgavatam that such offenders are put into hellish conditions
of life in Tamisra, Andha-tamisra and Raurava.

therefore confirms them by saying that these hellish conditions are also
visible on this planet. It is not that they are only on the planet where
Yamaraja lives. On the planet of Yamaraja, the sinful man is given the
chance to practice living in the hellish conditions which he will have to en-
dure in the next life, and then he is given a chance to take birth on another
planet to continue his hellish life. For example, if a man is to be punished
to remain in hell and eat stool and urine, then first of all he practices such
habits on the planets of Yamaraja, and then he is given a particular type of
body, the hog, so that he can eat stool and think that he is enjoying life. It
is stated previously that in any hellish condition, the conditioned soul
thinks he is happy. Otherwise, it would not be possible for him to suffer
hellish life.

After leaving this body, the man who maintained himself and his family
members by sinful activities suffers a hellish life, and his relatives suffer
also.

PURPORT

The mistake of modern civilization is that man does not believe in the
next life. But whether he believes or not, the next life is there, and one has
to suffer if one does not lead a responsible life in terms of the injunctions
of authoritative scriptures like the Vedas and Puranas. Species lower than
human beings are not responsible for their actions because they are made
to act in a certain way, but in the developed life of human consciousness,


--- Page 307 ---
Text 31] Description of Adverse Fruitive Activities 1307
if one is not responsible for his activities, then he is sure to get a hellish
life, as described herein.

TRANSLATION
He goes alone to the darkest regions of hell after quitting the present
body, and the money which he acquired by envying other living entities is
the passage money with which he leaves this world.
PURPORT
When a man earns money by unfair means and maintains his family and
himself with that money, the money is enjoyed by many members of the
family, but he alone goes to hell. A person who enjoys life by earning
money or by envying anothers life, and who enjoys with family and
friends, will have to enjoy alone the resultant sinful reactions accrued from
such violent and illicit life. For example, if a man secures some money by
killing someone and with that money maintains his family, those who
enjoy the black money earned by him are also partially responsible and
are also sent to hell, but he who is the leader is especially punished. The
result of material enjoyment is that one takes with him the sinful reaction
only, and not the money. The money he earned is left in this world, and
he takes only the reaction.
In this world also, if a person acquires some money by murdering some-
one, the family is not hanged, although its members are sinfully contami-
nated. But the man who commits the murder and maintains his family is


--- Page 308 ---
1308 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 30
himself hanged as a murderer. The direct offender is more responsible for
sinful activities than the indirect enjoyer. The great learned scholar Canakya
Pandita says, therefore, that whatever one has in his possession had better
be spent for the cause of sat, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, be-
cause one cannot take his possessions with him. They remain here, and
they will be lost. Either we leave the money or the money leaves us,
but we will be separated. The best use of money as long as it is within our
possession is to spend it to acquire Krgna consciousness.

TRANSLATION
Thus, by the arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the
maintainer of kinsmen is put into a hellish condition to suffer for his sin-
ful activities, like a man who has lost his wealth.
PURPORT
The example set herein is that the sinful person suffers just like a man
who has lost his wealth. The human form of body is achieved by the con-
ditioned soul after many, many births and is a very valuable asset. Instead
of utilizing this life to get liberation, if one uses it simply for the purpose
of maintaining his so-called family and therefore performs foolish and un-
authorized action, he is compared to a man who has lost his wealth and
who, upon losing it, laments. When wealth is lost, there is no use lamenting,
but as long as there is wealth, one has to utilize it properly and thereby gain


--- Page 309 ---
Text 33] Description of Adverse Fruitive Activities 1309
eternal profit. It may be argued that when a man leaves his money earned
by sinful activities, then he also leaves his sinful activities here with his
money. But it is especially mentioned herein that by superior arrange-
ment, (daivenasaditam), although the man leaves behind him his sinfully
earned money, he carries the effect of it. When a man steals some money,
if he is caught and agrees to return it, he is not freed from the criminal
punishment. By the law of the state, even though he returns the money, he
has to undergo the punishment. Similarly, the money which is earned by a
criminal process may be left by the man when dying, but by superior
arrangement he carries with him the effect, and therefore he has to suffer
hellish life.

TRANSLATION

Therefore a person who is very eager to maintain his family and kins-
men simply by black methods certainly goes to the darkest region of hell,
which is known as Andha-tamisra.

PURPORT

Three words in this verse are very significant. Kevalena means only by
black methods, adharmena means unrighteous or irreligious, and kutumba-
bharana means family maintenance. Maintaining one’s family is cer-
tainly the duty of a householder, but one should be eager to earn his liveli-
hood by the prescribed method, as stated in the scriptures. In Bhagavad-
gita it is described that the Lord has divided the social system into four


--- Page 310 ---
1310 Srimad-Bhagavatam [ Canto 3, Ch. 30
classifications of castes, or varnas, according to quality and work. Apart
from Bhagavad-gita, in every society a man is known according to his qual-
ity and work. For example, when a man is constructing wooden furniture,
he is called a carpenter, and a man who works with an anvil and iron is
called a blacksmith. Similarly, a man who is engaged in the medical or en-
gineering fields has a particular duty and designation. All these human
activities have been divided by the Supreme Lord into four varpas, namely
brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya and Sidra. In Bhagavad-gita and in other Vedic
literatures, the specific duties of the brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya and sudra
are mentioned.

One should work honestly according to his qualification. He should not
earn his livelihood unfairly, by means for which he is not qualified. If a
brahmana who works as a priest so that he may enlighten his followers
with the spiritual way of life is not qualified as a priest, then he is cheating
the public. One should not earn by such unfair means. The same is appli-
cable to a ksatriya or to a vaisya. It is especially mentioned that the means
of livelihood of those who are trying to advance in Krsna consciousness
must be very fair and uncomplicated. Here it is mentioned that he who
earns his livelihood by unfair means (kevalena) is sent to the darkest hellish
region. Otherwise, if one maintains his family by prescribed methods and
honest means, there is no objection to one’s being a family man.

Text 34] Description of Adverse Fruitive Activities 1311
human birth, and having thus been purged of his sins, one is reborn again
as a human being on this earth.
PURPORT
Just as a prisoner who has undergone troublesome prison life is set free
again, similarly the person who has always engaged in impious and mis-
chievous activities is put into hellish conditions, and when he has under-
gone different hellish lives, namely those of lower animals like cats, dogs
and hogs, by the gradual process of evolution he again comes back as a
human being. In Bhagavad-gita it is stated that even though a person en-
gaged in the practice of the yoga system may not finish perfectly and may
fall down for some reason or other, his next life as a human being is
guaranteed. It is stated that such a person, who has fallen from the path of
yoga practice, is given a chance in his next life to take birth in a very rich
family or in a very pious family. It is interpreted that “rich family” refers
to a big mercantile family because generally people who engage in trades
and mercantile business are very rich. One who engaged in the process of
self-realization or connecting with the Supreme Absolute Truth but fell
short is allowed to take birth in such a rich family, or he is allowed to take
birth in the family of pious brahmanas; either way, he is guaranteed to ap-
pear in human society in his next life. It can be concluded that if someone
is not willing to enter into hellish life, as in Tamisra or Andha-tamisra, then
he must take to the process of Krsna consciousness, which is the first-class
yoga system, because even if one is unable to attain complete Krsna con-
sciousness in this life, he is guaranteed at least to take his next birth in a
human family. He cannot be sent into a hellish condition. Krsna conscious-
ness is the purest life, and it protects all human beings from gliding down
to hell to take birth in a family of dogs or hogs.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports to the Third Canto, Thirtieth
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “Description by Lord Kapila
of Adverse Fruitive Activities.”

TRANSLATION
The Personality of Godhead said: Under the supervision of the Supreme
Lord and according to the result of his work, the living entity, the soul,
is made to enter into the womb of a woman through the particle of male
semina to assume a particular type of body.
PURPORT
As stated in the last chapter, after suffering different kinds of hellish
conditions, a man comes again to the human form of body. The same
topic is continued in this chapter. In order to give a particular type of
1313


--- Page 313 ---
1314 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 31
human form to a person who has already suffered hellish life, the soul is
transferred to the semina of a man who is just suitable to become his
father. During sexual intercourse, the soul is transferred through the
semina of the father into the mother’s womb in order to produce a
particular type of body. This process is applicable to all embodied living
entities, but it is especially mentioned for the man who was transferred to
the Andha-tamisra hell. After suffering there, when he who has had many
types of hellish bodies, like those of dogs and hogs, is to come again to the
human form, he is given the chance to take his birth in the same type of
body from which he degraded himself to hell.

Everything is done by the supervision of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Material nature supplies the body, but it does so under the
direction of the Supersoul. It is said in Bhagavad-gitd that a living
entity is wandering in this material world on a chariot made by material
nature. The Supreme Lord, as Supersoul, is always present with the
individual soul. He directs material nature to supply a particular type of
body to the individual soul according to the result of his work, and the
material nature supplies it. Here one word, retah-kanasrayah, is very
significant because it indicates that it is not the semina of the man that
creates life within the womb of a woman; rather, the living entity, the
soul, takes shelter in a particle of semina and is then pushed into the womb
of a woman. Then the body develops. There is no possibility of creating a
living entity without the presence of the soul simply by sexual intercourse.
The materialistic theory that there is no soul and that a child is born simply
by material combination of a man’s and woman’s semina is not very
feasible. It is unacceptable.

TRANSLATION
On the first night, the semina and ovum mix, and on the fifth night the
mixture ferments into a bubble. On the tenth night it develops into a form
like a plum, and after that, gradually it turns into a lump of flesh or an
egg, as the case may be.
PURPORT
The body of the soul develops in four different ways according to its
different sources. One kind of body, that of the trees and plants, sprouts
from the earth; the second kind of body grows from perspiration, as with
flies, germs and bugs; the third kind of body develops from eggs; and the
fourth develops from an embryo. This verse indicates that after emulsifica-
tion of the ovum and semina, the body gradually develops either into a
lump of flesh or into an egg, as the case may be. In the case of birds it
develops into an egg, and in the case of animals and human beings it
develops into a lump of flesh.

months, hands, feet and other limbs take shape. By the end of three
months, the nails, fingers, toes, body hair, bones and skin appear, as do
the organ of generation and the other apertures in the body, namely the
eyes, nostrils, ears, mouth and anus.

Within four months from the date of conception, the seven essential
ingredients of the body, namely, chyle, blood, flesh, fat, bone, marrow
and semina, come into existence. At the end of five months, hunger and
thirst make themselves felt, and at the end of six months, the fetus,
enclosed by the amnion, begins to move on the right side of the abdomen.
PURPORT
When the body of the child is completely formed at the end of six
months, the child, if he is male, begins to move on the right side, and if
female, she tries to move on the left side.

TRANSLATION

Deriving its nutrition from the food and drink taken by the mother, the
fetus grows and remains in that abominable residence of stools and urine,
which is the breeding place of all kinds of worms.

PURPORT

In the Markandeya Purana it is said that in the intestine of the mother
the umbilical cord, which is known as @pydyani, joins the mother to the
abdomen of the child, and through this passage the child within the womb
accepts the mother’s assimilated foodstuff. In this way the child is fed by
the mother’s intestine within the womb and grows from day to day. The
statement of the Markandeya Purana about the child’s situation within
the womb is exactly corroborated by modern medical science, and thus
the authority of the Purdpas cannot be disproved, as is sometimes at-
tempted by the Mayavadi philosophers.

Since the child depends completely on the assimilated foodstuff of the
mother, during pregnancy there are restrictions on the food taken by the
mother. Too much salt, chili, onion and similar food is forbidden for the
pregnant mother because the child’s body is too delicate and new for
him to tolerate such pungent food. Restrictions and precautions to be
taken by the pregnant mother, as enunciated in the smrti scriptures of
Vedic literature, are very useful. We can understand from the Vedic litera-
ture how much care is taken to beget a nice child in society. The
garbhadhana ceremony before sexual intercourse was compulsory for
persons in the higher grades of society, and it is very scientific. Other
processes recommended in the Vedic literature during pregnancy are also
very important. To take care of the child is the primary duty of the
parents because if such care is taken, society will be filled with good
population to maintain the peace and prosperity of the society, country
and human race.

TRANSLATION

Bitten again and again all over the body by the hungry worms in the
abdomen itself, the child suffers terrible agony because of his tenderness.
He thus becomes unconscious moment after moment because of the
terrible condition.

PURPORT

The miserable condition of material existence is not only felt when we
come out of the womb of the mother, but it is also present within the
womb. Miserable life begins from the moment the living entity begins to
contact his material body. Unfortunately, we forget this experience and do
not take the miseries of birth very seriously. In Bhagavad-gita, therefore, it
is specifically mentioned that one should be very alert to understand the
specific difficulties of birth and death. Just as during the formation of this
body we have to pass through so many difficulties within the womb of the
mother, similarly, at the time of death, there are also many difficulties. As
described in the previous chapter, one has to transmigrate from one body
to another, and the transmigration into the bodies of dogs and hogs is
especially miserable. But despite such miserable conditions, due to the
spell of maya we forget everything and become enamored by the present
so-called happiness, which is described as actually no more than a counter-
action to distress.

Owing to the mother’s eating bitter, pungent foodstuffs, or food

pains which are almost intolerable.
PURPORT
All descriptions of the child’s bodily situation in the womb of the
mother are beyond our conception. 1t is very difficult to remain in such a
position, but still the child has to remain. Because his consciousness is not
very developed, the child can tolerate it, otherwise he would die. That is
the benediction of maya, who endows the suffering body with the qualifi-
cations for tolerating such terrible tortures.

PURPORT
If a grown-up man were put into such a condition as the child within
the abdomen, completely entangled in all respects, it would be impossible
for him to live even for a few seconds. Unfortunately, we forget all these
sufferings and try to be happy in this life, not caring for the liberation of
the soul from the entanglement of birth and death. It is an unfortunate
civilization in which these matters are not plainly discussed to make
people understand the precarious condition of material existence.

the possibility of peace of mind in that condition?
PURPORT
After birth the child may forget about the difficulties of his past lives,
but when we are grown up we can at least understand the grievous tortures


--- Page 320 ---
Text 10] The Movements of the Living Entities 1321
undergone at birth and death by reading the authorized scriptures like
Srimad-Bhagavatam. If we do not believe in the scriptures, that is a
different question, but if we have faith in the authority of such descrip-
tions, then we must prepare for our freedom in the next life; that is
possible in this human form of life. One who does not take heed of these
indications of suffering in human existence is said to be undoubtedly
committing suicide. It is said that this human form of life is the only means
for crossing over the nescience of maya, or material existence. We have a
very efficient boat in this human form of body, and there is a very expert
captain, the spiritual master; the scriptural injunctions are like favorable
winds. If we do not cross over the ocean of nescience of material existence
in spite of all these facilities, then certainly we are all intentionally com-
mitting suicide.

TRANSLATION

Thus endowed with the development of consciousness from the seventh
month after his conception, the child is tossed downward by the airs that
press the embryo during the weeks preceding delivery. Like the worms
born of the same filthy abdominal cavity, he cannot remain in one place.

PURPORT

At the end of the seventh month the child is moved by the bodily air

and does not remain in the same place because the entire uterine system


--- Page 321 ---
1322 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 31
becomes slackened before delivery. The worms have been described here
as sodara. Sodara means born of the same mother. Since the child is born
from the womb of the mother and the worms are also born of fermenta-
tion within the womb of the same mother, under the circumstances the
child and the worms are actually brothers. We are very anxious to
establish universal brotherhood among human beings, but we should take
into consideration that even the worms are our brothers, what to speak
of other living entities. Therefore, we should be concerned about all living
entities.

It is said that when a woman is having labor pains she promises that she
will never again become pregnant and suffer from such a severely painful
condition. Similarly, when one is undergoing some surgical operation he
promises that he will never again act in such a way as to become diseased
and have to undergo medical surgery, or when one falls into danger, he
promises that he will never again make the same mistake. Similarly, the
living entity, when put into the hellish condition of life, prays to the Lord


--- Page 322 ---
Text 12] The Movements of the Living Entities 1323
that he will never again commit sinful activities and have to be put into the
womb for repeated birth and death. In the hellish condition within the
womb the living entity is very much afraid of being born again, but when
he is out of the womb, when he is in full life and good health, he forgets
everything and commits again and again the same sins for which he was put
into that horrible condition of existence.

can give me relief from all fear and from Him I have received this condition
of life, which is just befitting my impious activities.


--- Page 323 ---
1324 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 31
PURPORT

The word calac-caranaravindam means the Supreme Personality of
Godhead who actually walks or travels upon the surface of the world. For
example, Lord Ramacandra actually walked on the surface of the world,
and Lord Krsna also walked just like an ordinary man. The prayer is there-
fore offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who descends to the
surface of this earth, or any part of this universe, for the protection of the
pious and the destruction of the impious. It is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita
that when there is an increase of irreligion and discrepancies arise in the
real religious activities, the Supreme Lord comes to protect the pious and
kill the impious. This verse indicates Lord Krsna.

Another significant point in this verse is that the Lord comes, icchaya,
by His own will. As Krsna confirms in Bhagavad-gita, sambhavamy
atma-mayaya: “1 appear at My will, by My internal potential power.” He
is not forced to come by the laws of material nature. It is stated here,
icchaya: He does not assume any form, as the impersonalists think,
because He comes at His own will, and the form in which He descends is
His eternal form. As the Supreme Lord puts the living entity into the
condition of horrible existence, so He can also deliver him, and therefore
one should seek shelter at the lotus feet of Krsna. Krsna demands, “Give up
everything and surrender unto Me.” And it is also said in Bhagavad-gita
that anyone who approaches Him does not come back again to accept
form in material existence, bul goes back to Godhead, back home,
never to return.

I, the pure soul, appearing now to be bound up by my activities, am
lying in the womb of my mother by the arrangement of maya. I offer my
respectful obeisances unto Him who is also here with me but who is
unaffected and changeless. He is unlimited, but He is perceived in the
repentant heart. To Him I offer my respectful obeisances.

PURPORT

As stated in the previous verse, the jiva soul says, “I take shelter of the
Supreme Lord.” Therefore, constitutionally, the jiva soul is the subordinate
servitor of the Supreme Soul, the Personality of Godhead. Both the Su-
preme Soul and the jiva soul are sitting in the same body, as confirmed in
the Upanisads. They are sitting as friends, but one is suffering, and the
other is aloof from the suffering condition of life.

In this verse it is said, visuddham avikaram akhanda-bodham: the
Supersoul is always sitting apart from all contamination. The living entity
is contaminated and is suffering because he has a material body, but that
does not mean that because the Lord is also with him, He also has a
material body. He is avikdram, changeless. He is always the same
Supreme, but unfortunately the Mayavadi philosophers, because of their
impure hearts, cannot understand that the Supreme Soul, the Supersoul,
is different from the individual soul. It is said here, dtapyamdna-
hrdaye ’vasitam: He is in the heart of every living entity, but He can be
realized only by a soul who is repentant. The individual soul becomes
repentant that he forgot his constitutional position, wanted to become
one with the Supreme Soul and tried his best to lord it over material
nature. He has been baffled, and therefore he is repentant. At that time,
Supersoul, or the relationship between the Supersoul and the individual
soul, is realized. As it is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita, after many, many
births the knowledge comes to the conditioned soul that Vasudeva is
great, He is master, and He is Lord. The individual soul is the servant, and
therefore he surrenders unto Him. At that time he becomes a mahatma, a
great soul. Therefore, a fortunate living being who comes to this under-
standing, even within the womb of his mother, has his liberation assured.

I am separated from the Supreme Lord because of my being in this
material body, which is made of five elements, and therefore my qualities
and senses are being misused, although I am essentially spiritual. Because
the Supreme Personality of Godhead is transcendental to material nature
and the living entities, because He is devoid of such a material body, and
because He is always glorious in His spiritual qualities, 1 offer my
obeisances unto Him.
PURPORT
The difference between the living entity and the Supreme Personality
of Godhead is that the living entity is prone to be subjected to material
nature, whereas the Supreme Godhead is always transcendental to material
nature as well as to the living entities. When the living entity is put into
material nature, then his senses and qualities are polluted, or designated.
There is no possibility for the Supreme Lord to become embodied by
material qualities or material senses for the reason that He is above the
influence of material nature and cannol possibly be putin the darkness of
ignorance like the living entities. Because of His full knowledge, He is


--- Page 326 ---
Text 15] The Movements of the Living Entities 1327
never subjected to the influence of material nature. Material nature is
always under His control, and it is therefore not possible that material
nature can control the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Since the identity of the living entity is very minute, he is prone to
be subjected to material nature, but when he is freed from this material
body, which is false, then he attains the same spiritual nature as the
Supreme Lord. At that time there is no qualitative difference between
him and the Supreme Lord, but because he is not so quantitatively
powerful as to never be put under the influence of material nature, he
is quantitatively different from the Lord.

The entire process of devotional service is to purify oneself of this
contamination of material nature and put oneself on the spiritual platform
where he is qualitatively one with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In
the Vedas it is said that the living entity is always free. Asaingo hy ayari
purusah. The living entity is liberated. His material contamination is
temporary, and his actual position is that he is liberated. This liberation is
achieved by Krsna consciousness, whichbegins from the point of surrender.
Therefore it is said here, “l offer my respectful obeisances unto the
Supreme Person.”

TRANSLATION

The human soul further prays: The living entity is put under the
influence of material nature and continues a hard struggle for existence
on the path of repeated birth and death. This conditional life is due to his
forgetfulness of his relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Therefore, without the Lord’s mercy, how can he again engage in the
transcendental loving service of the Lord?

PURPORT

The Mayavadi philosophers say that simply by cultivation of knowledge
by mental speculation, one can be liberated from the condition of
material bondage. But here it is said one is liberated not by knowledge but
by the mercy of the Supreme Lord. The knowledge the conditioned soul
gains by mental speculation, however powerful it may be, is always too
imperfect to approach the Absolute Truth. It is said that without the
mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead one cannot understand Him
or His actual form, quality and name. Those who are not in devotional
service go on speculating for many, many thousands of years, but they are
still unable to understand the nature of the Absolute Truth.

One can be liberated in the knowledge of Absolute Truth simply by the
mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is clearly said herein that
our memory is lost because we are now covered by His material energy.
Arguments may be put forward as to why we have been put under the
influence of this material energy by the supreme will of the Lord. This is
explained in Bhagavad-gita where the Lord says, “I am sitting in everyone’s
heart, and due to Me one is forgetful or one is alive in knowledge.” The
forgetfulness of the conditioned soul is also due to the direction of the
Supreme Lord. A living entity misuses his little independence when he
wants to lord it over material nature. This misuse of independence, which is
called maya, is always available, otherwise there would be no independence.
Independence implies that one can use it properly or improperly. It is not
static; it is dynamic. Therefore, misuse of independence is the cause of
being influenced by maya.

Maya is so strong that the Lord says that it is very difficult to surmount
her influence. But one can do so very easily “if he surrenders unto Me.”
Mam eva ye prapadyante: anyone who surrenders unto Him can overcome
the influence of the stringent laws of material nature. It is clearly said here
that a living entity is put under the influence of maya by His will, and if
anyone wants to get out of this entanglement, this can be made possible
simply by His mercy.

Text 16] The Movements of the Living Entities 1329
The activities of the conditioned souls under the influence of material
nature are explained here. Every conditioned soul is engaged in different
types of work under the influence of material nature. We can sce in the
material world that the conditioned soul acts so powerfully that he is
playing wonderfully in creating the so-called advancements of material
civilization for sense gratification. But actually his position is to know
that he is an eternal servant of the Supreme Lord. When he is actually in
perfect knowledge, he knows that the Lord is the supreme worshipful
object and that the living entity is His eternal servant. Without this
knowledge, he engages in material activities; that is called ignorance.

inanimate and animate objects. He is present in the three phases of time—
past, present and future. Therefore, the conditioned soul is engaged in
different activities by His direction, and in order to get free from the
threefold miseries of this conditional life, we have to surrender unto Him
only.


--- Page 329 ---
1330 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 31
PURPORT

When a conditioned soul is seriously anxious to get out of the influence
of the material clutches, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is
situated within him as Paramatma, gives him this knowledge: “Surrender
unto Me.” As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita, “Give up all other engage-
ments. Just surrender unto Me.” It is to be accepted that the source of
knowledge is the Supreme Person. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita.
Mattah smrtir jiidnam apohanarh ca. The Lord says, “Through Me one gets
real knowledge and memory, and one also forgets through Me.” To one
who wants to be materially satisfied or who wants to lord it over material
nature, the Lord gives the opportunity to forget His service and engage in
the so-called happiness of material activities. Similarly, when one is
frustrated in lording it over material nature and is very serious
about getting out of this material entanglement, the Lord, from
within, gives him the knowledge that he has to surrender unto Him;
then there is liberation.

This knowledge cannot be imparted by anyone other than the Supreme
Lord or His representative. In the Caitanya-caritamrta Lord Caitanya in-
structs Ripa Gosvami that the living entities wander in life after life, under-
going the miserable conditions of material existence. But when one is very
anxious to get free from the material entanglement, then he gets enlighten-
ment through a spiritual master and Krsna. This means that Krsna as the
Supersoul is seated within the heart of the living entity, and when
the living entity is serious, the Lord directs him to take shelter
of His representative, a bona fide spiritual master. Directed from
within and guided externally by the spiritual master, one attains
the path of Krsna consciousness, which is the way out of the
material clutches.

Therefore there is no possibility of one’s being situated in his own
position unless he is blessed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Unless he is enlightened with the supreme knowledge, one has to undergo
the severe penalties of the hard struggle for existence in the material
nature. The spiritual master is therefore the mercy manifestation of the
Supreme Person. The conditioned soul has to take direct instruction from
the spiritual master, and thus he gradually becomes enlightened to
the path of Krsna consciousness. The seed of Krsna consciousness
is sown within the heart of the conditioned soul, and when one
hears instruction from the spiritual master, the seed fructifies, and
his life is blessed.

Fallen into a pool of blood, stool and urine within the abdomen of his
mother, his own body scorched by the mother’s gastric fire, the embodied
soul, anxious to get out, counts his months and prays, “O my Lord, when
shall I, a wretched soul, be released from this confinement?”’
PURPORT
The precarious condition of the living entity within the womb of his
mother is described here. On one side of where the child is floating there
is the heat of gastric fire, and on the other side there is urine, stool, blood
and discharges. After seven months the child, who has regained his con-
sciousness, feels the horrible condition of his existence and prays to the
Lord. Counting the months until his release, he becomes greatly anxious
to get out of the confinement. The so-called civilized man does not take
account of this horrible condition of life, and sometimes for the purpose
of sense gratification he tries to kill the child by contraceptive methods.


--- Page 331 ---
1332 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 31
Unserious about the horrible condition in the womb, such persons continue
in materialism, grossly misusing the chance of the human form of life.

The word krpapa-dhif is significant in this verse. Dhi means intelligence,
and krpapa means miserly. Conditional life is for persons who are of
miserly intelligence or who do not properly utilize their intelligence. In the
human form of life the intelligence is developed, and one has to utilize that
developed intelligence to get out of the cycle of birth and death. One who
does not do so is a miser, just like a person who has immense wealth but
does not utilize it, keeping it simply to see. A person who doesnot actually
utilize his human intelligence to get out of the clutches of maya, the cycle
of birth and death, is accepted as miserly. The exact opposite of miserly is
udara, very magnanimous. A brahmana is called udara because he utilizes
his human intelligence for spiritual realization. He uses that intelligence to
preach Krsna consciousness for the benefit of the public, and therefore he
is magnanimous.

Text 19] The Movements of the Living Entities 1333
Supreme Personality of Godhead, the friend of all fallen souls, there is no
way to express my gratitude but to pray with folded hands.
PURPORT
As stated in Bhagavad-gita, intelligence and forgetfulness are both
supplied by the Supersoul sitting with the individual soul within the
body. When He sees that a conditioned soul is very serious about getting
out of the clutches of the material influence, the Supreme Lord gives
intelligence internally as Supersoul and externally as the spiritual master,
or, as an incarnation of the Personality of Godhead Himself, He helps by
speaking instructions such as Bhagavad-gita. The Lord is always seeking the
opportunity to reclaim the fallen souls to His abode, the kingdom of God.
We should always feel very much obliged to the Personality of Godhead,
for He is always anxious to bring usinto the happy condition of eternal life.
There is no sufficient means to repay the Personality of Godhead for His
act of benediction; therefore, we can simply feel gratitude and pray to the
Lord with folded hands. This prayer of the child in the womb may be
questioned by some atheistic people. How can a child pray in such a nice
way in the womb of his mother? Everything is possible by the grace of the
Lord. The child is put into such a precarious condition externally, but
internally he is the same, and the Lord is there. By the transcendental
energy of the Lord, everything is possible.

TRANSLATION

The living entity in another type of body sees only by instinct; he knows
only the agreeable and disagreeable sense perceptions of that particular
body. But I have a body in which I can control my senses and can
understand my destination; therefore, I offer my respectful obeisances to
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by whom I have been blessed with
this body, and by whose grace I can see Him within and without.

PURPORT

The evolutionary process of different types of bodies is something like
that of a fructifying flower. Just as there are different stages in the growth
of a flower—the bud stage, the blooming stage and the full-fledged, grown-
up stage of aroma and beauty—similarly, there are 8,400,000 species of
bodies in gradual evolution, and there is systematic progress from the low-
er species of life to the higher. The human form of life is supposed to be
the highest, for it offers consciousness for getting out of the clutches of
birth and death. The fortunate child in the womb of his mother realizes his
superior position and is thereby distinguished from other bodies. Animals
in bodies lower than that of the human being are conscious only as far as
their bodily distress and happiness are concerned; they cannot think of
more than their bodily necessities of life—eating, sleeping, mating and de-
fending. But in the human form of life, by the grace of God, the
consciousness is so developed that a man can evaluate his exceptional
position and thus realize the self and the Supreme Lord.

The word dama-$ariri means that we have a body in which we can
control the senses and the mind. The complication of materialistic life is
due to an uncontrolled mind and uncontrolled senses. One should feel
grateful to the Supreme Personality of Godhead for having obtained such
a nice human form of body, and he should properly utilize it. The
distinction between an animal and a man is that the animal cannot control
himself and has no sense of decency, whereas the human being has the
sense of decency and can control himself. If this controlling power is not
exhibited by the human being, then he is no better than an animal. By
controlling the senses, or by the process of yoga regulation, one can under-


--- Page 334 ---
Text 20] The Movements of the Living Entities 1335
stand the position of his self, the Supersoul, the world and their interrela-
tion; everything is possible by controlling the senses. Otherwise, we are no
better than animals.

Real self-realization by means of controlling the senses is explained
herein. One should try to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead and
his own self also. To think oneself the same as the Supreme is not self-
realization. Here it is clearly explained that the Supreme Lord is anadi, or
purana, and He has no other cause. The living entity is born of the
Supreme Godhead as part and parcel. It is confirmed in the Brahma-
sarhhita, anadir adir govindah: Govinda, the Supreme Person, has no cause.
He is unborn. But the living entity is born of Him. As confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita, mamaivamsah: both the living entity and the Supreme Lord
are unborn, but it has to be understood that the supreme cause of the
part and parcel is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Brahma-sarhhita
therefore says that everything has come from the Supreme Personality of
Godhead (sarva-karana-karanam). The Vedanta-sittra confirms this also.
Janmady asya yatah: the Absolute Truth is the original source of every-
one’s birth. Krsna also says in Bhagavad-gita, aharh sarvasya prabhavah: “1
am the source of birth of everything, including Brahma and Lord Siva and
the living entities.” This is self-realization. One should know that he is
under the control of the Supreme Lord and not think that he is fully
independent. Otherwise, why should he be put into conditional life?

TRANSLATION

Therefore, my Lord, although I am living in a terrible condition, still I
do not wish to depart from my mother’s abdomen to fall again into the
blind well of materialistic life. Your external energy, called deva-maya, at
once captures the newly born child, and immediately false identification,
which is the beginning of the cycle of continual birth and death, begins.

PURPORT

As long as the child is within the womb of his mother, he is in a very
precarious and horrible condition of life, but the benefit is that he revives
pure consciousness of his relationship with the Supreme Lord and prays
for deliverance. But once he is outside the abdomen, when a child is born,
maya or the illusory energy is so strong that he is immediately overpowered
into considering his body to be his self. Maya means illusion, or that which
is actually not. In the material world, everyone is identifying with his
body. This false egoistic consciousness of ^] am this body” at once
develops after the child comes out of the womb. The mother and other
relatives are awaiting the child, and as soon as he is born, the mother feeds
him, and everyone takes care of him. The living entity soon forgets his po-
sition and becomes entangled in bodily relationships. The entire material
existence is entanglement in this bodily conception of life. Real knowledge
means to develop the consciousness of “I am not this body. I am spirit
soul, an eternal part and parcel of the Supreme Lord.” Real knowledge
entails renunciation, or nonacceptance of this body as the self.

By the influence of maya, the external energy, one forgets everything
just after birth. Therefore the child is praying that he prefers to remain
within the womb rather than come out. It is said that Sukadeva Gosvami,
on this consideration, remained for sixteen years within the womb of his
mother; he did not want to be entangled in false bodily identification.
After cultivating such knowledge within the womb of his mother, he came
out at the end of sixteen years and immediately left home so that he
might not be captured by the influence of maya. The influence of maya is
also explained in Bhagavad-gitd as insurmountable. But insurmountable
mayd can be overcome simply by Krsna consciousness. That is also


--- Page 336 ---
Text 21] The Movements of the Living Entities 1337
confirmed in Bhagavad-gita. Mam eva ye prapadyante mayam etam taranti
te (Bg. 7.14): whoever surrenders unto the lotus feet of Krsna can get out
of this false conception of life. By the influence of maya only, one forgets
his eternal relationship with Krsna and identifies himself with his body
and the by-products of the body—namely wife, children, society, friend-
ship and love. Thus he becomes a victim of the influence of maya, and his
materialistic life of continued birth and death becomes still more stringent.

PURPORT
The miseries of material existence begin from the very day when the
spirit soul takes shelter in the ovum and sperm of the mother and father,


--- Page 337 ---
1338 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 31
they continue after he is born from the womb, and then they are further
prolonged. We do not know where the suffering ends. It does not end,
however, by one’s changing his body. The change of body is taking place
at every moment, but that does not mean that we are improving from the
fetal condition of life to a more comfortable condition. The best thing is,
therefore, to develop Krsna consciousness. Here it is stated, upasadita-
vispu-padah. This means realization of Krsna consciousness. One who is
intelligent, by the grace of the Lord, and develops Krsna consciousness, is
successful in his life because simply by keeping himself in Krsna conscious-
ness, he will be saved from the repetition of birth and death.

The child prays that it is better to remain within the womb of darkness
and be constantly absorbed in Krsna consciousness than to get out and
again fall a victim to the illusory energy. The illusory energy acts within
the abdomen as well as outside the abdomen, but the trick is that one
should remain Krsna conscious, and then the effect of such a horrible
condition cannot act unfavorably upon him. In Bhagavad-gita it is said that
one’s intelligence is his friend and the same intelligence can also be his
enemy. Here also the same idea is repeated: suhrdatmanaiva, friendly
intelligence. Absorption of intelligence in the personal service of Krsna
and full consciousness of Krsna always are the path of self-realization and
liberation. Without being unnecessarily agitated, if we take to the process
of Krsna consciousness by constantly chanting Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna,
Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare,
the cycle of birth and death can be stopped for good.

It may be questioned herein how the child can be fully Krsna conscious
within the womb of the mother without any paraphernalia with which to
execute Krsna consciousness. It is not necessary to arrange for parapher-
nalia to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu. The child
wants to remain within the abdomen of its mother and at the same time
wants to become free from the clutches of maya. One does not need any
material arrangement to cultivate Krsna consciousness. One can cultivate
Krsna consciousness anywhere and everywhere, provided he can always
think of Krsna. The maha-mantra, Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna,
Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, can be
chanted even within the abdomen of one’s mother. One can chant while
sleeping, while working, while imprisoned in the womb or while outside.
This Krsna consciousness cannot be checked in any circumstance. The
conclusion of the child’s prayer is: “Let me remain in this condition;
although it is very miserable, it is better not to fall a victim to maya
again by going outside.”

Pushed downward all of a sudden by the wind, the child comes out
with great trouble, head downward, breathless and deprived of memory
due to severe agony.
PURPORT
The word 17001807600 means “with great difficulty.” When the child
comes out of the abdomen through the narrow passage, due to pressure
there the breathing system completely stops, and due to agony the child
loses his memory. Sometimes the trouble is so severe that the child comes
out dead or almost dead. One can imagine what the pangs of birth are
like. The child remains for ten months in that horrible condition within
the abdomen, and at the end of ten months he is forcibly pushed out. In
Bhagavad-gita the Lord points out that a person who is serious about
advancement in spiritual consciousness should always consider the four
pangs of birth, death, disease and old age. The materialist advances in
many ways, but he is unable to stop these four principles of suffering
inherent in material existence.

After coming out of the abdomen, the child is given to the care of
persons who are unable to understand what he wants, and thus he is
nursed by such persons. Unable to refuse whatever is given to him, he falls
into undesirable circumstances.
PURPORT
Within the abdomen of the mother, the nourishment of the child was
being carried on by nature’s own arrangement. Although the atmosphere
within the abdomen was not at all pleasing, still, as far as the child’s
feeding was concerned, it was being properly done by the laws of nature.
But upon coming out of the abdomen the child falls into a different
atmosphere. He wants to eat one thing, but something else is given to him
because no one knows his actual demand, and he cannot refuse the
undesirables given to him. Sometimes the child cries for the mother’s
breast, but because the nurse thinks that it is due to pain within his
stomach that he is crying, she supplies him some bitter medicine. The
child does not want it, but he cannot refuse it. He is put in very awkward
circumstances, and the suffering continues.

for his relief.

Text 28] The Movements of the Living Entities 1343
PURPORT
The word vigata-jianam means that the spiritual knowledge which the
child developed in the abdomen is already lost to the spell of maya. Owing
to various kinds of disturbances and to being out of the abdomen, the
child cannot remember what he was thinking of for his salvation. 1t is
assumed that even if a person acquires some spiritually uplifting knowledge,
circumstantially he is prone to forget it. Not only children but also elderly
persons should be very careful to protect their sense of Krsna conscious-
ness and avoid unfavorable circumstances so that they may not forget
their prime duty.

TRANSLATION
In this way, the child passes through his childhood, suffering different
kinds of distresses, and he attains boyhood. In boyhood also he suffers
pain over desires to get things which he can never achieve. And thus, due
to ignorance, he becomes angry and sorry.
PURPORT
From birth to the end of five years of age is called childhood. After five
years up to the end of the fifteenth year is called pauganda. At sixteen
years of age, youth begins. The distresses of childhood are already
explained, but when the child attains boyhood he is enrolled in a school
which he does not like. He wants to play, but he is forced to go to school
and study and take responsibility for passing examinations. Another kind
of distress is that he wants to get some things with which to play, but


--- Page 343 ---
1344 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 31
circumstances may be such that he is not able to attain them, and he thus
becomes aggrieved and feels pain. In one word, he is unhappy, even in his
boyhood, just as he was unhappy in his childhood, what to speak of youth.
Boys are apt to create so many artificial demands for playing, and when
they do not attain satisfaction they become furious with anger, and the
result is suffering.

With the growth of the body, the living entity, in order to vanquish his
soul, increases his false prestige and anger and thereby creates enmity
towards similarly lusty people.
PURPORT
In Bhagavad-gita, Third Chapter, thirty-sixth verse, Arjuna inquired
from Krsna about the cause of a living being’s lust. It is said that a living
entity is eternal and, as such, qualitatively one with the Supreme Lord.
Then what is the reason that he falls prey to the material and commits so
many sinful activities by the influence of the material energy? In reply to
this question, Lord Krsna said that it is lust which causes a living entity to
glide down from his exalted position to the abominable condition of
material existence. This lust circumstantially changes into anger. Both lust
and anger stand on the platform of the mode of passion. Lust is actually
the product of the mode of passion, and in the absence of satisfaction of
lust, the same desire transforms into anger on the platform of ignorance.


--- Page 344 ---
Text 30] The Movements of the Living Entities 1345
When ignorance covers the soul, it is the source of his degradation to the
most abominable condition of hellish life.

To raise oneself from hellish life to the highest position of spiritual
understanding is to transform this lust into love of Krsna. Sri Narottama
dasa Thakura, a great acarya of the ४ ३१६१३९३ sampradaya, said, kama krsna-
karmarpane: due to our lust we want many things for our sense gratifica-
tion, but the same lust can be transformed in a purified way so that we
want everything for the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of God-
head. Anger also can be utilized towards a person who is atheistic or who
is envious of the Personality of Godhead. As we have fallen in this material
existence because of our lust and anger, the same two qualities can be
utilized for the purpose of advancing in Krsna consciousness, and one can
elevate himself again to his former pure spiritual position. Srila Ripa
Gosvami has therefore recommended that because in material existence
we have so many objects of sense gratification, which we need for the
maintenance of the body, we should use all of them without attachment,
for the purpose of satisfying the senses of Krsna; that is actual renunciation.

--- Page 345 ---
1346 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 31
PURPORT
The expansion of ignorance is explained in this verse. The first ignorance
is to identify one’s material body, which is made of five elements, as the
self, and the second is to accept something as one’s own due to a bodily
connection. In this way ignorance expands. The living entity is eternal,
but because of his accepting nonpermanent things, misidentifying his in-
terest, he is put into ignorance, and therefore he suffers material pangs.

For the sake of the body, which is a source of constant trouble to him
and which follows him because he is bound by ties of ignorance and
fruitive activities, he performs various actions which cause him to be
subjected to repeated birth and death.
PURPORT
In Bhagavad-gita it is said that one has to work to satisfy Yajfia, or
Visnu, for any work done without the purpose of satisfying the Supreme
Personality of Godhead is a cause of bondage. In the conditioned state a
living entity, accepting his body as himself, forgets his eternal relationship
with the Supreme Personality of Godhead and acts on the interest of his
body. lle takes the body as himself, his bodily expansions as his kinsmen


--- Page 346 ---
Text 32] The Movements of the Living Entities 1347
and the land from which his body is born as worshipable. In this way he
performs all sorts of misconceived activities, which lead to his perpetual
bondage in repetition of birth and death in various species.

In modern civilization, the so-called social, national and government
leaders mislead people more and more, under the bodily conception of life,
with the result that all the leaders, with their followers, are gliding down
to hellish conditions birth after birth. An example is given in Srimad-
Bhagavatam. Andha yathandhair upaniyamdanah: when a blind man leads
several other blind men, the result is that all of them fall down in a ditch.
This is actually happening. There are many leaders to lead the ignorant
public, but because every one of them is bewildered by the bodily concep-
tion of life, there is no peace and prosperity in human society. So-called
yogis who perform various bodily feats are also in the same category as
such ignorant people because the hatha-yoga system is especially recom-
mended for persons who are grossly implicated in the bodily conception.
The conclusion is that as long as one is fixed in the bodily conception, he
has to suffer birth and death.

goes to hell as before.


--- Page 347 ---
1348 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 31
PURPORT

It has been explained that the conditioned soul is put into the Andha-
tamisra and Tamisra hellish conditions, and after suffering there he gets a
hellish body like the dog’s or hog’s. After several such births, he again
comes into the form of a human being. How the human being is born is
also described by Kapiladeva. The human being develops in the mother’s
abdomen and suffers there and comes out again. After all these sufferings,
if he gets another chance in a human body and wastes his valuable time in
the association of personswho are concerned with sexual life and palatable
dishes, then naturally he again glides down to the same Andha-tamisra and
Tamisra hells.

Generally, people are concerned with the satisfaction of the tongue and
the satisfaction of the genitals. That is material life. Material life means eat,
drink, be merry and enjoy, with no concern for understanding one’s spiritual
identity and the process of spiritual advancement. Since materialistic people
are concerned with the tongue, belly and genitals, if anyone wants to advance
in spiritual life he must be very careful about associating with such people.
To associate with such materialistic men is to commit purposeful suicide in
the human form of life. It is said, therefore, that an intelligent man should
give up such undesirable association and should always mix with saintly
persons. When he is in association with saintly persons, all his doubts about
the spiritual expansion of life are eradicated, and he makes tangible progress
on the path of spiritual understanding. 1! is also sometimes found that
people are very much addicted to a particular type of religious faith.
Hindus, Muslims and Christians are faithful in their particular type of
religion, and they go to the church, temple or mosque, but unfortunately
they cannot give up the association of persons who are too much addicted
to sex life and satisfaction of the palate. Here it is clearly said that one may
officially be a very religious man, but if he associates with such persons,
then he is sure to slide down to the darkest region of hell.

He becomes devoid of truthfulness, cleanliness, mercy, gravity, spiritual

control of the senses, fortune and all such opportunities.

PURPORT

Those who are too addicted to sex life cannot understand the purpose
of the Absolute Truth, nor can they be clean in their habits, not to
mention showing mercy to others. They cannot remain grave, and they
have no interest in the ultimate goal of life. The ultimate goal of life is
Krsna, or Visnu, but those who are addicted to sex life cannot understand
that their ultimate interest is Krsna consciousness. Such people have no
sense of decency, and even in public streets or public parks they embrace
each other just like cats and dogs and pass it off in the name of love-
making. Such unfortunate creatures can never become materially prosper-
ous. Behavior like that of cats and dogs keeps them in the position of cats
and dogs. They cannot improve any material condition, not to speak of
becoming famous. Such foolish persons may even make a show of so-called
yoga, but they are unable to control the senses and mind, which is the real
purpose of yoga practice. Such people can have no opulence in their lives.
In a word, they are very unfortunate.

TRANSLATION
One should not associate with a coarse fool who is bereft of the
knowledge of self-realization and who is no more than a dancing dog in
the hands of a woman.
PURPORT
The restriction of association with such foolish persons is especially
meant for those who are in the line of advancement in Krsna conscious-
ness. Advancement in Krsna consciousness involves developing the qualities
of truthfulness, cleanliness, mercy, gravity, intelligence in spiritual knowl-
edge, simplicily, material opulence, fame, forgiveness, and control of the
mind and the senses. All these qualities are to be manifested with the
progress of Krsna consciousness, but if one associates with a Sidra, a
foolish person who is like a dancing dog in the hands of a woman, then he
cannot make any progress. Lord Cailanya has advised thal any person
who is engaged in Krsna consciousness and who desires to pass beyond
material nescience must not associate himself with women or with persons
interested in material enjoyment. For a person seeking advancement in
Krsna consciousness, such association is more dangerous than suicide.

TRANSLATION

The infatuation and bondage which accrue to a man from attachment
to any other object is not as complete as that resulting from attachment
to a woman or to the fellowship of men who are fond of women.

PURPORT

Attachment to women is so contaminating that one becomes attached
to the condition of material life not only by the association of women but
by the contaminated association of persons who are too attached to them.
There are many reasons for our conditional life in the material world, but
the topmost of all such causes is the association of women, as will be
confirmed in the following stanzas.

In Kali-yuga, association with women is very strong. In every step of
life, there is association with women. If a person goes to purchase some-
thing, the advertisements are full of pictures of women. The physiological
attraction for women is very great, and therefore people are very slack in
spiritual understanding. The Vedic civilization, being based on spiritual
understanding, arranges association with women very cautiously. Out of
the four social divisions, the members of the first order, namely brahma-
carya, the third order, vanaprastha, and the fourth order, sannyasa, are
strictly prohibited from female association. Only in one order, the house-
holder, is there license to mix with women under restricted conditions.
In other words, attraction for woman’s association is the cause of the
material conditional life, and anyone interested in being freed from this
conditional life must detach himself from the association of women.

TRANSLATION
At the sight of his own daughter, Brahma was bewildered by her charms
and shamelessly ran up to her in the form of a stag when she took the
form of a hind.
PURPORT
Lord Brahma’s being captivated by the charms of his daughter and Lord
Siva’s being captivated by the Mohini form of the Lord are specific
instances which instruct us that even great demigods like Brahma and
Lord Siva, what to speak of the ordinary conditioned soul, are captivated
by the beauty of woman. Therefore, everyone is advised that one should
not freely mix even with one’s daughter, or with his mother, or with his
sister, because the senses are so strong that when one becomes infatuated,
the senses do not consider the relationship of daughter, mother or sister.
It is best, therefore, to practice controlling the senses by performing
bhakti-yoga, engaging in the service of Madana-mohana. Lord Krsna’s
name is Madana-mohana, for He can subdue the god Cupid, or lust. Only
by engaging in the service of Madana-mohana can one curb the dictates of
Madana, Cupid. Otherwise, attempts to control the senses will fail.

TRANSLATION
Amongst all kinds of living entities begotten by Brahma, namely men,
demigods, and animals, none but the sage Narayana is immune to the
attraction of maya in the form of woman.
PURPORT
The first living creature is Brahma himself, and from him were created
sages like Marici, who in their turn created Kasyapa Muni and others, and
Kasyapa Muni and the Manus created different demigods and human
beings, etc. But there is none among them who is not attracted by the
spell of maya in the form of woman. Throughout the entire material
world, beginning from Brahma down to the small insignificant creatures
like the ant, everyone is attracted by sex life. That is the basic principle of
this material world. Lord Brahma’s being attracted by his daughter is the
vivid example that no one is exempt from sexual attraction to woman.
Woman, therefore, is the wonderful creation of maya to keep the con-
ditioned soul in shackles.

--- Page 353 ---
1354 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 31
PURPORT

There are many instances in the history of the world of a great
conqueror’s being captivated by the charms of a Cleopatra. One has to
study the captivating potency of woman, and man’s attraction for
that potency. From what source was this generated? According to
Vedanta-sutra, we can understand that everything is generated from the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is enunciated there, janmady asya
yatah. This means that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or the
Supreme Person, Brahman, the Absolute Truth, is the source from whom
everything emanates. The captivating power of woman, and man’s suscep-
tibility to such attraction, must also exist in the Supreme Personality of
Godhead in the spiritual world and must be represented in the transcen-
dental pastimes of the Lord.

The Lord is the Supreme Person, the supreme male. As a common male
wants to be attracted by a female, similarly, that propensity is in the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. He also wants to be attracted by the
beautiful features of a woman. Now the question is, if He wants to be
captivated by such womanly attraction, would He be attracted by any
material woman? It is not possible. Even persons who are in this material
existence can give up womanly attraction if they are attracted by the
Supreme Brahman. Such was the case with Haridasa Thakura. A beautiful
prostitute tried to attract him in the dead of night, but since he was
situated in devotional service, in transcendental love of Godhead, Haridasa
Thakura was not captivated. Rather, he turned the prostitute into a great
devotee by his transcendental association. This material attraction, there-
fore, certainly cannot attract the Supreme Lord. When He wants to be
attracted by a woman, He has to create such a woman from His own
energy. That woman is Radharani. It is explained by the Gosvamis that
Radharani is the manifestation of the pleasure potency of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. When the Supreme Lord wants to derive transcen-
dental pleasure, He has to create a woman from His internal potency. Thus
the tendency to be attracted by womanly beauty is natural because it
exists in the spiritual world. In the material world it is reflected per-
vertedly, and therefore there are so many inebrieties.

Instead of being attracted by material beauty, if one is accustomed to
be attracted by the beauty of Radharani and Krsna, then the statement in
Bhagavad-gita, param drstva nivartate, holds true. When one is attracted by
the transcendental beauty of Radha and Krsna, he is no longer attracted
by material feminine beauty. That is the special significance of Radha-


--- Page 354 ---
Text 39] The Movements of the Living Entities 1355
Krsna worship. That is testified to by Yamunacarya. He says, “Since I have
become attracted by the beauty of Radha and Krsna, when there is attrac-
tion for a woman or a memory of sex life with a woman, I at once spit on
it,and my face turns in disgust.” When we are attracted by Madana-mohana
and the beauty of Krsna and His consorts, then the shackles of conditioned
life, namely the beauty of a material woman, cannot attract us.

TRANSLATION
One who aspires to reach the culmination of yoga and has realized his
self by rendering service unto Me should never associate with an attractive
woman, for such a woman is declared in the scripture to be the gateway
to hell for the advancing devotee.
PURPORT
The culmination of yoga is full Krsna consciousness. This is affirmed in
Bhagavad-gita: a person who is always thinking of Krsna in devotion is the
topmost of all yogis. And in the Second Chapter of the First Canto of
Srimad-Bhagavatam, it is also stated that when one becomes freed from


--- Page 355 ---
1356 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 31
material contamination by rendering devotional service unto the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, he can at that time understand the science of
God.

Here the word pratilabdhatma-labhah occurs. Atma means self, and labha
means gain. Generally, conditioned souls have lost their atma, or self, but
those who are transcendentalists have realized the self. It is directed that
such a self-realized soul who aspires to the topmost platform of yogic
perfection should not associate with young women. In the modern age,
however, there are so many rascals who recommend that while one has
genitals he should enjoy women as much as he likes, and at the same time
he can become a yogi. In no standard yoga system is the association of
women accepted. It is clearly stated here that the association of women is
the gateway to hellish life. The association of woman is very much
restricted in the Vedic civilization. Out of the four social divisions, the
brahmacari, vanaprastha and the sannyasi, three orders, are strictly pro-
hibited from the association of women; only the grhasthas, or house-
holders, are given license to have an intimate relationship with a woman,
and that relationship is also restricted for begetting nice children. If,
however, one wants to stick to continued existence in the material world,
he may indulge in female association unrestrictedly.

who associates with such maya by accepting services must certainly know
that this is the way of death, just like a blind well covered with grass.


--- Page 356 ---
Text 41] The Movements of the Living Entities 1357
PURPORT
Sometimes it happens that a rejected well is covered by grass, and an
unwary traveler who does not know of the existence of the well falls
down, and his death is assured. Similarly, association with a woman
begins when one accepts service from her because woman is especially
created by the Lord to give service to man. By accepting her service, a
man is entrapped. If he is not intelligent enough to know that she is the
gateway to hellish life, he may indulge in her association very liberally. This
is restricted for those who aspire to ascend to the transcendental platform.
Even fifty years ago in Hindu society, such association was restricted. A
wife could not see her husband during the daytime. Householders even had
different residential quarters. The internal quarters of a residential house
were for the woman, and the external quarters were for the man. Accep-
tance of service rendered by a woman may appear to be very pleasing, but
one should be very cautious in accepting such service because it is clearly
said that woman is the gateway to death, or forgetfulness of one’s self.
She blocks the path of spiritual realization.

life, has been endowed with the form of a woman, foolishly looks upon
maya in the form of a man, her husband, as the bestower of wealth,
progeny, house and other material assets.

1358 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 31
PURPORT

From this verse it appears that a woman is also supposed to have been a
man in his (her) previous life, and due to his attachment to his wife, he now
has the body of a woman. Bhagavad-gita confirms this; a man gets his next
life’s birth according to what he thinks of at the time of death. If someone
is too attached to his wife, naturally he thinks of his wife at the time of
death, and in his next life he takes the body of a woman. Similarly, if a
woman thinks of her husband at the time of death, then naturally she gets
the body of a man in the next life. In the Hindu scriptures, therefore,
woman’s chastity and devotion to man is greatly emphasized. A woman’s
attachment to her husband may elevate her to the body of a man in her
next life, but a man’s attachment to a woman will degrade him, and in his
next life he will get the body of a woman. We should always remember, as
it is stated in Bhagavad-gita, that both the gross and subtle material bodies
are dresses; they are the shirt and coat of the living entity. To be either a
woman or a man only involves one’s bodily dress. The soul in nature is
actually the marginal energy of the Supreme Lord. Every living entity,
being classified as energy, is supposed to be originally a woman, or one
who is enjoyed. In the body of a man there is a greater opportunity to get
out of the material clutches; there is less opportunity in the body of a
woman. In this verse it is indicated that the body of a man should not be
misused through forming an attachment to women and thus becoming too
entangled in material enjoyment, which will result in getting the body of a
woman in the next life. A woman is generally fond of household prosperity,
ornaments, furniture and dresses. She is satisfied when the husband supplies
all these things sufficiently. The relationship between man and woman is
very complicated, but the substance is that one who aspires to ascend to
the transcendental stage of spiritual realization should be very careful in
accepting the association of a woman. In the stage of Krsna consciousness,
however, such restriction of association may be slackened because if a
man’s and woman’s attachment is not to each other but to Krsna, then
both of them are equally eligible to get out of the material entanglement
and reach the abode of Krsna. As it is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita, anyone
who seriously takes to Krsna consciousness—whether in the lowest species
of life, or a woman, or of the less intelligent classes, such as the mercantile
or laborer class—will go back home, back to Godhead, and reach the abode
of Krsna. A man should not be attached to a woman, nor should a woman
be attached to a man. Both man and woman should be attached to the
service of the Lord. Then there is the possibility of liberation from material
entanglement for both of them.

TRANSLATION
A woman, therefore, should consider her husband, her house and her
children to be the arrangement of the external energy of the Lord for her
death, just as the sweet singing of the hunter is death for the deer.
PURPORT
In these instructions of Lord Kapiladeva it is explained that not only
is woman the gateway to hell for man, but man is also the gateway to hell
for woman. It is a question of attachment. A man becomes attached to a
woman because of her service, her beauty and many other assets, and
similarly, a woman becomes attached to a man for his giving her a nice
place to live, ornaments, dress and children. It is a question of attachment
for one another. As long as either is attached to the other for such
material enjoyment, the woman is dangerous for the man, and the man is
also dangerous for the woman. But if the attachment is transferred to
Krsna, both of them become Krsna conscious, and then marriage is
very nice. Srila Riipa Gosvami therefore recommends:
andsaktasya visayan
yathdrtham upayuiijatah
nirbandhah krsna-sambandhe

(Bh.rs. 1.2.255)


--- Page 359 ---
1360 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 31
Man and woman should live together as householders in relationship with
Krsna only for the purpose of discharging duties in the service of Krsna.
Engage the children, engage the wife and engage the husband, all in Krsna
conscious duties, and then all these bodily or material attachments will
disappear. Since the via medium is Krsna, the consciousness is pure, and
there is no possibility of degradation at any time.

TRANSLATION
Due to his particular type of body, the materialistic living entity
wanders from one planet to another, following fruitive activities. In this
way, he involves himself in fruitive activities and enjoys the result
incessantly.
PURPORT
When the living entity is encaged in the material body, he is called jiva-
bhuta, and when he is free from the material body he is called brahma-
bhita. By changing his material body birth after birth, he travels not only
in the different species of life, but also from one planet to another. Lord
Caitanya says that the living entities, bound up by fruitive activities, are
wandering in this way throughout the whole universe, and if by some
chance or by pious activities they get in touch with a bona fide spiritual
master, by the grace of Krsna, then they get the seed of devotional service.
After getting this seed, if one sows it within his heart and pours water on it
by hearing and chanting, the seed grows into a big plant, and there are


--- Page 360 ---
Text 44] The Movements of the Living Entities 1361
fruits and flowers which the living entity can enjoy, even in this material
world. That is called the brahma-bhiita stage. In his designated condition,
a living entity is called materialistic, and upon being freed from all
designation, when he is fully Krsna conscious, engaged in devotional
service, he is called liberated. Unless one gets the opportunity to associate
with a bona fide spiritual master by the grace of the Lord, there is no
possibility of one’s liberation from the cycle of birth and death in the
different species of life and through the different grades of planets.

TRANSLATION

In this way the living entity gets a suitable body with a material mind
and senses, according to his fruitive activities. When the reaction of his
particular activity is finished, it is called death, and when a particular
type of reaction begins, that is called birth.

PURPORT

From time immemorial, the living entity travels in the different species
of life and the different planets, almost perpetually. This process is ex-
plained in Bhagavad-gita. Bhramayan sarva-bhutani yantraridhani mayaya:
under the spell of maya, everyone is wandering throughout the universe on
the carriage of the body offered by the material energy. Materialistic life in-
volves a series of actions and reactions. It is a long film spool of actions and
reactions, and one life span is just a flash in such a reactionary show. When


--- Page 361 ---
1362 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 31
a child is born, it is to be understood that his particular type of body is
the beginning of another set of activities, and when an old man dies, it is
to be understood that one set of reactionary activity is finished.

We can see that, because of different reactionary activities, one man is
born in a rich family, and another is born in a poor family, although both
of them are born in the same place, in the same moment and the same
atmosphere. One who is carrying pious activity with him is given a chance
to take his birth in a rich or pious family, and one who is carrying impious
activity is given a chance to take birth in a lower, poor family. The change
of body means a change to a different field of activities. Similarly, when
the body of the boy changes into that of a youth, the boyish activities
change into youthful activities.

It is clear that a particular body is given to the living entity for a
particular type of activity. This process is going on perpetually, from a time
which is impossible to trace out. Vaisnava poets say, therefore, anadi
karama-phale, which means that these actions and reactions of one’s activity
cannot be traced, for they may even continue from the last millennium of
Brahma’s birth to the next millennium. We have seen the example in the
life of Narada Muni. In one millennium he was the son of a maidservant,
and in the next millennium he became a great sage.

indeed; caksusah—of the sense of sight; drastuh— of the seer; drastrtva— of
the faculty of seeing; ayogyata—incapability; anayoh—of both of these.

TRANSLATION

When the eyes lose their power to see color or form due to morbid
affliction of the optic nerve, the sense of sight becomes deadened. The
living entity, who is the seer of both the eyes and the sight, loses his
power of vision. In the same way, when the physical body, the place where
perception of objects occurs, is rendered incapable of perceiving, that is
known as death. When one begins to view the physical body as one’s very
self, that is called birth.

PURPORT

When one says, “I see,” this means that he sees with his eyes or with his
spectacles; he sees with the instrument of sight. If the instrument of sight
is broken or becomes diseased or incapable of acting, then he, as the seer,
also ceases to act. Similarly, in this material body, at the present moment
the living soul is acting, and when the material body, due to its incapability
to function, ceases, he also ceases to perform his reactionary activities.
When one’s instrument of action is broken and cannot function, that is
called death. Again, when one gets a new instrument for action, that is
called birth. This process of birth and death is going on at every moment,
by constant bodily change. The final change is called death, and acceptance
of a new body is called birth. That is the solution of the question of birth
and death. Actually, the living entity has neither birth nor death, but is
eternal. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita, na hanyate hanyamane $arire: the
living entity never dies, even after the death or annihilation of this material
body.

TRANSLATION

Therefore, one should not view death with horror, nor have recourse to
defining the body as soul, nor give way to exaggeration in enjoying the
bodily necessities of life. Realizing the true nature of the living entity, one
should move about in the world free from attachment and steadfast in
purpose.

PURPORT

A sane person who has understood the philosophy of life and death is
very upset upon hearing of the horrible, hellish condition of life in the
womb of the mother or outside of the mother. But one has to make a
solution to the problems of life. A sane man should understand the
miserable condition of this material body. Without being unnecessarily
upset, he should try to find out if there is a remedy. The remedial measures
can be understood when one associates with persons who are liberated. It
must be understood who is actually liberated. The liberated person is
described in Bhagavad-gita: one who engages in uninterrupted devotional
service to the Lord, having surpassed the stringent laws of material
nature, is understood to be situated in Brahman.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is beyond the material creation.
It is admitted even by impersonalists like Sankaracarya that Narayana is
transcendental to this material creation. As such, when one actually engages
in the service of the Lord in various forms, either Narayana, or Radha-
Krsna, or Sita-Rama, he is understood to be on the platform of liberation.
The Bhagavatam also confirms that liberation means to be situated in one’s
constitutional position. Since a living entity is eternally the servitor of the
Supreme Lord, when one seriously and sincerely engages in the transcen-
dental loving service of the Lord, that is the position of liberation. One


--- Page 364 ---
Text 48] The Movements of the Living Entities 1365
should try to associate with a liberated person, and then the problems of
life, namely birth and death, can be solved.

While discharging devotional service in full Krsna consciousness, one
should not be miserly. He should not unnecessarily show that he has
renounced this world. Actually, renunciation is not possible. If one
renounces his palatial building and goes to a forest, there is actually no
renunciation because the palatial building is the property of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead and the forest is also the property of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. If he changes from one property to another, that
does not mean that he renounces; he was never the proprietor of either the
palace or the forest. Renunciation necessitates renouncing the false under-
standing that one can lord it over material nature. When one renounces this
false attitude and renounces the puffed up position that he is also God, that
is real renunciation. Otherwise, there is no meaning of renunciation. Ripa
Gosvami advises that if one renounces anything which could be applied in
the service of the Lord and does not use it for that purpose, that is called
phalgu-vairagya, insufficient or false renunciation. Everything belongs to
the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore everything can be engaged
in the service of the Lord; nothing should be used for one’s sense gratifi-
cation. That is real renunciation. Nor should one unnecessarily increase
the necessities of the body. We should be satisfied with whatever is offered
and supplied by Krsna without much personal endeavor. We should spend
our time executing devotional service in Krsna consciousness. That is the
solution of the problem of life and death.

TRANSLATION

Endowed with right vision and strengthened by devotional service and a
pessimistic attitude toward material identity, one should relegate his body
to this illusory world through his reason. Thus one can be unconcerned
with this material world.

PURPORT

It is sometimes misunderstood that if one has to associate with persons
engaged in devotional service, he will not be able to solve the economic
problem. To answer this argument, it is described here that one has to
associate with liberated persons not directly, physically, but by under-
standing, through philosophy and logic, the problems of life. It is stated
here, samyag- darsanaya buddhya: one has to see perfectly, and by
intelligence and yoga practice one has to renounce this world. That
renunciation can be achieved by the process recommended in the Second
Chapter of the First Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam.

The devotee’s intelligence is always in touch with the Supreme Person-
ality of Godhead. His attitude toward the material existence is one of
detachment, for he knows perfectly well that this material world is a
creation of illusory energy. Realizing himself to be part and parcel of the
Supreme Soul, the devotee discharges his devotional service and is com-
pletely aloof from material action and reaction. Thus at the end he gives
up his material body or the material energy, and as pure soul he enters
the kingdom of God.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Third Canto, Thirty-first
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “Lord Kapila’s Instructions
on the Movements of the Living Entities.”

The Personality of Godhead said: The person who lives in the center of
household life derives material benefits by performing religious rituals, and
thereby he fulfills his desire for economic development and sense
gratification. Again and again he acts the same way.
PURPORT
There are two kinds of householders. One is called the grhamedhi, and
the other is called the grhastha. The objective of the grhamedhi is sense
1367


--- Page 367 ---
1368 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 32
gratification, and the objective of the grhastha is self-realization. Here the
Lord is speaking about the grhamedh, or the person who wants to remain
in this material world. His activity is to enjoy material benefits by perform-
ing religious rituals for economic development and thereby ultimately
satisfy the senses. He does not want anything more. Such a person works
very hard throughout his life to become very rich and eat very nicely and
drink. By giving some charity for pious activity he can go to a higher
planetary atmosphere in the heavenly planets in his next life, but he does
not want to stop the repetition of birth and death and finish with the
concomitant miserable factors of material existence. Such a person is
called a 81718076017,

A grhastha is a person who lives with family, wife, children and relatives
but has no attachment for them. He prefers to live in family life rather
than as a mendicant or sannyast, but his chief aim is to achieve self-realiza-
tion or to come to the standard of Krsna consciousness. Here, however,
Lord Kapiladeva is speaking about the grhamedhis, who have made their
aim the materialistically prosperous life, which they achieve by sacrificial
ceremonies, by charities and by good work. They are posted in good posi-
tions, and since they know that they are using up their assets of pious
activities, they again and again perform activities of sense gratification. It
is said by Prahlada Maharaja, puneh punas carvita-carvananam: they prefer
to chew the already chewed. Again and again they experience the material
pangs, even if they are rich and prosperous, but they do not want to give
up this kind of life.

TRANSLATION

Such persons are ever bereft of devotional service due to being too
attached to sense gratification, and therefore, although they perform
various kinds of sacrifices and take great vows to satisfy the demigods and
forefathers, they are not interested in Krsna consciousness, devotional
service.

PURPORT

In Bhagavad-gita it is said that persons who worship demigods have lost
their intelligence: kamais tais tair hrta-jianah (Bg. 7.20). They are much
attracted to sense gratification, and therefore they worship the demigods.
It is, of course, recommended in the Vedic scriptures that if one wants
money, health or education, then he should worship the various demigods.
A materialistic person has manifold demands, and thus there are manifold
demigods to satisfy his senses. The grhamedhis, who want to continue a
prosperous materialistic way of life, generally worship the demigods or the
forefathers by offering pinda, or respectful oblations. Such persons are
bereft of Krsna consciousness and are not interested in devotional service
to the Lord. This kind of so-called pious and religious man is the result of
impersonalism. The impersonalists maintain that the Supreme Absolute
Truth has no form and that one can imagine any form he likes for his
benefit and worship in that way. Therefore the grhamedhis or materialistic
men say that they can worship any form of a demigod as worship of the
Supreme Lord. Especially amongst the Hindus, those who are meat-eaters
prefer to worship goddess Kali because it is prescribed that one can sacri-
fice a goat before that goddess. They maintain that whether one worships
the goddess Kali, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead Visnu, or any
demigod, the destination is the same. This is first-class rascaldom, and
such people are misled. But they prefer this philosophy. Bhagavad-gita
does not accept such rascaldom, and it is clearly stated that such methods
are meant for persons who have lost their intelligence. The same judg-
ment is confirmed here, and the word kama-mudha, meaning one who has
lost his sense or is infatuated by the lust of attraction for sense gratifica-
tion, is used. Kama-miidhas are bereft of Krsna consciousness and devo-
tional service and are infatuated by a strong desire for sense gratification. The
worshipers of demigods are condemned both in Bhagavad-gita and in
Srimad-Bhagavatam.

TRANSLATION
Such materialistic persons, attracted by sense gratification and devoted
to the forefathers and demigods, can be elevated to the moon, where they
drink an extract of the soma plant. They again return to this planet.
PURPORT
The moon is considered one of the planets of the heavenly kingdom.
One can be promoted to this planet by executing different sacrifices
recommended in the Vedic literature, such as pious activities in worship-
ing the demigods and forefathers with rigidity and vows. But one cannot
remain there for a very long time. Life on the moon is said to last ten
thousand years according to the calculation of the demigods. The demi-
gods’ time is calculated in such a way that one day (12 hours) is equal to six
months on this planet. It is not possible to reach the moon by any material
vehicle like a sputnik, but persons who are attracted by material enjoy-
ment can go to the moon by pious activities. In spite of being promoted
to the moon, however, one has to come back to this earth again when the
merits of his works in sacrifice are finished. This is also confirmed in
Bhagavad-gitd, Ninth Chapter: te tari bhuktvd svarga-lokari ४5010772 ksine

TRANSLATION

All the planets of the materialistic persons, including all the heavenly
planets, such as the moon, are vanquished at the time when the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Hari, goes to His bed of serpents, which is
known as Ananta Sega.

PURPORT

The materially attached are very eager to promote themselves to the
heavenly planets such as the moon. There are many heavenly planets to
which they aspire just to achieve more and more material happiness by
getting a long duration of life and the paraphernalia for sense enjoyment.
But the attached persons do not know that even if one goes to the highest
planet, Brahmaloka, destruction exists there also. In Bhagavad-gita the Lord
says that one can even go to the Brahmaloka, but still he will find the pangs
of birth, death, disease and old age. Only by approaching the Lord’s
abode, the Vaikunthaloka, does one not take birth again in this material
world. The grhamedhis or materialistic persons, however, do not like to use
this advantage. They would prefer to transmigrate perpetually from one
body to another, or from one planet to another. They do not want eternal,
blissful life in knowledge in the kingdom of God.

There are two kinds of dissolutions. One dissolution takes place at the
end of the life of Brahma. At that time all the planetary systems, including
the heavenly systems, are dissolved in water and enter into the body of
Garbhodakasayi Visnu, who lies on the Garbhodaka Ocean on the bed of
serpents, called Sesa. In the other dissolution, which occurs at the end of
Brahma’s day, all the lower planetary systems are destroyed. When Lord
Brahma rises after his night, these lower planetary systems are again
created. The statement in Bhagavad-gitd that persons who worship the
demigods have lost their intelligence is confirmed in this verse. These less
intelligent persons do not know that even if they are promoted to the
heavenly planets, at the time of dissolution they themselves, the demigods


--- Page 371 ---
1372 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 32
and all their planets will be annihilated. They have no information that
eternal, blissful life can be attained.

TRANSLATION

Those who are intelligent and are of purified consciousness are
completely satisfied in Krsna consciousness. Freed from the modes of
material nature, they do not act for sense gratification, but, since they are
situated in their own occupational duties, they act as one is expected to
act.

PURPORT

The first-class example of this type of man is Arjuna. Arjuna was a
ksatriya, and his occupational duty was to fight. Generally, kings fight to
extend their kingdoms, which they rule for sense gratification. But as far as
Arjuna is concerned, he declined to fight for his own sense gratification.
He said that although he could get a kingdom by fighting with his relatives,
he did not want to fight with them. But when he was ordered by Krsna and
convinced by the teachings of Bhagavad-gitd that his duty was to satisfy
Krsna, then he fought. Thus he fought not for his sense gratification, but
for the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Persons who work at their prescribed duties, not for sense gratification
but for gratification of the Supreme Lord, are called nihsanga, freed from
the influence of the modes of material nature. Nyasta-karmanah indicates
that the results of their activities are given to the Supreme Personality of


--- Page 372 ---

Godhead. Such persons appear to be acting on the platform
of their respective duties, but such activities are not performed for
personal sense gratification; rather, they are performed for the Supreme
Person. Such devotees are called pra$antah, which means completely
satisfied. Suddha-cetasah means Krsna conscious; their consciousness has
become purified. In unpurified consciousness one thinks of himself as the
Lord of the universe, but in purified consciousness one thinks himself the
eternal servant of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Putting oneself in
that position of eternal servitorship to the Supreme Lord and working for
Him perpetually, one actually becomes completely satisfied. As long as
one works for his personal sense gratification, he will always be full of
anxiety. That is the difference between ordinary consciousness and Krsna
consciousness.

nivrtti-dharma—in religious activities for detachment; niratah— constantly

out false egoism: sva-dharma—by one’s own occupational duties; aptena—

TRANSLATION

By executing one’s occupational duties, acting with detachment and
without a sense of proprietorship or false egoism, one is posted in one’s
constitutional position by dint of complete purification of consciousness,
and by thus executing so-called material duties he can easily enter into the
kingdom of God.

PURPORT

Here the word nivrtti-dharma-niratah means constantly engaging in
executing religious activities for detachment. There are two kinds of
religious performances. One is called pravrtti-dharma, which means the
religious activities performed by the grhamedhis for elevation to higher


--- Page 373 ---
1374 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 32
planets or for economic prosperity, the final aim of which is sense gratifi-
cation. Every one of us who has come to this material world has the sense
of overlordship. This is called pravrtti. But the opposite type of religious
performance, which is called nivrtti, is to act for the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. Engaged in devotional service in Krsna consciousness, one has
no proprietorship claim, nor is one situated in the false egoism of thinking
that he is God or the master. He always thinks himself the servant. That is
the process of purifying consciousness. With pure consciousness only can
one enter into the kingdom of God. Materialistic persons, in their elevated
condition, can enter any one of the planets within this material world, but
all are subjected to dissolution over and over again.

PURPORT
The word siirya-dvarena means by the illuminated path, or through the
sun planet. The illuminated path is devotional service. It is advised in the
Vedas not to pass through the darkness, but to pass through the sun
planet. It is also recommended here that by traversing the illuminated


--- Page 374 ---
Text 8] Entanglement in Fruitive Activities 1375
path one can be freed from the contamination of the material modes of
nature; by that path one can enter into the kingdom where the completely
perfect Personality of Godhead resides. The words purusam visvato-mukham
mean the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is all-perfect. All living
entities other than the Supreme Personality of Godhead are very small,
although they may be big by our calculation. Everyone is infinitesimal,
and therefore in the Vedas the Supreme Lord is called the Supreme Eternal
amongst all eternals. He is the proprietor of the material and spiritual
worlds and the supreme cause of manifestation. Material nature is only
the ingredient because actually the manifestation is caused by His energy.
The material energy is also His energy; just as the combination of father
and mother is the cause of childbirth, so the combination of the material
energy and the glance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the cause
of the manifestation of the material world. The efficient cause, therefore,
is not matter, but the Lord Himself.

TRANSLATION

Worshipers of the Hiranyagarbha expansion of the Personality of
Godhead remain within this material world until the end of two parardhas,
when Lord Brahma also dies.

PURPORT

One dissolution is at the end of Brahma’s day, and one is at the end of

Brahma’s life. Brahma dies at the end of two parardhas, at which time the


--- Page 375 ---
1376 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 32
entire material universe is dissolved. Persons who are worshipers of
Hiranyagarbha, the plenary expansion of the Supreme Personality of God-
head Garbhodakasayi Vispu, do not directly approach the Supreme
Personality of Godhead in Vaikuntha. They remain within this universe on
Satyaloka or other higher planets until the end of the life of Brahma. Then,
with Brahma, they are elevated to the spiritual kingdom.

The words parasya para-cintakah mean always thinking of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead or being always Krsna conscious. When we speak of
Krsna this refers to the complete category of vispu-tattva. Krsna includes
the three purusa incarnations, namely Maha-Vignu, Garbhodakasayi Visnu
and Kgirodakasayi Visnu, as well as all the incarnations taken together.
This is confirmed in the Brahma-samhita. Ramadi-miirtisu kala-niyamena
tisthan: Lord Krsna is perpetually situated with His many expansions, such
as Rama, Nrsimha, Vamana, Madhusiidana, Vignu and Narayana. He exists
with all His plenary portions and the portions of His plenary portions, and
each of them is as good as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The words
parasya para-cintakah mean those who are fully Krsna conscious. Such per-
sons enter directly into the kingdom of God, the Vaikuntha planets, or, if
they are worshipers of the plenary portion Garbhodakasayi Visnu, then
they remain within this universe until dissolution, and after that they
enter.

TRANSLATION
After experiencing the inhabitable time of the three modes of material
nature, known as two parardhas, Lord Brahma closes the material universe,
which is covered by layers of earth, water, air, fire, ether, mind, ego, etc.,
and goes back to Godhead.
PURPORT
The word avydkrtam is very significant in this verse. The same meaning
is stated in Bhagavad-gita, in the word sandtana. This material world is
vydkrta, or subject to changes, and it finally dissolves. But after the
dissolution of this material world, the manifestation of the spiritual world,
the sanatana-dhama, remains. That spiritual sky is called avyakrta, that
which does not change, and there the Supreme Personality of Godhead
resides. When, after ruling over the material universe under the influence of
the time element, Lord Brahma desires to dissolve it and enter into the
kingdom of God, others then enter with him.

which is far, far away. After giving up their bodies, they enter into the
body of Lord Brahma, and therefore when Brahma is liberated and goes
to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the Supreme Brahman,
such yogis can also enter into the kingdom of God.
PURPORT
By perfecting their yogic practice, yogis can reach the highest planet,
Brahmaloka or Satyaloka, and after giving up their material bodies, they
can enter into the body of Lord Brahma. Because they are not directly
devotees of the Lord, they cannot get liberation directly. They have to
wait until Brahma is liberated, and only then, along with Brahma, are they
also liberated. It is clear that as long as a living entity is a worshiper of a
particular demigod, his consciousness is absorbed in thoughts of that
demigod, and therefore he cannot get direct liberation, or entrance into the
kingdom of God, nor can he merge into the impersonal effulgence of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such yogis or demigod worshipers are
subjected to the chance of taking birth again when there is again creation.

as lover, as Supreme Soul, as son, as friend or as master. One can reestab-
lish the transcendental loving relationship with the Supreme Lord in so
many ways, and that feeling is true oneness. The oneness of the Mayavadi
philosophers and the oneness of Vaignava philosophers are different. The
Mayavadi and Vaignava philosophers both want to merge into the Supreme,
but the Vaignavas do not lose their identities. They want to keep the
identity of lover, parent, friend, or servant.

In the transcendental world, the servant and master are one. That is the
absolute platform. Although the relationship is servant and master, both
the servant and the served stand on the same platform. That is oneness.
Lord Kapila advised His mother that she did not need any indirect process.
She was already situated in that direct process because the Supreme Lord
had takenbirth as her son. Actually, she did not need any further instruc-
tion because she was already in the perfectional stage. Kapiladeva advised
her to continue in the same way. He therefore addressed His mother as
bhamini to indicate that she was already thinking of the Lord as her son.
Devahiiti is advised by Lord Kapila to take directly to devotional service,
Krsna consciousness, because without that consciousness one cannot be-
come liberated from the clutches of maya.

My dear mother, someone may worship the Supreme Personality of
Godhead with a special self-interest, but even demigods such as Lord
Brahma, great sages such as Sanat-kumara, and great munis such as
Marici have to come back to the material world again at the time of
creation. When the interaction of the three modes of material nature
begins, Brahma, who is the creator of this cosmic manifestation and who
is full of Vedic knowledge, and the great sages, who are the authors of the


--- Page 380 ---
Texts 12-15] Entanglement in Fruitive Activities 1381
spiritual path and the yoga system, come back under the influence of the
time factor. Although they are liberated by their nonfruitive activities and
they attain the first incarnation of the purusa, still, at the time of creation,
they come back in exactly the same forms and positions as they had
previously.

PURPORT

That Brahma becomes liberated is known to everyone, but he cannot
liberate his devotees. Demigods like Brahma and Lord Siva cannot give
liberation to any living entity. As it is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita, only
one who surrenders unto Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, can
be liberated from the clutches of maya. Brahma is called here adyah
sthira-caranam. He is the original, first-created living entity, and after his
own birth he creates the entire cosmic manifestation. He was fully in-
structed in the matter of creation by the Supreme Lord. Here he is called
veda-garbha, which means that he knows the complete purpose of the
Vedas. He is always accompanied by such great personalities as Marici,
Kasdyapa and the seven sages, as well as by great mystic yogis, the Kumaras
and many other spiritually advanced living entities, but he has his own
interest, separate from the Lord’s. Bheda-drstyd means that Brahma
sometimes thinks that he is independent of the Supreme Lord, or
he thinks of himself as one of the three equally independent incarna-
tions. Brahma is entrusted with creation, Visnu maintains, and Rudra,
Lord Siva, destroys. The three of them are understood to be incarnations
of the Supreme Lord in charge of the three different material modes of
nature, but none of them is independent of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Here the word bheda-drstya occurs because Brahma has a slight
inclination to think that he is as independent as Rudra. Sometimes Brahma
thinks that he is independent of the Supreme Lord, and the worshiper also
thinks that he is independent. For this reason, after the destruction of this
material world, when there is again creation by the interaction of the
material modes of nature, Brahma comes back. Although Brahma reaches
the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the first purusa incarnation, Maha-
Visnu, who is full with transcendental qualities, still he cannot stay in the
spiritual world.

The specific significance of his coming back may be noted. Brahma and
the great rsis and the great master of yoga (Siva) are not ordinary living
entities; they are very powerful and have all the perfections of mystic
yoga. But still they have an inclination to try to become one with the Su-
preme, and therefore they have to come back. In the Srimad-Bhagavatam


--- Page 381 ---
1382 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 32
it is accepted that as long as one thinks that he is equal with the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, he is not completely purified or knowledgeable.
In spite of going up to the first purusa-avatara, Maha-Visnu, after the dis-
solution of this material creation, such personalities again fall down or
come back to the material creation.

It is a great falldown on the part of the impersonalists to think that the
Supreme Lord appears within a material body and that one should there-
fore not meditate upon the form of the Supreme but should meditate in-
stead on the formless. For this particular mistake, even the great mystic
yogis or great stalwart transcendentalists also come back again when there
is creation. All living entities other than the impersonalists and monists
can directly take to devotional service in full Krsna consciousness and
become liberated by developing transcendental loving service for the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such devotional service develops in the
degrees of thinking of the Supreme Lord as master, as friend, as son, and,
at last, as lover. These distinctions in transcendental variegatedness must
always be present.

persons who are too materially attached. It is enjoined in the Vedic scrip-

tures that those who are attached to the enjoyment of material facilities
have to sacrifice and undergo certain ritualistic performances. They have
to observe certain rules and regulations in their daily lives to be elevated
to the heavenly planets. It is stated in this verse that such persons cannot
be liberated at any time. Those who worship demigods with the conscious-
ness that each and every demigod is a separate God cannot be elevated to
the spiritual world, what to speak of persons who are simply attached to
duties for the upliftment of their material condition.

TRANSLATION

Such persons are called trai-vargika because they are interested in the
three elevating processes. They are averse to the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, who can give relief to the conditioned soul. They are not
interested in the Supreme Personality’s pastimes, which are worth hearing
because of His transcendental prowess.

PURPORT

According to Vedic thought, there are four elevating principles, namely
religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and liberation. Per-
sons who are simply interested in material enjoyment make plans to execute
prescribed duties. They are interested in the three elevating processes of
religious rituals, economic elevation and sense enjoyment. By developing
their economic condition, they can enjoy material life. Materialistic
persons, therefore, are interested in those elevating processes, which are
called trai-vargika. Trai means three; vargika means elevating processes.
Such materialistic persons are never attracted by the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. Rather, they are antagonistic towards Him.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is here described as hari-
medhah, or He who can deliver one from the cycle of birth and death.
Materialistic persons are never interested in hearing about the marvelous
pastimes of the Lord. They think that they are fictions and stories and that
the Supreme Godhead is also a man of material nature. They are not fit
for advancing in devotional service or Krsna consciousness. Such material-
istic persons are interested in newspaper stories, novels and imaginary
dramas. The factual activities of the Lord, such as Lord Krsna’s acting in
the Battle of Kuruksetra, or the activities of the Pandavas, or the Lord’s
activities in Vrndavana or Dvaraka, are related in the Bhagavad-gita and
Srimad-Bhagavatam, which are full of the activities of the Lord. But
materialistic persons who engage in elevating their position in the material
world are not interested in such activities of the Lord. They may be in-
terested in the activities of a great politician or a great rich man of this
world, but they are not interested in the transcendental activities of the
Supreme Lord.

TRANSLATION
Such persons are condemned by the supreme order of the Lord. Because
they are averse to the nectar of the activities of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, they are compared to stool-eating hogs. They give up hearing
the transcendental activities of the Lord and indulge in hearing of the
abominable activities of materialistic persons.
PURPORT
Everyone is addicted to hearing of the activities of another person,
whether a politician, or a rich man, or an imaginary character whose
activities are created in a novel. There are so many nonsensical literatures,
stories and books of speculative philosophy. Materialistic persons are very
interested in reading such literature, but when they are presented with
genuine books of knowledge like Srimad-Bhagavatam, Bhagavad-gita,
Visnu Purana or other scriptures of the world, such as the Bible and Koran,
they are not interested. These persons are condemned by the supreme
order as much as a hog is condemned. The hog is interested in eating stool.
If the hog is offered some nice preparation made of condensed milk or
ghee, he won’t like it; he would prefer obnoxious, bad-smelling stool,
which he finds very relishable. Materialistic persons are considered to be
condemned because they are interested in hellish activities and not in
transcendental activities. The message of the Lord’s activities is nectar,

and besides that message, any information in which we may be interested

Such materialistic persons are allowed to go to the planet called Pitrloka
by the southern course of the sun, but they again come back to this planet
and take birth in their own families, beginning again the same fruitive
activities from birth to the end of life.
PURPORT
In Bhagavad-gita, Ninth Chapter, twenty-first verse, it is stated that such
persons are elevated to the higher planetary systems. As soon as their
lifetimes of fruitive activity are finished, they again return to this planet,
and thus they go up and come down. Those who are elevated to the higher
planets again come back into the same family for which they had too
much attachment; they are born, and the fruitive activities continue again
until the end of life. There are different prescribed rituals from birth until
the end of life, and they are very much attached to such activities.

TRANSLATION
When the results of their pious activities are exhausted, they fall down
by higher arrangement and again come back to this planet, just as any
person raised to a high position sometimes all of a sudden falls.
PURPORT
It is sometimes found that a person elevated to a very high position in
government service falls down all of a sudden, and no one can check him.
Similarly, after finishing their period of enjoyment, foolish persons who
are very much interested in being elevated to the position of President in
higher planets also fall down to this planet. The distinction between the
elevated position of a devotee and that of an ordinary person attracted to
fruitive activities is that when a devotee is elevated to the spiritual king-
dom he never falls down, whereas an ordinary person falls, even if he is
elevated to the highest planetary system, Brahmaloka. It is confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita (abrahma-bhuvandl lokah) that even if one is elevated to a
higher planet he has to come down again. But Krsna confirms in
Bhagavad-gita, mam upetya tu kaunteya punar janma na vidyate
(Bg. 8.16): “Anyone who attains My abode never comes back to this
conditioned life of material existence.”

tasmat—therefore; tvam—you (Devahiiti); sarva-bhavena—with loving
ecstasy; bhajasva—worship; paramesthinam—the Supreme Personality of
Godhead; tat-guna—the qualities of the Lord; @$rayay@—connected with;
bhaktya—by devotional service; bhajaniya—worshipable; pada-ambujam—

TRANSLATION

My dear mother, I therefore advise that you take shelter of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead because His lotus feet are worth worshiping.
Accept this with all devotion and love, for thus you can be situated in
transcendental devotional service.

PURPORT

The word paramesthina is sometimes used in connection with Brahma.
Paramesthina means the supreme person. As Brahma is the supreme
person within this universe, similarly Krsna is the Supreme Personality in
the spiritual world. Lord Kapiladeva advises His mother that she should
take shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Krsna, because it is worthwhile. Taking shelter of demigods, even those
in the highest positions, like Brahma and Siva, is not advised herein. One
should take shelter of the Supreme Godhead.

Sarva-bhavena means “in all-loving ecstasy.” Bhava is the preliminary
stage of elevation before the attainment of pure love of Godhead. It is
stated in Bhagavad-gita, budha bhavae-samanvitah: one who has attained
the stage of bhava can accept the lotus feet of Lord Krsna as worshipable.
This is also advised here by Lord Kapila to His mother. Also significant in
this verse is the phrase tad-gunasrayaya bhaktya. This means that discharg-
ing devotional service unto Krsna is transcendental; it is not material
activity. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita: those who engage in devotion-
al service are accepted to be situated in the spiritual kingdom. Brahma-
bhuyaya kalpate: they at once become situated in the transcendental
kingdom.

Devotional service in full Krsna consciousness is the only means for
attaining the highest perfection of life for the human being. This is
recommended herein by Lord Kapila to His mother. Bhakti is therefore
nirguna, free from all tinges of material qualities. Although the discharge
of devotional service appears to be like material activities, it is never
saguna, or contaminated by material qualities. Tad-gunasrayaya means


--- Page 388 ---
Text 23] Entanglement in Fruitive Activities 1389
that Lord Krsna’s transcendental qualities are so sublime that there is no
need to divert one’s attention to any other activities. His behavior with the
devotees is so exalted that a devotee need not try to divert his attention to
any other worship. It is said that the demoniac Patana came to kill Krsna
by poisoning Him, but because Krsna was pleased to suck her breast, she
was given the same position as His mother. Devotees pray, therefore, that
if a demon who wanted to kill Krsna gets such an exalted position, why
should they go to anyone other than Krsna for their worshipful attach-
ment? There are two kinds of religious activities: one for material advance-
ment and the other for spiritual advancement. By taking shelter under the
lotus feet of Krsna, one is endowed with both kinds of prosperity, material
and spiritual. Why then should one go to any demigod?

Engagement in Krsna consciousness and application of devotional

detachment, as well as in self-realization.
PURPORT
It is said by less intelligent men that bhakti-yoga or devotional service is
meant for persons who are not advanced in transcendental knowledge and
renunciation. But the fact is that if one engages in the devotional service
of the Lord in full Krsna consciousness, he does not have to attempt
separately to practice detachment or to wait for an awakening of tran-


--- Page 389 ---
1390 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 32
scendental knowledge. It is said that one who engages unflinchingly in the
devotional service of the Lord actually has all the good qualities of the
demigods develop in him automatically. One cannot discover how such
good qualities develop in the body of a devotee, but actually it happens.
There is one instance where a hunter was taking pleasure in killing animals,
but after becoming a devotee he was not prepared to kill even an ant. Such
is the quality of a devotee.

Those who are very eager to advance in transcendental knowledge can
engage themselves in pure devotional service, without wasting time in
mental speculation. For arriving at the positive conclusions of knowledge
in the Absolute Truth, the word brahma-darsanam 15 significant in this
verse. Brahma-darsanam means to realize or to understand the Transcen-
dence. One who engages in the service of Vasudeva can actually realize
what Brahman is. If Brahman is impersonal, then there is no question of
darsanam, which means seeing face to face. Barsanam refers to seeing the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vasudeva. Unless the seer and the seen
are persons, there is no darsanam. Brahma-darsanam means that as soon as
one sees the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he can at once realize what
impersonal Brahman is. A devotee does not need to make separate inves-
tigations to understand the nature of Brahman. Bhagavad-gita also confirms
this. Brahma-bhuyaya kalpate: a devotee at once becomes a self-realized
soul in the Absolute Truth.

PURPORT

The significance of advancement in transcendental knowledge and
detachment from material attraction is exhibited in the personality of a
highly advanced devotee. For him there is nothing agreeable or disagree-
able because he does not act in any way for his personal sense gratifica-
tion. Whatever he does, whatever he thinks, is for the satisfaction of the
Personality of Godhead. Either in the material world or in the spiritual
world, his equipoised mind is completely manifested. He can understand
that in the material world there is nothing good; everything 15 bad due to
its being contaminated by material nature. The materialists’ conclusions of
good and bad, moral and immoral, etc., are simply mental concoction or
sentiment. Actually there is nothing good in the material world. In the
spiritual field everything is absolutely good. There is no inebriety in the
spiritual varieties. Because a devotee accepts everything in spiritual vision,
he is equipoised; that is the symptom of his being elevated to the tran-
scendental position. He automatically attains detachment, vairagya, then
jiana, knowledge, and then actual transcendental knowledge. The conclu-
sion is that an advanced devotee dovetails himself in the transcendental
qualities of the Lord, and in that sense he becomes qualitatively one with
the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

see anything as superior or inferior, and he feels himself elevated to the
transcendental platform of being equal in qualities with the Supreme
Person.
PURPORT

Perception of the disagreeable arises from attachment. A devotee has no
personal attachment to anything; therefore for him there is no question of
agreeable or disagreeable. For the service of the Lord he can accept any-
thing, even though it may be disagreeable to his personal interest. In fact,
he is completely free from personal interest, and thus anything agreeable
to the Lord is agreeable to him. For example, for Arjuna at first fighting
was not agreeable, but when he understood that the fighting was agreeable
to the Lord, he accepted the fighting as agreeable. That is the position of
a pure devotee. For his personal interest there is nothing which is agreeable
or disagreeable; everything is done for the lord, and therefore he is free
from attachment and detachment. That is the transcendental stage of
neutrality. A pure devotee enjoys life in the pleasure of the Supreme Lord.

the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or the purusa-avatara.


--- Page 392 ---
Text 26] Entanglement in Fruitive Activities 1393
PURPORT

The word drsyadibhih is significant. According to Jiva Gosvami,
drsya means jaana, philosophical research. By different processes of
philosophical research under different concepts, such as the process of
jnana-yoga, the same Bhagavan, or Supreme Personality of Godhead, is
understood as impersonal Brahman. Similarly, by the eightfold yoga
system He appears as the Paramatma. But in pure Krgna consciousness, or
knowledge in purity, when one tries to understand the Absolute Truth,
one realizes Him as the Supreme Person. The Transcendence is realized
simply on the basis of knowledge. The words used here, paramdatmesvarah
puman, are all transcendental, and they refer to Supersoul. Supersoul is
also described as purusa, but the word Bhagavan directly refers to the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is full of six opulences: wealth,
fame, strength, beauty, knowledge and renunciation. He is the Personality
of Godhead in different spiritual skies. The various descriptions of
paramatmad, isvara and puman indicate that the expansions of the Supreme
Godhead are unlimited.

Ultimately, to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead one
has to accept bhakti-yoga. By executing jiana-yoga or dhyana-yoga one has
to eventually approach the bhakti-yoga platform, and then paramatmad,
एण्या, pumadn, etc., are all clearly understood. It is recommended in the
Second Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam that whether one is a devotee, or
fruitive actor, or liberationist, if he is intelligent enough, he should engage
himself with all seriousness in the process of devotional service. It is also
explained that whatever one desires which is obtainable by fruitive activities,
even if one wants to be elevated to higher planets, can be achieved simply
by execution of devotional service. Since the Supreme Lord is full in six
opulences, He can bestow any one of them upon the worshiper.

The one Supreme Personality of Godhead reveals Himself to different
thinkers as the Supreme Person, or impersonal Brahman, or Paramatma.
Impersonalists merge into the impersonal Brahman, but that is not achieved
by worshiping the impersonal Brahman. If one takes to devotional service
and at the same time desires to merge into the existence of the Supreme
Lord, he can achieve that. If someone desires at all to merge into the
existence of the Supreme, he has to execute devotional service.

The devotee can see the Supreme lord face to face, but the jaan,
the empiric philosopher, or yogi cannot. They cannot be elevated to the
positions of associates of the Lord. There is no evidence in the scriptures
stating that by cultivating knowledge or worshiping the impersonal
Brahman one can become a personal associate of the Supreme Personality


--- Page 393 ---
1394 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 32
of Godhead. Nor by executing the yogic principles can one become an
associate of the Supreme Godhead. Impersonal Brahman, being formless,
is described as adrsya because the impersonal effulgence of brahmajyoti
covers the face of the Supreme Lord. Some yogis see the four-handed
Vispu sitting within the heart, and therefore in their case also the Supreme
Lord is invisible. Only for the devotees is the Lord visible. Here the state-
ment drsyddibhih is significant. Since the Supreme Personality of
Godhead is both invisible and visible, there are different features of the
Lord. The Paramatma feature and Brahman feature are invisible, but the
Bhagavan feature is visible. In the Visnu Purana this fact is very nicely
explained. The universal form of the Lord and the formless Brahman
effulgence of the Lord, being invisible, are inferior features. The concept
of the universal form is material, and the concept of impersonal Brahman
is spiritual, but the highest spiritual understanding is the Personality
of Godhead. Visnu Purana states, visnur brahma-svarupena svayam eva
vyavasthitah: Brahman’s real feature is Visnu, or the Supreme Brahman is
Visnu. Svayam eva: that is His personal feature. The supreme spiritual
conception is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is also confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita: yad gatva na nivartante tad dhama paramam mama. That
specific abode called paramam mama is the place from which, once one
attains it, one does not return to this miserable conditional life. Every
place, every space and every thing belongs to Visnu, but where He per-
sonally lives is tad dhama paramam, His supreme abode. One has to make
his destination the supreme abode of the Lord.

TRANSLATION

The greatest common understanding for all yogis is complete detachment

from matter, which can be achieved by different kinds of yoga.
PURPORT

There are three kinds of yoga, namely bhakti-yoga, jiiana-yoga, and
astanga-yoga. Devotees, jiidnis and yogis all try to get out of the material
entanglement. The jiidnis try to detach their sensual activities from material
engagement. The jiiana-yogi thinks that matter is false and that Brahman is
truth; he tries, therefore, by cultivation of knowledge, to detach the senses
from material enjoyment. The astanga-yogis also try to control the senses.
The devotees, however, try to engage the senses in the service of the Lord.
Therefore it appears that the activities of the bhaktas, devotees, are better
than those of the jiianis and yogis. The mystic yogis simply try to control
the senses by practicing the eight divisions of yoga—yama, niyama, dsana,
prandyama, pratyahdra, etc.—and the jianis try by mental reasoning to
understand that sense enjoyment is false. But the easiest and most direct
process is to engage the senses in the service of the Lord.

The purpose of all yoga is to detach one’s sense activities from this
material world. The final aims, however, are different. Jiianis want to be-
come one with the Brahman effulgence, yogis want to realize Paramatma,
and devotees want to develop Krsna consciousness and transcendental
loving service to the Lord. That loving service is the perfect stage of sense
control. The senses are actually active symptoms of life, and they cannot
be stopped. They can be detached only if there is superior engagement. As
it is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita, param drstva nivartate. The activities of
the senses can be stopped if they are given superior engagements. The
supreme engagement is to engage the senses in the service of the Lord.
That is the purpose of all yoga.

TRANSLATION

Those who are averse to the Transcendence realize the Supreme
Absolute Truth differently through speculative sense perception, and
therefore, because of mistaken speculation, everything appears to them to
be relative.

PURPORT

The Supreme Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead, is one, and
He is spread everywhere by His impersonal feature. This is clearly expressed
in Bhagavad-gita. Lord Krsna says, “Everything that is experienced is but
an expansion of My energy.” Everything is sustained by Him, but that does
not mean that He is in everything. Sense perceptions, such as aural percep-
tion of the sound of a drum, visual perception of a beautiful woman, or
perception of the delicious taste of a milk preparation by the tongue, all
come through different senses and are therefore differently understood.
Therefore sensory knowledge is divided in different categories, although
actually everything is one as a manifestation of the energy of the Supreme
Lord. Similarly, the energies of fire are heat and illumination, and by these
two energies, fire can display itself in many varieties, or in diversified
sense perception. Mayavadi philosophers declare this diversity to be false.
But Vaisnava philosophers do not accept the different manifestations as
false; they accept them as nondifferent from the Supreme Personality of
Godhead because they are a display of His diverse energies.

The philosophy that the Absolute is true and this creation is false
(brahma satyam jagan-mithyd) is not accepted by Vaisnava philosophers.
The example is given that although all that glitters is not gold, this does
not mean that a glittering object is false. For example, an oyster shell
appears to be golden. This appearance of golden hue is due only to the
perception of the eyes, but that does not mean that the oyster shell is
false. Similarly, by seeing the form of Lord Krsna one cannot understand
what He actually is, but this does not mean that He is false. The form of
Krsna has to be understood as it is described in the books of knowledge
such as Brahma-sarihita. I§varah paramah krsnah sac-cid-dinanda-vigrahah:
Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has an eternal, blissful spiritual
body. By our imperfect sense perception we cannot understand the form


--- Page 396 ---
Text 28] Entanglement in Fruitive Activities 1397
of the Lord. We have to acquire knowledge about Him. Therefore it is said
here, jiidnam ekam. Bhagavad-gita confirms that they are fools who, simply
upon seeing Krsna, consider Him a common man. They do not know the
unlimited knowledge, power and opulence of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Material sense speculation leads to the conclusion that the
Supreme is formless. It is because of such mental speculation that the con-
ditioned soul remains in ignorance under the spell of illusory energy.
The Supreme Person has to be understood by the transcendental sound
vibrated by Him in Bhagavad-gita, wherein He says that there is nothing
superior to Himself; the impersonal Brahman effulgence is resting on His
personality. The purified, absolute vision of Bhagavad-gitd is compared to
the River Ganges. Ganges water is so pure that it can purify even the asses
and cows. But anyone who, disregarding the pure Ganges, wishes to be
purified instead by the filthy water flowing in a drain, cannot be success-
ful. Similarly, one can successfully attain pure knowledge of the Absolute
only by hearing from the pure Absolute Himself.

In this versc it is clearly said that those who are averse to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead speculate with their imperfect senses about the
nature of the Absolute Truth. The formless Brahman conception, however,
can be received only by aural reception and not by personal experience.
Knowledge is therefore acquired by aural reception. It is confirmed in the
Vedanta-siitra, sastra-yonitvat: one has to acquire pure knowledge from the
authorized scriptures. So-called speculative arguments about the Absolute
Truth are therefore useless. The actual identity of the living entity is his
consciousness, which is always present while the living entity is awake,
dreaming, or in deep slecp. Even in decp sleep, he can perceive by con-
sciousness whether he is happy or distressed. Thus when consciousness is
displayed through the medium of the subtle and gross material bodies, it is
covered, but when the consciousness is purified, in Krsna consciousness,
one becomes free from the entanglement of repeated birth and death.

When uncontaminated pure knowledge is uncovered from the modes of
material nature, then the actual identity of the living entity is discovered:
he is eternally a servitor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The
process of uncovering is like this: the rays of sunshine are luminous, and
the sun itself is also luminous. In the presence of the sun, the rays illumi-
nate just like the sun, but when the sunshine is covered by the spell of a
cloud, or by maya, then darkness, the imperfection of perception, begins.
Therefore, to get out of the entanglement of the spell of nescience, one has
to awaken his spiritual consciousness or Krsna consciousness in terms of
the authorized scriptures.

TRANSLATION

From the total energy, the mahat-tattva, 1 have manifested the false
ego, the three modes of material nature, the five material elements, the
individual consciousness, the eleven senses and the material body. Similarly,
the entire universe has come from the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

PURPORT

The Supreme Lord is described as mahat-pada, which means that the
total material energy known as the mahat-tattva is lying at His lotus feet.
The origin or the total energy of the cosmic manifestation is the mahat-
tattva. From the mahat-tattva all the other twenty-four divisions have
sprung, namely the eleven senses (including the mind), the five sense
objects, the five material elements, and then consciousness, intelligence
and false ego. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the cause of the
mahal-tattva, and therefore, in one sense, because everything is an emana-
tion from the Supreme Lord, there is no difference between the Lord and
the cosmic manifestation. But at the same lime the cosmic manifestation
is different from the Lord. The word sva-rat is very significant here. Sva-rat
means independent. The Supreme Lord is independent, and the individual
soul is also independent. Although there is no comparison between the two
qualities of independence, the living entity is minutely independent, and
the Supreme Lord is fully independent. As the individual soul has a material
body made of five elements and the senses, the Supreme Independent Lord


--- Page 398 ---
Text 30] Entanglement in Fruitive Activities 1399
similarly has the gigantic body of the universe. The individual body is
temporary; similarly, the entire universe, which is considered to be the
body of the Supreme Lord, is also temporary, and both the individual and
universal bodies are products of the mahat-tattva. One has to understand
the differences with intelligence. Everyone knows that his material body
has developed from a spiritual spark, and similarly the universal body has
developed from the supreme spark, Supersoul. As the individual body
develops from the individual soul, so the gigantic body of the universe
develops from the Supreme Soul. Just as the individual soul has con-
sciousness, so the Supreme Soul is also conscious. But although there is a
similarity between the consciousness of the Supreme Soul and the cons
ciousness of the individual soul, the individual soul’s consciousness is
limited, whereas the consciousness of the Supreme Soul is unlimited. This
is described in Bhagavad-gita. Ksetrajiiari capi mam viddhi (Bg. 13.3): the
Supersoul is present in every field of activity, just as the individual soul
is present in the individual body. Both of them are conscious. The dif-
ference is that the individual soul is conscious of the individual body only,
whereas the Supersoul is conscious of the total number of individual
bodies.

TRANSLATION
This perfect knowledge can be achieved by a person who is already
engaged in devotional service with faith, steadiness and full detachment,
and who is always absorbed in thought of the Supreme. He is aloof from
material association.

PURPORT
The atheistic mystic practitioner of yoga cannot understand this
perfect knowledge. Only persons who engage in the practical activities of
devotional service in full Krsna consciousness can become absorbed in full
samadhi. It is possible for them to see and understand the actual fact of the
entire cosmic manifestation and its cause. It is clearly stated here that this
is not possible for one who has not developed devotional service in full
faith to understand. The words samahitatma and samadhi are synonomous.

TRANSLATION

Philosophical research culminates in understanding the Supreme Person-
ality of Godhead. After achieving this understanding, when one becomes
free from the material modes of nature, he attains the stage of devotional
service. Either by devotional service directly or by philosophical research,
one has to find the same destination, which is the Supreme Personality of
Godhead.

PURPORT

It is said in Bhagavad-gita that after many, many lives of philosophical
research the wise man ultimately comes to the point of knowing that
Vasudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is everything, and there-
fore he surrenders unto Him. Such serious students in philosophical
research are rare because they are very great souls. If by philosophical
research one cannot come to the point of understanding the Supreme
Person, then his task is not finished. His search in knowledge is still to be
continued until he comes to the point of understanding the Supreme
Lord in devotional service.

The opportunity for direct touch with the Personality of Godhead is
given in Bhagavad-gita, where it is also said that those who take to other
processes, namely the processes of philosophical speculation and mystic
yoga practice, have much trouble. After many, many years of much
trouble, a yogt or wise philosopher may come to Him, but his path is very
troublesome, whereas the path of devotional service is easy for everyone.
One can achieve the result of wise philosophical speculation simply by
discharging devotional service, and unless one reaches the point of the
Personality of Godhead by his mental speculation, then all his research
work is said to be simply a labor of love. The ultimate destination of the
wise philosopher is to merge in the impersonal Brahman, but that
Brahman is the effulgence of the Supreme Person. The Lord says in
Bhagavad-gita, brahmano hi pratisthaham amytasyavyayasya ca: “न्‌ am the
basis of the impersonal Brahman, which is indestructible and is the supreme
bliss.” The Lord is the supreme reservoir of all pleasure, including Brahman


--- Page 401 ---
1402 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 32
pleasure; therefore, one who has unflinching faith in the Supreme Person-
ality of Godhead is to be said to be already realized in impersonal Brahman
and Param@tma.

TRANSLATION

A single object is appreciated differently by different senses due to its
having different qualities. Similarly, the Supreme Personality of Godhead
is one, but according to different scriptural injunctions He appears to be
different.

PURPORT

It appears that by following the path of jiana-yoga, or empiric philo-
sophical speculation, one reaches the impersonal Brahman, whereas by
executing devotional service in Krsna consciousness one enriches his faith
in and devotion to the Personality of Godhead. But it is stated here
that both bhakti-yoga and jiana-yoga are meant for reaching the same
destination—the Personality of Godhead. By the process of jiiana-yoga the
same Personality of Godhead appears to be impersonal. As the same object
appears to be different when perceived by different senses, similarly the
same Supreme Lord appears to be impersonal by mental speculation. A
hill appears cloudy from a distance, and one who does not know may
speculate that the hill is a cloud. Actually, it is not a cloud; it is a big hill.
One has to learn from authority that the sight of a cloud is not actually a
cloud but a hill. If one makes a little more progress, then instead of a


--- Page 402 ---
Text 33] Entanglement in Fruitive Activities 1403
cloud he sees the hill and something green. When one actually approaches
the hill, he will see many varieties. Another example is in perceiving milk.
When we see milk, we see that it is white; when we taste it, it appears that
milk is very palatable. When we touch milk, it appears very cold; when we
smell milk, it appears to have a very good flavor; and when we hear, we
understand that it is called milk. Perceiving milk with different senses, we
say that it is something white, something very delicious, something very
aromatic, and so on. Actually, it is milk. Similarly, those who are trying
to find the Supreme Godhead by mental speculation may approach the
bodily effulgence, or the impersonal Brahman, and those who are trying
to find the Supreme Godhead by yoga practice may find Him as the
localized Supersoul, bul those who are directly trying to approach the
Supreme Truth by practice of bhakti-yoga can see Him face to face as the
Supreme Person.

Ultimately, the Supreme Person is the destination of all different
processes. The fortunate person who, by following the principles of scrip-
tures, becomes completely purified of all material contamination, surrenders
unto the Supreme Lord as everything. Just as one can appreciate the real
taste of milk with the tongue and not with the eyes, nostrils or ears, one
can similarly appreciate the Absolute Truth perfectly and with all relish-
able pleasure only through one path, devotional service. This is also
confirmed in Bhagavad-gitd, bhaktya mam abhijanati: if one wants to
understand the Absolute Truth in perfection, he must take to devotional
service. Of course, no one can understand the Absolute Truth in all perfec-
tion. That is not possible for the infinitesimal living entities. But the
highest point of understanding by the living entity is reached by discharge
of devotional service, not otherwise.

By following various scriptural paths, one may come to the impersonal
effulgence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The transcendental
pleasure derived from merging with or understanding the impersonal
Brahman is very extensive because Brahman isananta. Tad-brahma-niskalarm
anantam: brahmananda is unlimited. But that unlimited pleasure can also
be surpassed. That is the nature of the Transcendence. The unlimited can
be surpassed also, and that higher platform is Krsna. When one deals
directly with Krsna, the mellow and the humor relished by reciprocation
of devotional service is incomparable, even with the pleasure derived from
transcendental Brahman. Prabodhananda Sarasvati therefore says that
kaivalya, the Brahman pleasure, is undoubtedly very greal and is appre-
ciated by many philosophers, but lo a devotee who has understood how
to derive pleasure from exchanging devotional service with the Lord, this


--- Page 403 ---
1404 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 32
unlimited Brahman appears to be hellish. One should try, therefore, to
transcend even the Brahman pleasure in order to approach the position of
dealing with Krsna face to face. As the mind is the center of all the activi-
ties of the senses, so Krsna is called the master of the senses, Hrsikesa. The
process is to fix the mind on Hrgikeda or Krsna, as Maharaja Ambariga did
(sa vai manah krsna-paddravindayoh). Bhakti is the basic principle of all
processes. Without bhakti, neither jiana-yoge nor astanga-yoga can be
successful, and unless one approaches Krsna, the principles of self-
realization have no ultimate destination.

TRANSLATION

By performing fruitive activities and sacrifices, by distributing charity,
by performing austerities, by studying various literatures, by conducting
philosophical research, by controlling the mind, by subduing the senses,
by accepting the renounced order of life, and by performing the prescribed
duties of one’s social order; by performing the different divisions of yoga
practice, by performing devotional service, and by exhibiting the process
of devotional service containing the symptoms of both attachment and
detachment; by understanding the science of self-realization and by devel-
oping a strong sense of detachment, one who is expert in understanding
the different processes of self-realization realizes the Supreme Personality
of Godhead as He is represented in the material world as well as in
transcendence.

PURPORT

As it is stated in the previous verse, one has to follow the principles of
the scriptures. There are different prescribed duties for persons in the
different social and spiritual orders. Here it is stated that performance of
fruitive activities and sacrifices and distribution of charity are activities
meant for persons who are in the householder order of society. There are
four orders of the social system: brahmacarya, grhastha, vanaprastha and
sannydsa. For the grhasthas, or householders, performance of sacrifices,
distribution of charity, and action according to prescribed duties are espe-
cially recommended. Similarly, austerity, study of Vedic literature, and
philosophical research are meant for the vanaprasthas, or retired persons.
Study of the Vedic literature from the bona fide spiritual master is meant
for the brahmacari, or student. Atmendriya-jaya, control of the mind and
taming of the scnscs, is meant for persons in the renounced order of life.


--- Page 405 ---
1406 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 32
All these different activities are prescribed for different persons so that they
may be elevated to the platform of self-realization and from there to Krsna
consciousness, devotional service.

The words bhakti-yogena caiva hi mean that whatever is to be performed,
as described in verse 34, whether yoga, or sacrifice, or fruitive activity, or
study of Vedic literature, or philosophical research, or acceptance of the
renounced order of life, is to be executed in bhakti-yoga. The words caiva
hi, according to Sanskrit grammar, indicate that one must perform all these
activities mixed with devotional service, otherwise such activities will not
produce any fruit. Any prescribed activity must be performed for the sake
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. 11 is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita,
yat karosi yad asnasi: “Whatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever you
sacrifice, whatever austerities you undergo and whatever charities you give,
the result should be given to the Supreme Lord.” The word eva is added, in-
dicating that one must execute activities in such a way. Unless one adds devo-
tional service to all activities, he cannot achieve the desired result, but when
bhakti-yoga is prominent in every activity, then the ultimate goal is sure.

One has to approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, as it
is stated in Bhagavad-gita: “After many, many births, one approaches
the Supreme Person, Krsna, and surrenders unto Him, knowing that He is
everything.” Also in Bhagavad-gita, the Lord says, bhoktaram yajiia-
tapasam: “For anyone who is undergoing rigid austerity or for anyone who
is performing different kinds of sacrifices, the beneficiary is the Supreme
Personality of Godhead.” He is the proprietor of all planets, and He is the
friend of every living soul.

The words dharmenobhaya-cihnena mean that the bhakti-yoga process
contains two symptoms, namely attachment for the Supreme Lord and
detachment from all material affinities. There are two symptoms of
advancement in the process of devotional service, just as there are two
processes taking place while eating. A hungry man feels strength and
satisfaction from eating, and at the same time he gradually becomes
detached from eating any more. Similarly, with the execution of devotional
service, real knowledge develops, and one becomes detached from all
material activities. In no other activity but devotional service is there such
detachment from matter and attachment for the Supreme. There are nine
different processes to increase this attachment to the Supreme Lord:
hearing, chanting, remembering, worshiping, serving the Lord, making
friendship, praying, offering everything, and serving the lotus feet of the
Lord. The processes for increasing detachment from material affinities arc
explained in verse 36.


--- Page 406 ---
Text 37] Entanglement in Fruitive Activities 1407

One can achieve elevation to the higher planetary systems like the
heavenly kingdom by executing one’s prescribed duties and by performing
sacrifices. When he is transcendental to such desires because of accepting
the renounced order of life, he can understand the Brahman feature of the
Supreme, and when one is able to see his real constitutional position, he
sees all other processes and becomes situated in the stage of pure devotional
service. At that time he can understand the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Bhagavan.

Understanding of the Supreme Person is called @tma-tattva-avabodhena,
which means understanding of one’s real constitutional position. If one
actually understands one’s constitutional position as an eternal servitor of
the Supreme Lord, he becomes detached from the service of the material
world. Everyone engages in some sort of service. If one does not know
one’s constitutional position, one engages in the service of his personal
gross body, or his family, society or country. But as soon as one is able
to see his constitutional position (the word sva-drk means one who is able
to see), he becomes detached from such material service and engages
himself in devotional service.

As long as one is in the modes of material nature and is performing the
duties prescribed in the scriptures, he can be elevated to higher planetary
systems where the predominating deities are material representations of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, like the sun-god, the moon-god, the air-
god, Brahma and Lord Siva. All the different demigods are material repre-
sentations of the Supreme Lord. By material activities one can only
approach such demigods, as stated in Bhagavad-gita. Yanti deva-vrata devin
(Bg. 9.25): those who are attached to the demigods and who perform the
prescribed duties can approach the abodes of the demigods. In this way,
one can go to the planet of the pitds, or forefathers. Similarly, one who
fully understands the real position of his life adopts devotional service and
realizes the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION
My dear mother, [ have explained to you the process of devotional
service and its identity in four different social divisions. I have explained
to you as well how eternal time is chasing the living entities, although it is
imperceptible to them.
PURPORT
The process of bhakti-yoga, devotional service, is the main river flowing
down towards the sea of the Absolute Truth, and all other processes men-
tioned are just like tributaries. Lord Kapila is summarizing the importance
of the process of devotional service. Bhakti-yoga, as described before, is
divided into four divisions, three in the material modes of nature and one
in transcendence, which is untinged by the modes of material nature.
Devotional service mixed with the modes of material nature is a means for
material existence, whereas devotional service without desires for fruitive
result and without attempts for empirical philosophical research is pure,
transcendental devotional service.

TRANSLATION
There are varieties of material existence for the living entity according to
the work he performs in ignorance or forgetfulness of his real identity. My
dear mother, if anyone enters into that forgetfulness, he is unable to
understand where his movements will end.
PURPORT
Once one enters into the continuation of material existence, it is very
difficult to get out. Therefore the Supreme Personality of Godhead comes
Himself or sends His bona fide representative, and He leaves behind scrip-
tures like Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam, so that the living entities
hovering in the darkness of nescience may take advantage of the instruc-
tions, the saintly persons and the spiritual masters and thus be freed. Unless
the living entity receives the mercy of the saintly persons, the spiritual
master or Krsna, it is not possible for him to get out of the darkness of
material existence; by his own endeavor it is not possible.

TRANSLATION

It is not to be instructed to persons who are too greedy and too attached
to family life, nor to persons who are nondevotees and who are envious of
the devotees and of the Personality of Godhead.

PURPORT

Persons who are always planning to do harm to other living entities are
not eligible to understand Krsna consciousness and cannot enter into the
realm of transcendental loving service to the Lord. Also, there are so-called
disciples who become submissive to a spiritual master most artificially,
with an ulterior motive. They also cannot understand what Krsna con-
sciousness or devotional service is. Persons who, due to being initiated by
another sect of religious faith, do not find devotional service as the
common platform for approaching the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
also cannot understand Krsna consciousness. We have experience that
some students come to join us, but because of being biased in some par-
ticular ty pe of faith, they leave our camp and become lost in the wilderness.
Actually, Krsna consciousness is not a sectarian religious faith; it is a
teaching process for understanding the Supreme Lord and our relationship
with Him. Anyone can join this movement without prejudice, but unfor-
tunately there are persons who feel differently. It is better, therefore, not
to instruct the science of Krsna consciousness unto such persons.

Generally, materialistic persons are after some name, fame and material
gain, so if someone takes to Krsna consciousness for these reasons, he will


--- Page 410 ---
Text 42] Entanglement in Fruitive Activities 1411
never be able to understand this philosophy. Such persons take to religious
principles as a social decoration. They admit themselves into some cultural
institution for the sake of name only, especially in this age. Such persons
also cannot understand the philosophy of Krsna consciousness. Even if one
is not greedy for material possessions but is too attached to family life, he
also cannot understand Krsna consciousness. Superficially such persons are
not very greedy for material possessions, but they are too attached to
wife, children and family improvement. When a person is not contaminated
by the above-mentioned faults yet at the ultimate issue is not interested
in the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or if he is a non-
devotee, he also cannot understand the philosophy of Krsna consciousness.

This instruction should be imparted by the spiritual master to persons
who have taken the Supreme Personality of Godhead to be more dear than
anything, who are not envious of anyone, who are perfectly cleansed and
who have developed detachment for that which is outside of the purview
of Krsna consciousness.

PURPORT

In the beginning, no one can be elevated to the highest stage of devo-
tional service. Here bhakta means one who does not hesitate to accept the
reformatory processes for becoming a bhakta. In order to become a devotee
of the Lord one has to accept a spiritual master and inquire from him about
how to progress in devotional service. To serve a devotee, to chant the holy
name according lo a certain counting method, to worship the Deity, to
hcar Srimad-Bhagavatam or Bhagavad-gita from a realized person and to
live in a sacred place where devotional service is not disturbed are the first
out of sixty-four devotional activities for making progress in devotional
service. One who has accepted these five chief activities is called a devotee.

One must be prepared to offer the necessary respect and honor to the
spiritual master. He should not be unnecessarily envious of his Godbrothers.
Rather, if a Godbrother is more cnlightened and advanced in Krsna con-
sciousness, onc should accept him as almost equal to the spiritual master,
and onc should be happy to see such Godbrothers advance in Krsna con-
sciousness. A devotee should always be very kind to the general public in
instructing Krsna consciousness because that is the only solution for getting
out of the clutches of maya. That is really humanitarian work, for it is the
way {0 show mercy to other people who need it very badly. The word
Susrusabhirataya indicates a person who faithfully engages in serving the
spiritual master. One should give personal service and all kinds of comforts
to the spiritual master. A devotee who does so is also a bona fide candi-
date for taking this instruction. The word bahir-jata-viragaye means a person
who has developed detachment from external and internal material pro-
pensities. Not only is he detached from activities which are not connected
to Krsna consciousness, but he should be internally averse to the material
way of life. Such a person must be nonenvious and should think of the
welfare of all living entities, not only of the human beings, but living


--- Page 412 ---
Text 43] Entanglement in Fruitive Activities 1413
entities other than human beings. The word sucaye means one who is
cleansed both externally and internally. To become actually cleansed
externally and internally, one should chant the holy name of the Lord,
Hare Krsna, or Vignu, constantly.

The word diyatim means that knowledge of Krsna consciousness should
be offered by the spiritual master. The spiritual master must not accept a
disciple who is not qualified; he should not be professional and should
nol accept disciples for monetary gains. The bona fide spiritual master
musl see the bona fide qualities of a person whom he is going to initiate.
An unworthy person should not be initiated. The spiritual master should
train his disciple in such a way so that in the future only the Supreme
Personality of Godhead will be the dearmost goal of his life.

In these two verses the qualities of a devotee are fully explained. One
who has actually developed all the qualities listed in these verses is already
elevated to the post of a devotee. If one has not developed all these quali-
ties, he still has to fulfill these conditions in order to become a perfect
devotee.

TRANSLATION

Anyone who once meditates upon Me with faith and affection, who
hears and chants about Me, surely goes back home, back to Godhead.

Sri Maitreya said: Thus Devahiti, the mother of Lord Kapila and wife of
Kardama Muni, became freed from all ignorance concerning devotional
service and transcendental knowledge. She offered her obeisances unto the
Lord, the author of the basic principles of the sankhya system of philoso-

phy, which is the background of liberation, and she satsified Him with the
following verses of prayer.
PURPORT
The system of philosophy enunciated by Lord Kapila before His mother
is the background for situation on the spiritual platform. The specific
significance of this system of philosophy is stated herein as siddhi-
bhumim—it is the background of salvation. People who are suffering in
this material world because they are conditioned by the material energy
can easily get freedom from the clutches of matter by understanding the
sankhya philosophy enunciated by Lord Kapila. By this system of philoso-
phy, one can immediately become free, even though one is situated in
this material world. That stage is called jivan-mukti. This means that one is
liberated even though one stays with his material body. That happened for
Devahuti, the mother of Lord Kapila, and she therefore satisfied the Lord
by offering her prayers. Anyone who understands the basic principle of
sankhya philosophy is elevated in devotional service and becomes fully
Krsna conscious or liberated, even within this material world.

TRANSLATION

Devahuti said: Brahma is said to be unborn because he takes birth from
the lotus flower which grows from Your abdomen while You lie in the
ocean at the bottom of the universe. But even Brahma simply meditated
upon You, whose body is the source of unlimited universes.

PURPORT

Brahma’s name is Aja, he who is unborn. Whenever we think of
someone’s birth, there must be a material father and mother, for thus one
is born. But Brahma, being the first living creature within this universe, was
born directly from the body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead who
is known as Garbhodakasayi Visnu, the Visnu form lying down in the
ocean at the bottom of the universe. Devahiiti wanted to impress upon the
Lord that when Brahma wants to see Him, he has to meditate upon Him.
“You are the seed of all creation,” she said. ‘“‘Although Brahma was
directly born from You, he still has to perform many years of meditation,
and even then he cannot see You directly, face to face. Your body is lying
within the vast water at the bottom of the universe, and thus You are
known as Garbhodakasayi Visnu.”

The nature of the Lord's gigantic body is also explained in this verse.
That body is transcendental, untouched by matter. Since the material
manifestation has come from His body, His body therefore existed before
the material creation. The conclusion is that the transcendental body of
Vignu is not made of material elements. The body of Visnu is the source
of all other living entities, as well as the material nature, which is also sup-
posed to be the energy of that Supreme Personality of Godhead. Devahati
said, “You are the background of the material manifestation and all
created energy; therefore Your delivering me from the clutches of maya
by explaining the system of sankhya philosophy is not so astonishing. But
Y our beingborn from my abdomen is certainly wonderful because although
You are the source of all creation, You have so kindly taken birth as my
child. That is most wonderful. Your body is the source of all the universe,


--- Page 416 ---
1418 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 33
and still You put Your body within the abdomen of a common woman like
me. To me, that is most astonishing.”

TRANSLATION
My dear Lord, although personally You have nothing to do, You have
distributed Your energies in the interactions of the material modes of
nature, and for that reason the creation, maintenance and dissolution of
the cosmic manifestation take place. My dear Lord, You are self-determined
and are the Supreme Personality of Godhead for all living entities. For
them You created this material manifestation, and although You are one,
Your diverse energies can act multifariously. This 18 inconceivable to us.
PURPORT
The statement made in this verse by Bevahiiti that the Absolute Truth
has many diverse energies although He personally has nothing to do is
confirmed in the Upanigsads. There is no one greater than Him or on an
equal level with Him, and everything is completely done by His energy, as
if by nature. It is understood herein, therefore, that the modes of material
nature are entrusted to different manifestations like Brahma, Visnu and Siva.


--- Page 417 ---
Text 4] Activities of Kapila 1419
Each one of them is particularly invested with different kinds of power,
but the Supreme Lord is completely aloof from such activities. Devahuti
is saying, “Although You personally are not doing anything, Your deter-
mination is absolute. There is no question of Your fulfilling Your will with
the help of anyone else besides Yourself. You are, in the end, the Supreme
Soul and the supreme controller. Your will, therefore, cannot be checked
by anyone else.” The Supreme Lord can check others’ plans. As it is
said, “Man proposes and God disposes.” But when the Supreme Personality
of Godhead proposes, that desire is under no one else’s control. He is
absolute. We are ultimately dependent on Him to fulfill our desires, but
we cannot say that God’s desires are also dependent. That is His incon-
ceivable power. That which may be inconceivable by ordinary living
entities is easily done by Him. And in spite of His being unlimited, He has
subjected Himself to being known from the authoritative scriptures like the
Vedic literatures. As it is said, Sabda-milatvat: He can be known through
the $abda-brahman, or Vedic literature.

Why is the creation made? Since the Lord is the Supreme Personality of
Godhead for all living entities, He created this material manifestation for
those living entities who want to enjoy or lord it over material nature. As
the Supreme Godhead, He arranges to fulfill their various desires. It is
confirmed also in the Vedas, eko bahunam yo vidadhati kaman: the
Supreme One supplies the necessities of the many living entities. There is
no limit to the demands of the different kinds of living entities, and the
Supreme One, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, alone maintains them
and supplies them by His inconceivable energy.

TRANSLATION

As the Supreme Personality of Godhead, You have taken birth from
my abdomen. O my Lord, how is that possible for the Supreme One, who
has in His belly all the cosmic manifestation? The answer is that it is
possible, for at the end of the millennium You lie down on a leaf of a
banyan tree, and just like a small baby, You lick the toe of Your lotus foot.

PURPORT

At the time of dissolution the Lord sometimes appears as a small baby
lying on a leaf of a banyan tree, floating on the devastating water. There-
fore Devahiiti suggests, “Your lying down within the abdomen of a
common woman like me is not so astonishing. You can lie down on the
leaf of a banyan tree and float on the water of devastation as a small baby.
It is not very wonderful, therefore, that You can lie down in the abdomen
of my body. You teach us that those who are very fond of children within
this material world and who therefore enter into marriage to enjoy family
life with children can also have the Supreme Personality of Godhead as
their child, and the most wonderful thing is that the Lord Himself licks
His toe.”

Since all the great sages and devotees apply all energy and all activities
in the service of the lotus feet of the Lord, there must be some transcen-
dental pleasure in the toes of His lotus feet. The Lord licks His toe to
taste the nectar for which the devotees always aspire. Sometimes the
Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself wonders how much transcen-
dental pleasure is within Himself, and in order to taste His own potency,
He sometimes takes the position of tasting Himself. Lord Caitanya is
Krsna Himself, but He appears as a devotee to taste the sweetness of the
transcendental mellow in Himself which is tasted by Srimati Radharani,
the greatest of all devotees.

TRANSLATION
My dear Lord, You have assumed this body in order to diminish the
sinful activities of the fallen and to enrich their knowledge in devotion
and liberation. Since these sinful people are dependent on Your direction,
by Your own will You assume incarnations as a boar and as other forms.
Similarly, You have appeared in order to distribute transcendental knowl-
edge to Your dependents.
PURPORT
In the previous verses, the general transcendental qualifications of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead were described. Now the specific purpose
of the Lord’s appearance is also described. By His different energies He
bestows different kinds of bodies upon the living entities who are con-
ditioned by their propensity to lord it over material nature, but in course
of time these living entities become so degraded that they need enlighten-
ment. It is stated in Bhagavad-gita that whenever there are discrepancies
in the discharge of the real purpose of this material existence, the Lord
appears as an incarnation. The Lord’s form as Kapila directs the fallen
souls and enriches them with knowledge and devotion so that they may
go back to Godhead. There are many incarnations of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, like those of the boar, the fish, the tortoise, and
the half-man half-lion. Lord Kapiladeva is also one of the incarnations of
Godhead. It is accepted herein that Lord Kapiladeva appeared on the
surface of the earth to give transcendental knowledge to the misguided
conditioned souls.

TRANSLATION

To say nothing of the spiritual advancement of persons who see the
Supreme Person eye to eye, even a person born in the family of dog-eaters
immediately becomes eligible to perform Vedic sacrifices if he once utters
the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or chants about
Him, hears about His pastimes, offers Him obeisances or even remembers
Him.

PURPORT

Herein the spiritual potency of chanting, hearing or remembering the
holy name of the Supreme Lord is greatly stressed. Ripa Gosvami has
discussed the sequence of sinful activities of the conditioned soul, and he
has established, in Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu, that those who engage in
devotional service become freed from the reactions of all sinful activities.
This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita. The Lord says that le takes
charge of one who surrenders unto Him, and He makes him immune to all
reactions to sinful activities. If by chanting the holy name of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead one becomes so swiftly cleared of all reactions to


--- Page 421 ---
Text 6] Activities of Kapila 1423
sinful activities, then what is to be said of those persons who see Him
face to face?

Another consideration here is that persons who are purified by the
process of chanting and hearing become immediately eligible to perform
Vedic sacrifices. Generally, only a person who is born in a family of
brahmanas, who has been reformed by the ten kinds of purificatory
processes, and who is learned in Vedic literature is allowed to perform
the Vedic sacrifices. But here the word sadyah, “immediately,” is used,
and Sridhara Svami also remarks that one can immediately become
eligible to perform Vedic sacrifices. A person born in a family of the low
caste which is accustomed to eat dogs is so positioned due to his
past sinful activities, but by chanting or hearing once in pureness or in an
offenseless manner, he is immediately relieved of the sinful reaction. Not
only is he relieved of the sinful reaction, but immediately he achieves the
result of all purificatory processes. Taking birth in the family of a
brahmana is certainly due to pious activities in one’s past life. But still a
child who is born in a family of a brahmana depends for his further
reformation upon initiation into acceptance of a sacred thread and many
other reformatory processes. But a person who chants the holy name of
the Lord, even if born in a family of canpdalas, dog-eaters, does not need
reformation. Simply by chanting Hare Krsna, he immediately becomes
purified and becomes as good as the most learned brahmana.

Sridhara Svami especially remarks in this connection, anena pitjyatvam
lakgyate. Some caste brahmapas remark that by chanting Hare Krsna,
purification begins. Of course, that depends on the individual process of
chanting, but this remark of Sridhara Svami’s is completely applicable if
one chants the holy name of the Lord without offense, for he immediately
becomes more than a brahmapa. As Sridhara Svami says, piijyatvam: he
immediately becomes as respectable as a most learned brahmana and can
be allowed to perform Vedic sacrifices. If by simply chanting the holy
name of the Lord one becomes sanctified instantly, then what can be said
of those persons who see the Supreme Lord face to face and who under-
stand the descent of the Lord as Devahiiti understands Kapiladeva.

Usually, initiation depends on the bona fide spiritual master, who
directs the disciple. If he sees that a disciple has become competent and
purified by the process of chanting, then he offers the sacred thread to
the disciple just so that he will be recognized as one hundred percent
equal with a brahmapa. This is also confirmed in the Hari-bhakti-vilasa by
Sri Sanatana Gosvami: “As a base metal like bell metal can be changedinto
gold by a chemical process, similarly any person can be changed into a
brahmana by diksd-vidhana, the initiation process.”


--- Page 422 ---
1424 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 33
It is sometimes remarked that by the chanting process one begins to
purify himself and can take birth in his next life in a brahmana family
and then be reformed. But at this present moment, even those who are
born in the best brahmana families are not reformed, nor is there any
certainty that they are actually born of brahmapa fathers. Formerly the
garbhadhana reformatory system was prevalent, but at the present moment
there is no such garbhadhana, or seed-giving ceremony. Under these
circumstances no one knows if a man is factually born of a brahmapa
father. Whether one has acquired the qualification of a brahmana depends
on the judgement of the bona fide spiritual master. He bestows upon the
disciple the position of a brahmanae by his own judgement. When one is
accepted as a brahmapa in the sacred thread ceremony, under the
paiicaratric system, then he is dvija, twice-born. That is confirmed by
Sanatana Gosvami: 0011৫60৫177, jayate. By the process of initiation by the
spiritual master, a person is accepted as a brahmapa in his purified state of
chanting the holy name of the Lord. He then makes further progress to
become a qualified Vaisnava, which means that the brahminical qualifica-
tion is already acquired.

TRANSLATION

Oh how glorious are they whose tongues are chanting Your holy name!
Even if born in the families of dog-eaters, such persons are worshipable.
Persons who chant the holy name of Your Lordship must have executed
all kinds of austerities and fire sacrifices and achieved all the good manners
of the Aryans. To be chanting the holy name of Your Lordship, they
must have bathed at holy places of pilgrimage, studied the Vedas and
fulfilled everything required.

PURPORT

As it is stated in the previous verse, a person who has once offenselessly
chanted the holy name of God becomes immediately eligible to perform
Vedic sacrifices. One should not be astonished by this statement of
Srimad-Bhagavatam. One should not disbelieve or think, “How by chanting
the holy name of the Lord can one become a holy man to be compared
with the most elevated brahmana?”’ To eradicate such doubts in the
minds of unbelievers, this verse affirms that the stage of chanting of the
holy name of the Lord is not sudden, but that the chanters have already
performed all kinds of Vedic rituals and sacrifices. It is not very astound-
ing because no one in this life can chant the holy name of the Lord
unless he has passed all lower stages, such as performing the Vedic
ritualistic sacrifices, studying the Vedas and practicing good behavior like
that of the Aryans. All this must first have been done. Just as a student
in a law class is 10 be understood to have already graduated from general
education, so anyone who is engaged in the chanting of the holy name of
the Lord, Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama,
Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, must have already passed all lower
stages. It is said that those who simply chant the holy name with the tip of
the tongue are glorious. One does not even have to chant the holy name
and understand the whole procedure, namely the offensive stage, offense-
less stage and pure stage; if the holy name is sounded on the tip of the
tongue, ‘that is also sufficient. It is said herein that nama, a singular
number, one name, Krsna or Rama, is sufficient. It is not that one has to
chant all the holy names of the Lord. The holy names of the Lord are
innumerable, and one does not have to chant all the names to prove that
he has already undergone all the processes of Vedic ritualistic ceremonies.
If one chants once only, it is to be understood that he has already passed
all the examinations, not to speak of those who are chanting always,


--- Page 424 ---
1426 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3; Ch. 33

twenty-four hours a day. It is specifically said here, tubhyam: “unto You
only.” One must chant God’s name, not, as the Mayavadi philosophers
say, any name, such as a demigod’s name or the names of God’s energies.
Only the holy name of the Supreme Lord will be effective. Anyone who
compares the holy name of the Supreme Lord to the names of the
demigods is called pasandi, or an offender.

The holy name has to be chanted to please the Supreme Lord, and not
for any sense gratification or professional purpose. If this pure mentality
is there, then even though a person is born of a low family, such as a dog-
eater’s, he is so glorious that not only has he purified himself, but he is
quite competent to deliver others. He is competent to speak on the
importance of the transcendental name, just as Thakura Haridasa did. He
was apparently born in a family of Mohammedans, but because he was
chanting the holy name of the Supreme Lord offenselessly, Lord Caitanya
empowered him to become the authority or dcarya of spreading the name.
It didn’t matter that he was born in a family which was not following the
Vedic rules and regulations. Caitanya Mahaprabhu and Advaita Prabhu
accepted him as an authority because he was offenselessly chanting the
name of the Lord. Authorities like Advaita Prabhu and Lord Caitanya
immediately accepted that he had already performed all kinds of
austerities, studied the Vedas and performed all sacrifices. That is
automatically understood. There is a hereditary class of 07৫117৫18৫5 called
the smarta-brahmanpas, however, who are of the opinion that even if such
persons who are chanting the holy name of the Lord are accepted as
purified, they still have to perform the Vedic rites or await their next
birth in a family of brahmanas so that they can perform the Vedic rituals.
But actually that is not the case. Such a man does not need to wait for the
next birth to become purified. He is at once purified. It is understood
that he has already performed all sorts of rites. It is the so-called
brahmanas who actually have to undergo different kinds of austerities
before reaching that point of purification. There are many other Vedic
performances which are not described here. All such Vedic rituals have
been already performed by the chanters of the holy name.

The word juhuvuh means that the chanters of the holy name have
already performed all kinds of sacrifices. Sasnuh means that they have
already traveled to all the holy places of pilgrimage and taken part in
purificatory activities at those places. They are called aryah because they
have already finished all these requirements, and therefore they must be
among the Aryans or those who have qualified themselves to become Aryans.
Aryan refers to those who are civilized, whose manners are regulated


--- Page 425 ---
Text 8] Activities of Kapila 1427
according to the Vedic rituals. Any devotee who is chanting the holy
name of the Lord is the best kind of Aryan. Unless one studies the Vedas,
one cannot become an Aryan, but it is automatically understood that the
chanters have already studied all the Vedic literature. The specific word
used here is aniicuh, which means that because they have already completed
all those recommended acts, they have become qualified to be spiritual
masters.

The very word grnanti, which is used in this verse, means to be
already established in the perfectional stage of ritualistic performances.
If one is seated on the bench of a high court and is giving judgement on
cases, it means that he has already passed all legal exams and is better than
those who are engaged in the study of law or those who are expecting to
study law in the future. In a similar way, persons who are chanting the
holy name are transcendental to those who are factually performing the
Vedic rituals and those who expect to be qualified (or, in other words,
those who are born in families of brahmanas but have not yet undergone
the reformatory processes and who therefore expect to study the Vedic
rituals and perform the sacrifices in the future).

There are many Vedic versions in different places saying that anyone
who chants the holy name of the Lord becomes immediately freed from
conditional life and that anyone who hears the holy name of the Lord,
even though born of a family of dog-eaters, also becomes liberated from
the clutches of material entanglement.

Devahiiti, the mother of Kapila, instead of prolonging her prayers,
summarized that Lord Kapila was none other than Vignu and that since
she was a woman it was not possible for her to worship Him properly
simply by prayer. It was her intention that the Lord should be satisfied.
The word pratyak is significant. In yogic practice, the eight divisions are
yama, niyama, dsana, pranayama, pratyahdara, dharapd, dhyana, and
samadhi. Pratyahara means to wind up the activities of the senses. The
level of realization of the Supreme Lord evidenced by Devahiiti is possible
when one is able to withdraw the senses from material activities. When
one is engaged in devotional service, there is no scope for his senses to be
engaged otherwise. In such full Krsna consciousness, one can understand
the Supreme Lord as He is.

1430 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 33
PURPORT

Devotional service is so perfect that simply by following the rules and
regulations and executing them under the direction of the spiritual
master, one is liberated, as it is said herein, from the clutches of maya,
even in this body. In other yogic processes, or in empiric philosophical
speculation, one is never certain whether or not he is at the perfectional
stage. But in the discharge of devotional service, if one has unflinching
faith in the instruction of the bona fide spiritual master and follows the
rules and regulations, he is sure to be liberated, even within this present
body. Srila Ripa Gosvami, in the Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu, has also
confirmed this. Tha yasya harer dasye: anyone whose only aim is to serve
the Supreme Lord under the direction of the spiritual master, regardless
of where he is situated, is called jivan-mukta, or one who is liberated
even with his material body. Sometimes doubts arise in the minds of
neophytes about whether or not the spiritual master is liberated, and
sometimes neophytes are doubtful about the bodily affairs of the
spiritual master. The point of liberation, however, is not to see the
bodily symptoms of the spiritual master. One has to see the spiritual
symptoms of the spiritual master. Jivan-mukta means that even though
one is in the material body (there are still some material necessities,
since the body is material), because one is fully situated in the service of
the Lord, he is to be understood to be liberated.

Liberation entails being situated in one’s own position. That is the
definition in the Srimad-Bhdgavatam: muktir. . . 50010106180 vyavasthitih.
The svariipa, or actual identity of the living entity, is described by Lord
Caitanya. Jivera ‘svaripa’ haya—krsnera ‘nitya-dasa’: the real identity of
the living entity is that he is eternally a servitor of the Supreme Lord. If
someone is one hundred percent engaged in the service of the Lord, he is
to be understood as liberated. One must understand whether or not he is
liberated by his activities in devotional service, not by other symptoms.

My dear mother, those who are actually transcendentalists certainly
follow My instructions, as I have given them to you. You may rest
assured that if you traverse this path of self-realization perfectly, surely
you shall be freed from fearful material contamination and shall ultimately
reach Me. Mother, persons who are not conversant with this method of
devotional service certainly cannot get out of the cycle of birth and
death.
PURPORT
Material existence is full of anxiety, and therefore it is fearful. One
who gets out of this material existence automatically becomes free from
all anxieties and fear. One who follows the path of devotional service
enunciated by Lord Kapila is very easily liberated.

TRANSLATION

Si Maitreya said: The Supreme Personality of Godhead Kapila, after
instructing His beloved mother, took permission from her and left His
home, His mission having been fulfilled.

PURPORT

The mission of the appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead
in the form of Kapila was to distribute the transcendental knowledge of
sankhya philosophy, which is full of devotional service. Having imparted
that knowledge to His mother—and, through His mother, to the world—
Kapiladeva had no more need to stay at home, so He took permission from
His mother and left. Apparently He left home for spiritual realization,
although He had nothing to realize spiritually because He Himself is the
person to be spiritually realized. Therefore this is an example set by the
Supreme Personality of Godhead while acting like an ordinary human
being so that others might learn from Him. He could, of course, have
stayed with His mother, but He indicated that there was no need to stay
with the family. It is best to remain alone as a brahmacadri, sannydasi or
vanaprastha and cultivate Krsna consciousness throughout one’s whole
life. Those who are unable to remain alone are given license to live in
household life with wife and children, not for sense gratification but for
cultivation of Krsna consciousness.

TRANSLATION
As instructed by her son, Devahiiti also began to practice bhakti-yoga in
that very asrama. She practiced samadhi in the house of Kardama Muni,
which was so beautifully decorated with flowers that it was considered to
be the flower crown of the River Sarasvati.
PURPORT
Devahiiti did not leave her house, because it is never recommended for a
woman to leave her home. She is dependent. The very example of Devahuti
was that when she was not married, she was under the care of her father,
Svayambhuva Manu, and then Svayambhuva Manu gave her to Kardama
Muni in charity. She was under the care of her husband in her youth, and
then her son Kapila Muni was born. As soon as her son grew up, her
husband left home, and similarly the son, after discharging His duty
towards His mother, also left. She could also have left home, but she did
not. Rather, she remained at home and began to practice bhakti-yoga as it
was instructed by her great son, Kapila Muni, and because of her practice
of bhakti-yoga, the entire home became just like a flower crown on the
River Sarasvati.

--- Page 432 ---
1434 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3. Ch. 33
PURPORT

It is the practice of the yogi, brahmacdri, vanaprastha and sannyasi to
bathe at least three times daily—early in the morning, during noontime
and in the evening. These principles are strictly followed even by some
grhasthas, especially brahmanas, who are elevated in spiritual conscious-
ness. Devahiiti was a king's daughter and almost a kings wife also.
Although Kardama Muni was not a king, by his yogic mystic power he
accommodated Devahiiti very comfortably in a nice palace with maid-
servants and all opulence. But since she had learned austerity even in the
presence of her husband, there was no difficulty for her to be austere.
Still, because her body underwent severe austerity after the departure of
her husband and son, she became thin. To be too fat is not very good for
spiritually advanced life. Rather, one should reduce because if one becomes
fat it is an impediment to progress in spiritual understanding. One should
be careful not to eat too much, sleep too much or remain in a comfortable
position. Voluntarily accepting some penances and difficulties, one should
take less food and less sleep. These are the procedures for practicing any
kind of yoga, whether bhakti-yoga, jiiana-yoga or hatha-yoga.

of austerity and yoga, that his opulence was sometimes envied by those
who travel in outer space in airplanes.


--- Page 433 ---
Text 16] Activities of Kapila 1435
PURPORT

The statement in this verse that Kardama Muni’s household affairs were
envied even by persons who travel in outer space refers to the denizens of
heaven. Their airships are not like those we have invented in the modern
age, which fly only from one country to another; their airplanes were
capable of going from one planet to another. There are many such
statements in the Srimad-Bhagavatam from which we can understand that
there were facilities to travel from one planet to another, especially in the
higher planetary system, and who can say that they are not still traveling?
The speed of our airplanes and space vehicles is very limited, but, as we
have already studied, Kardama Muni traveled in outer space in an airplane
which was like a city, and he journeyed to see all the different heavenly
planets. That was not an ordinary airplane, nor was it ordinary space
travel. Because Kardama Muni was such a powerful mystic yogi, his
opulence was envied by the denizens of heaven.

The walls of the house were made of first-class marble, decorated with
valuable jewels. There was no need of light, for the household was
illuminated by the rays of these jewels. The female members of the
household were all amply decorated with jewelry.
PURPORT
It is understood from this statement that the opulences of household
life were exhibited in valuable jewels, ivory, first-class marble and furni-
ture made of gold and jewels. The clothes are also mentioned as being
decorated with golden filigree. Everything actually had some value. It was
not like the furniture of the present day, which is cast in valueless plastic
or base metal. The way of Vedic civilization is that whatever was used in
household affairs had to be valuable. In case of need, such items of value
could be exchanged immediately. Thus one’s broken and unwanted furni-
ture and paraphernalia would never be without value. This system is still
followed by Indians in household affairs. They keep metal utensils and
golden ornaments or silver plates and valuable silk garments with gold
embroidery, and in case of need, they can have some money in exchange
immediately. There are exchanges for the money lenders and the house-
holders.

When Devahiiti would enter that lovely garden to take her bath in the

great husband, Kardama, gave her all protection at all times.


--- Page 436 ---
1438 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 33
PURPORT
The ideal husband and wife relationship is very nicely described in this
statement. Kardama Muni gave Devahiiti all sorts of comforts in his duty
as a husband, but he was not at all attached to his wife. As soon as his son
Kapiladeva was grown up, Kardama at once left all family connection.
Similarly, Devahiiti was the daughter of a great king, Svayambhuva Manu,
and was qualified and beautiful, but she was completely dependent on the
protection of her husband. According to Manu, women, the fair sex,
should not have independence at any stage of life. In childhood a woman
must be under the protection of the parents, in youth she must be under
the protection of the husband, and in old age she must be under the
protection of the grown-up children. Devahiiti demonstrated all these
statements of the Manu-samhitd in her life: as a child she was dependent
on her father, later she was dependent on her husband, in spite of her
opulence, and she was later on dependent on her son Kapiladeva.

ladies of the heavenly planets, gave up all such comforts. She was only
sorry that her great son was separated from her.


--- Page 437 ---
Text 21] Activities of Kapila 1439
PURPORT
Devahiiti was not at all sorry at giving up her material comforts, but she
was very much aggrieved at the separation of her son. It may be ques-
tioned here that if Devahiiti was not at all sorry to give up the material
comforts of life, then why was she sorry about losing her son? Why was
she so attached to her son? The answer is explained in the next verse. He
was not an ordinary son. Her son was the Supreme Personality of God-
head. One can give up material attachment, therefore, only when one has
attachment for the Supreme Person. This is explained in Bhagavad-gita.
Parari drstva nivartate. Only when one actually has some taste for spiritual
existence can he be reluctant to follow the materialistic way of life.

TRANSLATION
Devahiiti’s husband had already left home and accepted the renounced
order of life, and then her only son, Kapila, left home. Although she knew
all the truths of life and death, and although her heart was cleansed of all
dirt, she was very aggrieved at the loss of her son, just as a cow is affected
when her calf dies.
PURPORT
A woman whose husband is away from home or has taken the re-
nounced order of life should not be very sorry, because she still has the
presence of her husband’s representative, her son. It is said in the Vedic


--- Page 438 ---
1440 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 33
scriptures, dtmaiva putro jayate: the husband’s body is represented by
the son. Strictly speaking, a woman is never widowed if she has a grown-up
son. Devahiiti was not very much affected while Kapila Muni was there,
but upon His departure she was very afflicted. She grieved not because
of her worldly relationship with Kardama Muni but because of her
sincere love for the Personality of Godhead.

The example given here is that Devahiti became just like a cow who
has lost her calf. A cow bereft of her calf cries day and night. Similarly,
Devahiiti was aggrieved, and she always cried and requested her friends
and relatives, “Please bring my son home so that I may live. Otherwise, 1
shall die.” This intense affection for the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
although manifested as affection for one’s son, is spiritually beneficial.
Attachment for a material son obliges one to remain in material existence,
but the same attachment, when transferred to the Supreme Lord, brings
one elevation to the spiritual world in the association of the Lord.

Every woman can qualify herself as much as Devahuti and then can
also have the Supreme Godhead as her son. If the Supreme Personality of
Godhead can appear as the son of Devahiiti, He can also appear as the son
of any other woman, provided that woman is qualified. If one gets the
Supreme Lord as a son, he can have the benefit of bringing up a nice son
in this world and at the same time get promotion to the spiritual world to
become the face-to-face associate of the Personality of Godhead.

Text 23] Activities of Kapila 1441
TRANSLATION

O Vidura, thus always meditating upon her son, the Supreme Person-
ality of Godhead Kapiladeva, she very soon became unattached to her
nicely decorated home.

PURPORT

Here is a practical example of how one can elevate oneself in spiritual
advancement by Krsna consciousness. Kapiladeva is Krsna, and He ap-
peared as the son of Devahiiti. After Kapiladeva left home, Devahiiti was
absorbed in thought of Him, and thus she was always Krsna conscious.
Her constant situation in Krsna consciousness enabled her to be detached
from hearth and home.

Unless we are able to transfer our attachment to the Supreme Person-
ality of Godhead, there is no possibility of becoming freed from material
attachment. The Srimad-Bhagavatam, therefore, confirms that it is not
possible for one to become liberated by cultivation of empiric philosophi-
cal speculation. Simply knowing that one is not matter but spirit soul, or
Brahman, does not purify one’s intelligence. Even if the impersonalist
reaches the highest platform of spiritual realization, he falls down again
to material attachment because of not being situated in the transcendental
loving service of the Supreme Lord.

The devotees adopt the devotional process, hearing about the Supreme
Lord’s pastimes and glorifying His activities and thereby always remember-
ing His beautiful eternal form. By rendering service, becoming His friend
or His servant and offering Him everything that one possesses, one is able
to enter into the kingdom of God. As it is said in Bhagavad-gita, tato mar
tattvato jRdatva: after discharging pure devotional service, one can under-
stand the Supreme Personality of Godhead in fact, and thus one becomes
eligible to enter into His association in one of the spiritual planets.

TRANSLATION
Her mind became completely engaged in the Supreme Lord, and she
automatically realized the knowledge of the impersonal Brahman. As a
Brahman realized soul, she was freed from the designations of the
materialistic concept of life. Thus all material pangs disappeared, and she
attained transcendental bliss.
PURPORT
The previous verse states that Devahiiti was already conversant with the
Absolute Truth. It may be questioned why she was meditating. The
explanation is that when one theoretically discusses the Absolute Truth
he becomes situated in the impersonal concept of Absolute Truth.
Similarly, when one seriously discusses the subject matter of the form,
quality, pastimes and entourage of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,


--- Page 442 ---
1444 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 33
he becomes situated in meditation on Him. If one has complete knowledge
of the Supreme Lord, then knowledge of the impersonal Brahman is
automatically realized. The Absolute Truth is realized by the knower
according to three different angles of vision, namely impersonal Brahman,
localized Supersoul and ultimately the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
If one is situated, therefore, in knowledge of the Supreme Person, this
implies that one is already situated in the concept of the Supersoul and
impersonal Brahman.

In Bhagavad-gita it is said, brahma-bhiitah prasannatma. This means that
unless one is freed from the material entanglement and situated in
Brahman, there is no question of entering into the understanding of
devotional service or engaging in Krsna consciousness. One who is engaged
in devotional service to Krsna is understood to be already realized in the
Brahman concept of life because transcendental knowledge of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead includes knowledge of Brahman. This is confirmed
in Bhagavad-gita. Brahmano hi pratisthaham: the concept of the Person-
ality of Godhead does not depend on Brahman. The Vispu Purape also
confirms that one who has taken shelter of the all-auspicious Supreme
Lord is already situated in the understanding of Brahman. In other words,
one who is a Vaisnava is already a brahmana.

Another significant point of this verse is that one has to observe the
prescribed rules and regulations. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita, yuktahara-
viharasya. When one engages in devotional service in Krsna consciousness,
he still has to eat, sleep, defend and mate because these are necessities of
the body. But he performs such activities in a regulated way. He has to eat
krsna-prasida. He has to sleep according to regulated principles. The
principle is to reduce the duration of sleep and to reduce eating, taking
only what is needed to keep the body fit. In short, the goal is spiritual
advancement, not sense gratification. Similarly, sex life must be reduced.
Sex life is meant only for begetting Krsna conscious children. Otherwise,
there is no necessity for sex life. Nothing is prohibited, but everything is
made yukta, regulated, with the higher purpose always in mind. By
following all these rules and regulations of living, one becomes purified,
and all misconceptions due to ignorance become nil. It is specifically
mentioned here that the causes of material entanglement are completely
vanquished.

The Sanskrit statement anartha-nivrtti indicates that this body is
unwanted. We are spirit soul, and there was never any need of this material
body. But because we wanted to enjoy the material body, we therefore
have this body, through the material energy, under the direction of the


--- Page 443 ---
Text 26] Activities of Kapila 1445
Supreme Personality of Godhead. As soon as we are reestablished in our
original position of servitorship to the Supreme Lord, we begin to forget
the necessities of the body, and at last we forget the body.

Sometimes in a dream we get a particular type of body with which to
work in the dream. I may dream that I am flying in the sky or that I have
gone into the forest or some unknown place. But as soon as I am awake 1
forget all these bodies. Similarly, when one is Krsna conscious, fully
devoted, he forgets all his changes of body. We are always changing bodies,
beginning at birth from the womb of our mother. But when we are
awakened to Krspa consciousness we forget all these bodies. The bodily
necessities become secondary, for the primary necessity is the engagement
of the soul in real spiritual life. The activities of devotional service in full
Krsna consciousness are the cause of our being situated in transcendence.
The words bhagavaty atma-samsraye denote the Personality of Godhead as
the Supreme Soul, or the soul of everyone. In Bhagavad-gita Krsna says,
bijarh mar sarva-bhutanam: “1 am the seed of all entities.” By taking
shelter of the Supreme Being by the process of devotional service, one
becomes fully situated in the concept of the Personality of Godhead. As
described by Kapila, mad-gunae-sruti-mdtrena: one who is fully Krsna
conscious, situated in the Personality of Godhead, is immediately satu-
rated with love of God as soon as he hears about the transcendental
qualities of the Lord.

Devahiiti was fully instructed by her son Kapiladeva on how to concen-
trate her mind on the Visnu form in full detail. Following the instructions
of her son in the matter of devotional service, she contemplated the form
of the Lord within herself with great devotional love. That is the perfec-
tion of Brahman realization, or the mystic yoga system or devotional
service. At the ultimate issue, when one is fully absorbed in thought of the
Supreme Lord and meditates on Him constantly, that is the highest
perfection. Bhagavad-gita confirms that one who is always absorbed in
such a way is to be considered the topmost yogi.

The real purpose of all processes of transcendental realization—jiana-
yoga, dhyana-yoga or bhakti-yoga—is to arrive at the point of devotional
service. If one endeavors simply to achieve knowledge of the Absolute
Truth or the Supersoul but has no devotional service, then he labors
without gaining the real result. This is compared to beating the husks of
wheat after the grains have already been removed. Unless one understands
the Supreme Personality of Godhead to be the ultimate goal, it is valueless
simply to speculate or perform mystic yoga practice. In the astanga-yoga
system, the seventh stage of perfection is dhydna. This dhydna is the


--- Page 444 ---
1446 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 33
third stage in devotional service. There are nine stages of devotional service.
The first is hearing, and then comes chanting and then contemplating. By
executing devotional service, therefore, one automatically becomes an
expert jiani and an expert yogi. In other words, jiana and yoga are
different preliminary stages of devotional service.

Devahiiti was expert in accepting the real substance; she contemplated
the form of Visnu in detail as advised by her smiling son, Kapiladeva. At
the same time, she was thinking of Kapiladeva, who is the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, and therefore she completely perfected her
austerities, penances and transcendental realization.

TRANSLATION

Situated in eternal trance and freed from illusion impelled by the modes
of material nature, she forgot her material body, just as one forgets his
different bodies in a dream.

PURPORT

A great Vaigpava said that he who has no remembrance of his body is
not bound to material existence. As long as we are conscious of our bodily
existence, it is to be understood that we are living conditionally, under the
three modes of material nature. When one forgets his bodily existence, his
conditional material life is over. This forgetfulness is actually possible
when we engage our senses in the transcendental loving service of the


--- Page 445 ---
Text 28] Activities of Kapila 1447
Lord. In the conditional state one engages his senses as a member of a
family, or as a member of a society or country, etc. But when one
forgets all such membership in material circumstances and realizes that he
is an eternal servant of the Supreme Lord, that is actual forgetfulness of
material existence.

This forgetfulness actually occurs when one renders service unto the
Lord. A devotee no longer works with the body for sense gratification
with family, society, country, humanity and so on. He simply works
for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna. That is perfect Krsna
consciousness.

A devotee always merges in transcendental happiness, and therefore he
has no experience of material distresses. This transcendental happiness is
called eternal bliss. According to the opinion of devotees, constant remem-
brance of the Supreme Lord is called samadhi, or trance. If one is
constantly in trance, there is no possibility of his being attacked or even
touched by the modes of material nature. As soon as one is freed from the
contamination of the three material modes, he no longer has to take birth
to transmigrate from one form to another in this material world.

TRANSLATION

Her body was being taken care of by the spiritual damsels created by
her husband Kardama, and since she had no mental anxiety at that time,
her body did not become thin. She appeared just like a fire surrounded by
smoke.


--- Page 446 ---
1448 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 33
PURPORT
Because she was always in trance in transcendental bliss, the thought of
the Personality of Godhead was always carefully fixed in her mind. She
did not become thin, for she was taken care of by the celestial maid-
servants created by her husband. It is said, according to the A yur-vedic
medical science, that if one is free from anxieties he generally becomes
fat. Devahuti, being situated in Krspa consciousness, had no mental
anxieties, and therefore her body did not become thin. It is customary in
the renounced order of life that one should not take any service from a
servant or maid, but Devahiiti was being served by the celestial maid-
servants. This may appear to be against the spiritual concept of life, but
just as fire is still beautiful even when surrounded by smoke, she looked
completely pure although it seemed that she was living in a luxurious way.

loosened or her garments were disarrayed.
PURPORT
In this verse the word daiva-guptam, “protected by the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead,” is very significant. Once one surrenders unto the


--- Page 447 ---
Text 30] Activities of Kapila 1449
service of the Supreme Lord, the Lord takes charge of the maintenance of
the devotee’s body, and there is no need of anxiety for its protection. It is
said in the Second Chapter, Second Canto, of Srimad-Bhagavatam that a
fully surrendered soul has no anxiety about the maintenance of his body.
The Supreme Lord takes care of the maintenance of innumerable species
of bodies; therefore, one who fully engages in His service will not go
unprotected by the Supreme Lord. Devahuti was naturally unmindful for
the protection of her body, which was being taken care of by the Supreme
Person.

TRANSLATION
My dear Vidura, by following the principles instructed by Kapila,
Devahiiti soon became liberated from material bondage, and she achieved
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as Supersoul, without difficulty.
PURPORT
Three words have been used in this connection to describe the achieve-
ment of Devahuti: atmanam, brahma-nirvanam and bhagavantam. These
refer to the gradual process of discovery of the Absolute Truth, mentioned
herein as the bhagavantam. The Supreme Personality of Godhead resides
in various Vaikuptha planets. Nirvana means to extinguish the pangs of
material existence. When one is able to enter into the spiritual kingdom or
into spiritual realization, one is automatically freed from material pangs.
That is called brahma-nirvana. According to Vedic scripture, nirvana


--- Page 448 ---
1450 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 3, Ch. 33
means cessation of the materialistic way of life. Atmdnam means realiza-
tion of the Supersoul within the heart. Ultimately, the highest perfection
is realization of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is to be under-
stood that Devahuti entered the planet which is called Kapila Vaikuntha.
There are innumerable Vaikuntha planets predominated by the expansions
of छप. All the Vaikugtha planets are known by a particular name of
Visnu. As we understand from Brahma-sambhita, advaitam acyutam anadim
ananta-ripam. Ananta means innumerable. The Lord has innumerable
expansions of His transcendental form, and according to the different
positions of the symbolical representations in His four hands, He is known
as Narayapa, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, Vasudeva, etc. There is also a
Vaikuntha planet known as Kapila Vaikunptha, to which Devahuti was
promoted to meet Kapila and reside there eternally, enjoying the company
of her transcendental son.

While He was passing in the northern direction, all the celestial denizens
known as Caranas and Gandharvas, as well as the munis and the damsels of

offered Him oblations and a place of residence.
PURPORT
It is understood that Kapila Muni first went towards the Himalayas and
traced the course of the River Ganges, and He again came to the delta of
the Ganges at the sea now known as the Bay of Bengal. The ocean gave
Him residence at a place still known as Garfiga-sagara, where the River
Ganges meets the sea. That place is called Ganga-sagara Tirtha, and even
today people gather there to offer respects to Kapiladeva, the original
author of the sankhya system of philosophy. Unfortunately, this sankhya
system has been misrepresented by an imposter who is also named Kapila,
but that other system of i does not tally with anything described
in the sankhya of Kapila in the Srimad-Bhagavatam.

The description of the dealings of Kapiladeva and His mother is very
confidential, and anyone who hears or reads this narration becomes a

Garuda, and he thereafter enters into the abode of the Supreme Lord to
engage in the transcendental loving service of the Lord.
PURPORT
The narration of Kapiladeva and His mother Devahiiti is so perfect and
transcendental that even if one only hears or reads this description, he
achieves the highest perfectional goal of life, for he engages in the loving
service of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There is
no doubt that Devahiiti, who had the Supreme Lord as her son and who
followed the instructions of Kapiladeva so nicely, attained the highest
perfection of human life.
