TRANSLATION
Suita Gosvami said: Thereafter the Pandavas, desiring to deliver water
to the dead relatives who had desired it, went to the Ganges with Lord
Krsna. The ladies walked in front.
PURPORT
To date it is the custom in the Hindu society to go to the Ganges or to
any other sacred river to take bath when death occurs in the family. Each
of the family members pours out a potful of the Ganges water for the
departed soul and walks in a procession, with the ladies in the front. The
375

Pandavas also followed the rules more than five thousand years ago. Lord
Krsna, being a cousin of the Pandavas, is also amongst the family members.

they bathed in the Ganges, whose water is sanctified due to being mixed
with the dust of the lotus feet of the Lord.

TRANSLATION
There the King of the Kurus, Maharija Yudhisthira, along with his
younger brothers, Dhrtai 35013, Gandhari, Kunti, Draupadi and also Lord
Krsna, all sat, overwhelmed with grief.
PURPORT

The Battle of Kuruksetra was fought between family members, and thus
all affected persons were also family members like Maharaja Yudhisthira
and brothers, Kunti, Draupadi, Subhadra, Dhrtarastra, Gandhari and her
daughters-in-law, etc. All the principal dead bodies were in some way or
other related with each other, and therefore the family grief was com-
bined. Lord Krsna was also one of them as a cousin of the Pandavas and
nephew of Kuntl, as well as brother of Subhadra, etc. The Lord was,
therefore, equally sympathetic toward all of them, and therefore He began
to pacify them befittingly.

TRANSLATION
Lord Sri Krsna and the munis began to pacify those who were shocked

and affected, citing the stringent laws of the Almighty and their reactions
upon living beings.


--- Page 4 ---
378 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 8
PURPORT

The stringent laws of nature under the order of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead cannot be altered by any living entity. The living entities are
eternally under the subjugation of the Almighty Lord. The Lord makes all
the laws and orders, and these laws and orders are generally called dharma
or religion. No one can create any religious formula. Bona fide religion is
to abide by the orders of the Lord. The Lord’s orders are clearly declared
in the Bhagavad-gita. Everyone should follow Him only or His orders, and
that will make all happy, both materially and spiritually. As long as we are
in the material world, it is our duty to follow the orders of the Lord, and
if by the grace of the Lord we are liberated from the clutches of the
material world, then in our liberated stage also we can render transcen-
dental loving service unto the Lord. In our material stage we can neither
see ourselves nor the Lord for want of spiritual vision. But when we are
liberated from the material affection and are situated in our original
spiritual form we can see both ourselves as well as the Lord face to face.
Mukti means to be reinstated in one’s original spiritual status after giving
up the material conception of life. Therefore, human life is specifically
meant for qualifying ourselves for this spiritual liberty. Unfortunately,
under the influence of illusory material energy, we accept this spot-life for
a few years only as our permanent existence and thus become illusioned
by possessing so-called country, home, land, children, wife, community,
wealth, etc., which are false representations created by maya (illusion).
And under the dictation of maya, we fight with one another to protect
these false possessions. By cultivating spiritual knowledge, we can realize
that we have nothing to do with all this material paraphernalia. Then at
once we become free from material attachment. And this clearance of the
misgivings of material existence at once takes place by association of the
Lord’s devotees who are able to inject the transcendental sound into the
depth of the bewildered heart and thus make him practically liberated
from all lamentation and illusion. That is a summary of the pacifying
measures for those affected by the reaction of stringent material laws,
exhibited in the forms of birth, death, old age and disease, insoluble
factors of material existence. The victims of war, namely, the family
members of the Kurus, were lamenting the problems of death, and the
Lord pacified them on the basis of knowledge.

svar rajyarn kitavair hrtam
ghatayitvasato rajiiah

sadhayitva—having executed; ajata-satroh—of one who has no enemy;
svam rajyam—own kingdom: kitavaih—by the clever (Duryodhana and
party); hrtam—usurped; ghatayitva—having killed; asatali—the unscrupu-
lous; rajiah—of the queen’s; kaca—bunch of hair: sparsa—roughly
handled: ksata— decreased: ayusah—by the duration of life.

TRANSLATION
The clever Duryodhana and his party cunningly usurped the kingdom
of Yudhisthira, who had no enemy. By the grace of the Lord, the recovery
was executed, and the unscrupulous kings who joined with Duryodhana
were killed by Him. Others also died, their duration of life being decreased
for their having roughly handled the hair of Queen Draupadi.
PURPORT

In the glorious days, or before the advent of the age of Kali, the
brahmanas, the cows, the women, the children and the old men were
properly given protection.

1. The protection of the brahmanas maintains the institution of varna
and &rama, the most scientific culture for attainment of spiritual life.

2. The protection of cows maintains the most miraculous form of food,
i.e., milk for maintaining the finer tissues of the brain for understanding
higher aims of life.

3. The protection of women maintains the chastity of society by which
we can get a good generation for peace, tranquility and progress of life.

4. The protection of children gives the human form of life its best
chance to prepare the way of liberty from material bondage. Such pro-
tection of children begins from the very day of begetting a child by the
purificatory process of Garbhadhana-samskara, the beginning of pure life.

5.. The protection of the old men gives them a chance to prepare them-
selves for better life after death. This complete outlook is based on factors
leading to successful humanity as against the civilization of polished cats
and dogs.

The killing of these innocent creatures is totally forbidden because even
by insulting them one loses one’s duration of life. In the age of Kali they


--- Page 6 ---
380 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 8
are not properly protected, and therefore the duration of life of the
present generation has shortened considerably. In the Bhagavad-gita it is
stated that when the women become unchaste for want of proper pro-
tection, there are unwanted children called varna-sankaras. To insult a
chaste woman means to bring about disaster in the duration of life.
Duhs$asana, a brother of Duryodhana, insulted Draupadi, an ideal chaste
lady, and therefore the miscreants died untimely. These are some of the
stringent laws of the Lord, mentioned above.

TRANSLATION
Lord Sri Krsna caused three well-performed Aévamedha-yajfias [horse
sacrifices] to be conducted by Maharaja Yudhisthira and thus caused his
virtuous fame to be glorified in all directions, like that of Indra, who had
performed one hundred such sacrifices.
PURPORT
This is something like the preface of the performances of A$vamedha-
yajiia by Maharaja Yudhisthira. The comparison of Maharaja Yudhisthira
to the King of heaven is significant. The King of heaven is thousands and
thousands of times greater than Maharaja Yudhisthira in opulence, yet the
fame of Mahardja Yudhisthira was not less. The reason is that Maharaja


--- Page 7 ---
Text 7] Prayers by Queen Kunti 381
Yudhisthira was a pure devotee of the Lord, and by His grace only he was
on the level of the King of heaven, even though King Yudhisthira per-
formed only three yajiias, whereas the King of heaven performed hundreds.
That is the prerogative of the devotee of the Lord. The Lord is equal to
everyone, but a devotee of the Lord is more glorified because he is always
in touch with the all-great. The sun rays are equally distributed, but still
there are some places which are dark always. This is not due to the sun but
to the receptive power. Similarly, those who are cent percent devotees of
the Lord get the full-fledged mercy of the Lord, which is always equally
distributed everywhere.

TRANSLATION
Lord Sri Krsna then prepared for His departure. He invited the sons of
Pandu, after having been worshiped by the brahmanas, headed by Srila
Vyasadeva. The Lord also reciprocated greetings.
PURPORT
Apparently Lord Sri Krsna was a ksatriya and was not worshipable
by the brahmanas. But the brahmanas present there, headed by Srila
Vyasadeva, all knew Him to be the Personality of Godhead, and therefore
they worshiped Him, but the Lord reciprocated the greetings just to honor
the social order that a ksatriya is obedient to the orders of the brahmanas.


--- Page 8 ---
382 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 8
Although Lord Sri Krsna was always offered the respects of the Supreme
Lord from all responsible quarters, the Lord never deviated from the
customary usages between the four orders of society. The Lord purposely
observed all these social customs so that others would follow Him in the
future.

TRANSLATION
As soon as He seated Himself on the chariot to start for Dvaraka, He
saw Uttara hurrying toward Him in fear.
PURPORT
All members of the family of the Pandavas were completely dependent
on the protection of the Lord, and therefore the Lord also protected all
of them in all circumstances. The Lord protects everyone, but one who
depends completely upon Him is especially looked after by the Lord. The
father is more attentive to the little son who is exclusively dependent on
the father.

TRANSLATION
Uttara said: O Lord of lords, Lord of the universe! You are the
greatest of the mystics. Please protect me, for there is no one else who can
save me from the clutches of death in this world of duality.
PURPORT
This material world is the world of duality in contrast with the oneness
of the absolute realm. The world of duality is composed of matter and
spirit, whereas the absolute world is complete spirit without any tinge of
the material qualities. In the dual world everyone is falsely trying to
become the master of the world, whereas in the absolute world the Lord is
the Absolute Lord and all others are [115 absolute servitors. In the world of
duality everyone is envious of all others, and death is inevitable due to the
dual existence of matter and spirit. The Lord is the only shelter of fearless-
ness for the surrendered soul. No one can save himself from the cruel
hands of death in the material world without having surrendered himself
at the iotus feet of the Lord.

O my Lord, You are all-powerful. A fiery iron arrow is coming

but please do not let it burn and abort my embryo. Please do me this favor,
my Lord.
PURPORT
This incidence took place after the death of Abhimanyu, the husband
of Uttara. As the widow of Abhimanyu, she should have followed the
path of her husband, but because she was pregnant and Maharaja Pariksit,
a great devotee of the Lord, was lying in embryo, she was responsible for
his protection. The mother of a child has a great responsibility in giving all
protection to the child, and therefore she was not ashamed to express this
frankly before Lord Krsna. Uttara was the daughter of a great king, the
wife of a great hero and student of a great devotee, and later she was the
mother of a good king also. She was fortunate in every respect.

tionate to His devotees, having patiently heard her words, could at once
understand that Agévatthama, the son of Dronacarya, had thrown the
brahmastra to finish the last life in the Pandava family.
PURPORT
The Lord is impartial in every respect, but still He is inclined towards
His devotees because there is a great necessity of this for everyone’s well-
being. The Pandava family is a family of devotees, and therefore the Lord
wanted them to rule the world. That was the reason that He vanquished
the rule of the company of Duryodhana and established the rule of
Maharaja Yudhisthira. Therefore, He wanted to protect Maharaja Pariksit
also, who was lying in embryo. He did not like the idea that the world
should be without the Pandavas, the ideal family of devotees.

PURPORT
The brahmastras are finer than the nuclear weapons. Aévatthama dis-
charged the brahmastras simply to kill the Pandavas, namely the five
brothers headed by Mahardja Yudhisthira and their only grandson lying
within the womb of Uttara. Therefore the brahmastra, more effective and
finer than the atomic weapons, was not as blind as the atomic bombs.
When the atomic bombs are discharged they do not discriminate between
the target and others. Mainly the atomic bombs do harm to the innocent
because there is no control. The brahmastra is not like that. It marks out
the target and proceeds accordingly without harming the innocent.

TRANSLATION
The Almighty Personality of Godhead Sri Krsna, having observed that
a great danger was befalling His unalloyed devotees who were fully
surrendered souls, at once took up His Sudaréana disc in order to protect
them.
PURPORT
The brahmastra or the supreme weapon released by Asvatthima was
something similar to the nuclear weapon but with more radiation and


--- Page 13 ---
Text 14] Prayers by Queen Kunti 387
heat. This brahmastra is the product of a more subtle science, being the
product of a finer sound or mantra recorded in the Vedas. Another
advantage of this weapon is that it is not blind like the nuclear weapon
because it can be directed only to the target and nothing else. Asvatthama
released the weapon just to finish all the male members of Pandu’s
family; therefore in one sense it was more dangerous than the atomic
bombs because it could penetrate even the most protected place and
would never miss the target. Knowing all this, Lord Sri Krsna took up
at once His personal weapon to protect His devotees, who did not know
anyone other than Krsna. In the Bhagavad-gita the Lord has clearly
promised that His devotees are never to be vanquished. And He behaves
according to the quality or degree of the devotional service by the
devotees. Here the word ananya-visayatmanam is significant. Tlie Pandavas
were cent percent dependent on the protection of the Lord, although
they were all great warriors themselves. But the Lord neglects even the
greatest warrior and also vanquishes them in no time. When the Lord saw
that there was no time for the Pandavas to counteract the brahmastra of
Aévatthama, He took up the weapon even at the risk of breaking His own
vow. Although the Battle of Kuruksetra was almost finished, still, accord-
ing to His vow, He should not have taken up His own weapon. But the
emergency was more important than the vow. He is better known as the
bhakta-vatsala, or the lover of His devotee, and thus He preferred to
continue as bhakta-vatsala than to be a worldly moralist who never breaks
his solemn vow.

TRANSLATION
The Lord of supreme mysticism Sri Krsna resides within everyone's
heart as the Paramatma. As such, just to protect the progeny of the Kuru
dynasty, He covered the embryo of Uttara by His personal energy.
PURPORT
The Lord of supreme mysticism can simultaneously reside within
everyone’s heart, or even within the atoms, by His Paramatma feature,
His plenary portion. Therefore, from within the body of Uttara He
covered the embryo to save Maharaja Pariksit and protect the progeny of
Maharaja Kuru in which King Pandu was also a descendant. Both the sons
of Dhrtarastra and those of Pandu all belonged to the same dynasty of
Maharaja Kuru; therefore both of them were generally known as Kurus.
But particularly, when there were differences between the two brothers’
families, the sons of Dhrtarastra were known as Kurus while the sons of
Pandu were known as Pandavas. Since the sons and grandsons of Dhrtarastra
were all killed in the Battle of Kuruksetra, the last son of the dynasty is
thus designated as the son of the Kurus.

PURPORT

In the Bhagavad-gita it is said that the brahmajyoti or the glowing
effulgence transcendental is resting on Lord Sri Krsna. In other words,
the glowing effulgence kriown as brahmatejas is nothing but the rays of the
Lord, just as the sun rays are rays of the sun disc. So this Brahma
weapon also, although materially irresistible, could not surpass the supreme
strength of the Lord. The weapon called brahmasiras, released by
Aévatthami, was neutralized and foiled by Lord Sri Krspa by His own
energy; that is to say, He did not wait for any other’s help because He is
absolute.

O brahmanas, do not think this to be especially wonderful in the
activities of the mysterious and infallible Personality of Godhead. It is so
because He, by His own transcendental energy, maintains and annihilates
all material things, although He Himseif is unborn.
PURPORT

The activities of the Lord are always inconceivable to the tiny brain of
the living entities. Nothing is impossible for the Supreme Lord, but all His
actions are wonderful for us, and thus He is always beyond the range of
our conceivable limits. The Lord is the all-powerful, all-perfect Personality
of Godhead. The Lord is cent percent perfect, whereas others, namely


--- Page 16 ---
390 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 8
Brahma, Narayana, Siva, the demigods and all other living beings, possess
only different percentages of such perfection. No one is equal to or greater
than Him. He is unrivalled.

TRANSLATION
Thus saved from the radiation of the brahmastra, Kunti, the chaste
devotee of the Lord, and her five sons and Draupadi, addressed Lord Krsna
as He started for home.
PURPORT

Kunti is described herein as sati, or chaste, due to her unalloyed devo-
tion to Lord Sri Krsna. Her mind will just now be expressed in the follow-
ing prayers for Lord Krsna. A chaste devotee of the Lord does not look to
others, namely any other living being or demigod, even for deliverance
from danger. That was all along the characteristic of the whole family of
the Pandavas. They knew nothing except Krsna, and therefore the Lord
was also always ready to help them in all respects and in all circumstances.
That is the transcendental nature of the Lord. He reciprocates the de-
pendence of the devotee. One should not, therefore, look for help from
imperfect living beings or demigods, but one should look for all help from
Lord Krsna, who is competent to save His devotees. Such a chaste devotee
also never asks the Lord for help, but the Lord, out of His own accord, is
always anxious to render it.

Srimati Kunti said: O Krsna, I offer my obeisances unto You because
You are the original personality and are unaffected by the qualities of the
material world. You are existing both within and without everything, yet
You are invisible to all.
PURPORT
Srimati Kuntidevi was quite aware that Krsna was the original Personali-
ty of Godhead, although He was playing the part of her nephew. Such an
enlightened lady could not commit a mistake by offering obeisances unto
her nephew. Therefore, she addressed Him as the original purusa beyond
the material cosmos. Although all living entities are also transcendental,
they are neither original nor infallible. The living entities are apt to fall
down under the clutches of material nature, but the Lord is never like that.
In the Vedas, therefore, He is described as the chief amongst all living en-
tities. Then again He is addressed as isvara, or the controller. The living
entities or the demigods like Indra, Candra, Siirya, etc., are also to some
extent isvara, but none of them is the supreme 4007৫ or the ultimate con-
troller. He is the paramesvara, or the Supersoul. He is both within and with-

out. Although He was present before Srimat Kunti as her nephew, He
was also within her and everyone else. In the Bhagavad-gita the Lord says
(Bg. 15.15), “I am situated in everyone’s heart, and due to Me only one
remembers, forgets and is cognizant, etc. Through all the Vedas I am to
be known because I am the compiler of the Vedas, and I am the teacher of
the Vedanta.” Queen [पात affirms that the Lord, although both within
and without all living beings, is still invisible. The Lord is, so to speak, a
puzzle for the common man. Queen Kunti experienced personally that
Lord Krsna was present before her, yet He entered within the womb of
Uttara to save her embryo from the attack of Aévatthama’s brahmastra.
Kunti herself was puzzled whether Sri Krsna is all-pervasive or localized.
In fact, He is both. but He reserves the right of not being exposed to per-
sons who are not surrendered souls. This checking curtain is called the
maya energy of the Supreme Lord, and it controls the limited vision of the
rebelled soul. It is explained as follows.

Text 19] Prayers by Queen Kunti 393
PURPORT

In the Bhagavad-gita the Lord affirms that less intelligent persons mis-
take Lord Sri Krsna to be an ordinary man like us, and thus they deride
Him. The same is confirmed herein by Queen Kunti. The less intelligent
persons are those who rebel against the authority of the Lord. Such per-
sons are known 88 asuras. The asuras cannot recognize the Lord’s authority.
When the Lord appears Himself amongst us, as Rama, Nrsimhha, Varaha or
in His original form as Krsna, He performs many wonderful acts which
are humanly impossible. As we shall find in the Tenth Canto of this great
literature, Lord Sri Krsna exhibited His humanly impossible activities even
from the days of 1115 lying in the lap of His mother. He killed the Piitana
witch, although she smeared her breast with poison just to kill the Lord.
The Lord sucked her breast like a natural baby, and He sucked out her
very life also. Similarly, He lifted the Govardhana Hill, just as a boy
picks up a frog’s umbrella, and stood several days continually just to give
protection to the residents of Vrndavana. These are some of the super-
human activities of the Lord described in the authoritative Vedic literatures
like the Puranas, Itihdsas (histories), Upanisads, etc. He has delivered
wonderful instructions in the shape of the Bhagavad-gita. He has shown
marvelous capacities as a hero, as a householder, as a teacher and as a
renouncer. He is accepted as the Supreme Personality of Godhead by such
authoritative personalities as Vyasa, Devala, Asita, Narada, Madhva,
Sankara, Ramanuja, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, Jiva Gosvami, Visvanatha
Cakravarti, Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati and all other authorities of the line.
116 has Himself declared as much in many places of the authentic litera-
tures. And yet there is a class of men with demoniac mentality who are
always reluctant to accept the Lord as the Supreme Absolute Truth. This
is partially due to their poor fund of knowledge and partially due to their
stubborn obstinacy which results from various misdeeds in the past and
present. Such persons could not recognize Lord খা Krsna even when He
was present before them. Another difficulty is that those who depend
more on their imperfect senses cannot realize lim as the Supreme Lord.
Such persons are like the modern scientist. They want to know everything
by their experimental knowledge. But it is not possible to know the
Supreme Person by imperfect experimental knowledge. He is described
herein as adhoksaja, or beyond the range of experimental knowledge. All
our senses are imperfect. We claim to observe everything and anything, but
we must admit that we can observe things under certain material condi-

tions only, which are also beyond our control. The Lord is beyond the
observation of sense perception. Queen Kuntl accepts this deficiency of
the conditioned soul, especially of the woman class who are less intelligent.
For less intelligent men there must be such things as temples, mosques or
churches co that they may begin to recognize the authority of the Lord
and hear about Him from authorities in such holy places. For less intelli-
gent men, such beginning of spiritual life is essential, and only foolish men
decry the establishment of such places of worship, which are required to
raise the standard of spiritual attributes for the mass of people. For less
intelligent persons, bowing down before the authority of the Lord. as is
generally done in the temples, mosques or churches, is as beneficial as it is
for the advanced devotees to meditate upon Him by active service.

Even the greatest philosophical speculators cannot have access to the
region of the Lord. It is said in the Upanisads that the Supreme Truth


--- Page 21 ---
Text 21] Prayers by Queen Kunti 395
Absolute Personality of Godhead is beyond the range of the thinking
power of the greatest philosopher. He is unknowable by great learning or
by the greatest brain. He is only knowable by one who has His mercy.
Others may go on thinking about Him for years together. yet He is un-
knowable. This very fact is corroborated by the Queen, and she is playing
the part of an innocent woman. Women in general are unable to speculate
like philosophers. but they are blessed by the Lord because they believe at

number in any sort of religious function. In every country and in every
sect of religion it appears that the women are more interested than the
men. This simplicity of acceptance of the authority of the Lord is more
effective than showy insincere religious fervor.

to show His special mercy upon His unalloyed devotees and to diminish
the upsurges of the demoniac persons. Queen Kunti specifically adores the
incarnation or descent of Lord Krsna above all other incarnations because
in this particular incarnation He is more approachable. In the Rama
incarnation He remained a king’s son from His very childhood, but in the
incarnation of Krsna, although He was son of a king, He at once left the
shelter of His real father and mother (King Vasudeva and Queen Devakr)
just after His appearance and went to the lap of Yadodamayl to play the
part of an ordinary cowherd boy in the blessed Vrajabhiimi, which is very
sanctified because of His childhood pastimes. Therefore Lord Krsna is
more merciful than Lord Rama. He was undoubtedly very kind to Kunt?’s
brother Vasudeva and the family. Had He not become the son of
Vasudeva and Devaki, Queen Kunti could not claim Him to be her nephew
and thus address Krsna in parental affection. But Nanda and Yasoda are
more fortunate because they could relish the Lord’s childhood pastimes,
which are niore attractive than all other pastimes. There is no parallel to
His childhood pastimes as exhibited at Vrajabhiimi, which are the proto-
types of His eternal affairs in the original Krsnaloka described as the
cintamani-dhama in the Brahma-sanhita. Lord Sri Krsna descended Him-
self at Vrajabhiimi with all His transcendental entourage and paraphernalia.
Sif Caitanya Mahaprabhu therefore confirmed that no one is as fortunate
as the residents of Vrajabhiimi, and specifically the cowherd girls who
dedicated their everything for the satisfaction of the Lord. His pastimes
with Nanda and Yadoda and His pastimes with the cowherd men and
especially with the cowherd boys and the cows have caused Him to be
known as Govinda. Lord Krsna as Govinda is more inclined to the
brahmanas and the cows, indicating thereby that human prosperity de-
pends more on these two items, namely brahminical culture and cow
protection. Lord Krsna is never satisfied where these are lacking.

TRANSLATION
My respectful obeisances are unto You, O Lord, whose abdomen is

garlands of lotus flowers, whose glance is as cool as the lotus and whose
feet are engraved with lotuses.
PURPORT
Here are some of the specific symbolical marks on the spiritual body of
the Personality of Godhead which distinguish His body from the bodies of all
others. They are all special features of the body of the Lord. The Lord
may appear as one of us, but He is always distinct by His specific bodily
features. Srimati Kunti claims herself as unfit to see the Lord because of
her being a woman. This is claimed because women, sidras (the laborer
class) and the dvija-bandhus, or the wretched descendants of the higher
three classes, are unfit by intelligence to understand transcendental subject
matter concerning the spiritual name, fame, attributes, forms, etc., of the
Supreme Absolute Truth. Such persons, although they are unfit to enter
into the spiritual affairs of the Lord, can see Him as the arca-vigraha who
descends on the material world just to distribute favors to the fallen souls,
including the above-mentioned women, sidras and dvija-bandhus. Because
such fallen souls cannot see anythingbeyond matter, the Lord condescends
to enter into each and every one of the innumerable universes as the
Garbhodakasay1 Visnu, who grows a lotus stem from the lotus-like depres-
sion in the center of His transcendental abdomen, and thus Brahma, the
first living being in the universe, is born. Therefore, the Lord is known as
the Pankajanabhi. The Pankajanabha Lord accepts the arca-vigraha (His
transcendental form) in different elements, namely a form within the
mind, a form made of wood, a form made of earth, a form made of metal,
a form made of jewel, a form made of painting, a form drawn on sand, etc.
All such forms of the Lord are always decorated with garlands of lotus


--- Page 24 ---
398 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 8
flower. and there should be a soothing atmosphere in the temple of wor-
ship to attract the burning attention of the nondevotees always engaged
in material wranglings. The meditators worship a form within the mind.
Therefore, the Lord is merciful even to the women, sadras and dvije-
bandhus, provided they agree to visit the temple of worship in different
forms made for them. Such temple visitors are not idolators, as alleged by
some men with a poor fund of knowledge. All the great dcaryas established
such temples of worship in all places just to favor the less intelligent, and
one should not pose himself as transcending the stage of temple worship
while one is actually in the category of the sidrus and the women or less.
One should begin to see the Lord from His lotus feet, gradually rising to
the thighs, waist, chest and face. One should not try to look at the face of
the Lord without being accustomed to seeing the lotus feet of the Lord.
Srimati Kunti, because of her being the aunt of the Lord, did not begin to
see the Lord from the lotus feet because the Lord might feel ashamed, and
thus Kuntidevi, just to save a painful situation for the Lord, began to see
the Lord just above His lotus feet, i.e., from the waist of the Lord, gradu-
ally rising to the face, and then down to the lotus feet. In the round,
evervthing there is in order.

0 Hrsikesa, master of the senses and Lord of lords, You have released
Your mother Devaki. who was long imprisoned and distressed by the
envious King Karisa, and myself and my children from a series of constant
dangers.
PURPORT
Devaki., the mother of Krsna and sister of King Kamsa, was put into
prison along with her husband Vasudeva because the envious King was
afraid of being Killed by the eighth son (Krsna) of Devaki. He therefore
Killed all the sons of Devaki who were horn before Krsna, but Krsna
escaped the danger of child-slaughter because He was transferred to the
house of Nanda Maharaja, Lord 1 13035 foster father. Kuntidevi was also
saved from a series of dangers along with her children. But Kuntidevi was
shown more favor because Lord Krsna did not save the other children of
Devaki, whereas He saved the children of Kuntidevi. This was done because
Devak?’s husband, Vasudeva, was living, but Kuntidevi was a widow, and
there was none to help her except Krsna. The conclusion is that Krsna
endows more favor to a devotee who is in greater dangers. Sometimes He
puts His pure devotees in such dangers because in that condition of
helplessness the devotee becomes more attached to the Lord. The more the
attachment is there for the Lord, the more success is there for the devotee.

My dear Krsna, Your Lordship has protected us from a poisoned cake,
from a great fire, from cannibals, from the vicious assembly, from suf-
ferings during our exile in the forest and from the battle where great
generzls fought. And now You have saved us from the weapon of
Asvatthama.

PURPORT

The list of dangerous encounters is submitted herein. Devaki was once
put into difficulty by her envious brother, otherwise she was well. But
Kuntidevi and her sons were put into one difficulty after another for
years and years together. They were put into trouble by Duryodhana and
party due to the kingdom, and each and every time the sons of Kunti were
saved by the Lord. Once Bhima was administered poison in a cake form,
once they were put into the house made of shellac and set afire, and once
Draupadi was dragged out, and attempts were made to insult her by
stripping her naked in the vicious assembly of the Kurus. The Lord saved
Draupadi by supplying an immeasurable length of cloth, and Duryodhana’s
party failed to see her naked. Similarly, when they were exiled in the
forest, Bhima had to fight with the man-eater demon Hidimba raksasa, but
the Lord saved him. So it was not finished there. After all these tribula-
tions, there was the great Battle of Kuruksetra, and Arjuna had to meet
such great generals as Drona, Bhisma, Karna, etc., all powerful fighters.
And at last, even when everything was done away with, there was the
brahmastra released by the son of Dronacarya within the womb of Uttara,
and so the Lord saved the only surviving descendant of the Kurus,
Maharaja Pariksit.

TRANSLATION
1 wish that all those calamities would happen again and again so that
we can see You again and again, for seeing You means that we will no
longer see repeated births and deaths.
PURPORT

Generally the distressed, the needy, the intelligent and the inquisitive,
who have performed some pious activities, worship or begin to worship the
Lord. Others, who are thriving on misdeeds only, regardless of status,
cannot approach the Supreme due to being misled by the illusory energy.
Therefore, for a pious person if there is some calamity there is no other
alternative than to take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord. Constantly
remembering the lotus feet of the Lord means preparing for liberation
from birth and death. Therefore, even though there are so-called calamities,
they are welcome because they give us opportunity to remember the Lord,
which means liberation.

One who has taken shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord, which are
accepted as the most suitable boat for crossing the ocean of nescience, can
be liberated as easily as one leaps over the holes made by the hoofs of a
calf. Such persons are meant to reside in the abode of the Lord, and they
have nothing to do with a place where there is danger in every step.

This material world is certified by the Lord in the Bhagavad-gita as a
dangerous place full of calamities. Less intelligent persons prepare plans to
adjust to those calamities without knowing that the nature of this place is
itself full of calamities. They have no information of the abode of the
Lord, which is full of bliss and without trace of calamity. The duty of the
sane person is, therefore, not to be disturbed by the worldly calamities,
which are sure to happen in all circumstances, but suffering all sorts of


--- Page 28 ---
402 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 8
unavoidable misfortunes, one should make progress in spiritual realization,
because that is the mission of human life. The spirit soul is transcendental
to all material calamities: therefore, the so-called calamities are called false.
५ man may see a tiger swallowing him in a dream, and he may cry for this
calamity. Actually there is no tiger and there is no suffering, but it is
simply a case of dreams. In the same way, all calamities of life are said to
be dreams. If someone is lucky enough to getin contact with the Lord by
devotional service. it is all gain. Contact with the Lord by any one of the
nine devotional services is always a forward step on the path of going back
to Godhead.

My Lord, Your Lordship can easily be approached, but only by
those who are materially exhausted. One who is on the path of [material |
progress, trying to improve himself with respectable parentage, great
opulence, high education and bodily beauty, cannot approach You with
sincere feeling.
PURPORT

Being materially advanced means taking birth in an aristocratic family,
possessing great wealth, an education and attractive personal beauty. All
materialistic men are mad after possessing all these material opulences, and
this is known as advancement of material civilization. But the result is that
by possessing all these material assets one becomes artificially puffed up,


--- Page 29 ---
Text 27] Prayers by Queen Kunti 403
intoxicated by such temporary possessions. Consequently, such materially
puffed up persons are incapable of uttering the holy name of the Lord by
addressing Him feelingly as “0 Govinda, O Krsna.” It is said in the
565८705 that by once uttering the holy name of the Lord, the sinner gets rid
of a quantity of sins that he is unable to commit. Such is the power of
uttering the holy name of the Lord. There isnot the least exaggeration in
this statement. Actually the Lord's holy name has such powerful potency.
But there is a quality to such utterances also. It depends on the quality of
feeling. A helpless man can feelingly utter the holy name of the Lord,
whereas aman who utters the same holy name in great material satisfaction
cannot be so sincere. Therefore, a materially puffed up person may utter
the holy name of the Lord occasionally, but he is incapable of uttering
the name in quality. Therefore, the four principles of material advancement.
namely 1) high parentage, 2) good wealth. 3) high education, and 4) at-
tractive beauly, etc., are, so to speak, disqualifications for progress on the
path of spiritual advancement. Material covering of the pure spirit soul is
an external feature, as much as fever is an external feature of the unhealthy
body. The general process is to decrease the degree of the fever and not to
aggravate it by maltreatment. Sometimes it is seen that spiritually advanced
persons become materially impoverished. This is no discouragement. On
the other hand, such impoverishment is a good sign as much as the
falling of temperature is a good sign. The principle of life should be to
decrease the degree of material intoxication which leads one to he more
and more illusioned about the aim of life. Grossly illusioned persons are

quite unfit for entrance into the Kingdom of God.

My obeisances are unto You, who are the property of the materially

the material modes of nature. You are self-satisfied, and therefore You are
the most gentle and are master of the monists.
PURPORT
A living being is finished assoon as there is nothing to possess. Therefore
a living being cannot be, in the real sense of the term, a renouncer. A
living being renounces something for gaining something more valuable.
A student sacrifices his childish proclivities to gain better education. A
servant gives up his job for a better job. Similarly, a devotee renounces
the material world not for nothing but for something tangible in spiritual
value. Srila Ripa Gosvami and Sanatana Gosvami and Srila Raghunitha
Gosvami and others gave up their worldly pomp and prosperity for the
sake of the service of the Lord. They were big men in theworldlysense. The
Gosvamis were ministers in the government service of Bengal, and Srila
Dasa Gosvami was the son of a big zamindar of his time. But they left
everything to gain something superior to what they previously possessed.
The devotees are generally without material prosperity, but they have a
very secret treasure house in the lotus feet of the Lord. There is a nice
story about Srila Sanitana Gosvami. He had a touchstone with him, and this
stone was left in a pile of refuse. A needy man took it, but later on won-
dered why the valuable stone was kept in such a neglected place. He there-
fore asked for the most valuable thing from him, and then he was given the
holy name of the Lord. Akificana means one who has nothing to give
materially. A factual devotee or the mahatma does not give anything
material to anyone because he has already left all material assets. He
can, however, deliver the supreme asset, namely the Personality of God-
head, because He is the only property of a factual devotee. The touchstone
of Sanatana Gosvami which was thrown in the rubbish was
not the property of the Gosvami, otherwise it would not have been kept in
such a place. This specific example is given for the neophyte devotees
just to convince them that material hankerings and spiritual advancement
go ill together. Unless one is able to see everything as spiritual in relation
with the Supreme Lord, one must always distinguish between spirit and
matter. A spiritual master like Srila Sanatana Gosvami, although personally
able to see everything as spiritual, set this example for us only because we
have no such spiritual vision.

Text 27] Prayers by Queen Kunti 405

Advancement of material vision or material civilization is a great stum-
bling block for spiritual advancement. Such material advancement entan-
gles the living being in the bondage of a material body followed by all
sorts of material miseries. Such material advancement is called anartha or
things not wanted. Actually this is so. In the present context of material
advancement one uses lipstick at a cost of fifty cents and there are so many
unwanted things which are all products of the material conception of life.
By diverting attention to so many unwanted things, human energy is
spoiled without achievement of spiritual realization, the prime necessity
of human life. The attempt to reach the moon is another example of
spoiling energy because even if the moon is reached, the problems of life
will not be solved. The devotees of the Lord are called akiiicanas be-
cause they have practically no material assets. Such material assets are all
products of the three modes of material nature. They foil spiritual energy.
and thus the less we possess such products of material nature, the more we
have a good chance for spiritual progress.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead has no direct connection with
material activities. All His acts and deeds, which are exhibited even in
this material world, are spiritual and without affection of the modes of
material nature. In the Bhagavad-gita the Lord says that all His acts, even
His appearence and disappearence in and out of the material world, are all
transcendental, and one who knows this perfectly shall not take his birth
again in this material world, but he will go back to Godhead.

The material disease is due to hankering after lording it over material
nature. This hankering is due to an interaction of the three modes of
nature, and both the Lord and the devotees have no attachment for such
false enjoyment. Therefore, the Lord as well as the devotees are called
nivrtta-guna-vrtti. The perfect nivrtta-guna-vrtti is the Supreme Lord be-
cause He never becomes attracted by the modes of material nature, whereas
the living beings have such a tendency. Some of them are entrapped by the
illusory attraction of material nature.

Because the Lord is the property of the devotees and the devotees are
the property of the Lord, reciprocally the devotees are certainly tran-
scendental to the modes of material nature. That is a natural conclusion.
Such unalloyed devotees are distinct from the mixed devotees who ap-
proach the Lord for mitigation of miseries and poverty, inquisitiveness
and speculation. The unalloyed devotees and the Lord are transcendentally
attached to one another. For others, the Lord has nothing to reciprocate,
and therefore He is called atmarama, self-satisfied. Self-satisfied as He is,
He is the master of all monists who seek to merge into the existence of the


--- Page 32 ---
406 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 8
Lord. Such monists merge within the personal effulgence of the Lord
called the brahmajyoti, but the devotees enter into the transcendental
pastimes of the Lord. which are never to be misunderstood as material.

Kuntidevi knew that Krsna was neither her nephew nor an ordinary
family member of her paternal house. She knew perfectly well that Krsna
is the primeval Lord who lives in everyones heart as the Supersoul
Paramatma. Another name of the Paramatma feature of the Lord is kala,
or eternal time. Eternal time is the witness of all our actions good and
bad, and thus resultant reactions are destined by Him. It is no use saying
that we do not know why and for what we are suffering. We may forget
the misdeed for which we may suffer at this present moment, but we must
remember that Paramatma is our constant companion, and therefore He
knows everything, past, present, and future. And because the Paramatma
feature of Lord Krsna destines all actions and reactions, He is the supreme

controller also. Without His sanction not a blade of grass can move. The
living beings are given as much freedom as they deserve, and misuse of that
freedom is the cause of suffering. The devotees of the Lord do not misuse
their freedom, and therefore they are the good sons of the Lord. Others,
who misuse freedom, are put into miseries destined by the eternal kala.
The kala offers the conditioned souls both happiness and miseries. It is
all predestined by eternal time. As we have miseries uncalled-for, so we
may have happiness also without being asked, for they are all predestined
by kala. No one 15 therefore either an enemy or friend of the Lord. Every-
one is suffering and enjoying the result of his own destiny. This destiny
is made by the living beings in course of social intercourse. Everyone wants
here to lord it over the material nature, and thus everyone creales his own
destiny under the supervision of the Supreme Lord. He is all-pervading,
and therefore He can see everyone's activities. And because the Lord has
no beginning or end, He is known also as the eternal time, kala.

408 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1,Ch. 8
PURPORT

The Lord’s mercy upon the fallen souls is equally distributed. He has
no one as the specific object of hostility. The very conception of the
Personality of Godhead as a human being is misleading. His pastimes
appear to be exactly like a human being’s, but actually they are tran-
scendental and without any tinge of material contamination. He is un-
doubtedly known as partial to His pure devotees, but in fact He is never
partial, as much as the sun is never partial to anyone. By utilizing the sun
rays, sometimes even the stones become valuable, whereas a blind man
cannot see the sun, although there are enough sun rays before him. Dark-
ness and light are two opposite conceptions, but this does not mean that
the sun is partial in distributing its rays. The sun rays are open to everyone,
but the capacities of the receptacles differ. Foolish people think that
devotional service is flattering the Lord to get special mercy. Factually
the pure devotees who are engaged in the transcendental loving service of
the Lord are not a mercantile community. A mercantile house renders
service to someone in exchange of values. The pure devotee does not
render service unto the Lord for such exchange, and therefore the full
mercy of the Lord is open for him. Suffering and needy men, inquisitive
persons or the philosophers make temporary connections with the Lord to
serve a particular purpose. When the purpose is served, there is no more
relation with the Lord. A suffering man, if he is pious at all, prays to the
Lord for his recovery. But as soon as the recovery is over, in most cases
the suffering man no longer cares to keep any connection with the Lord.
The mercy of the Lord is open for him, but he is reluctant to receive it.
That is the difference between a pure devotee and a mixed devotee. Those
who are completely against the service of the Lord are considered to be in
abject darkness, those who ask for the Lord’s favor only at the time of
necessity are partial recipients of the mercy of the Lord, and those who
are cent percent engaged in the service of the Lord are full recipients of
the mercy of the Lord. Such partiality of receiving the Lord’s mercy is
relative to the recipient, and it is not due to the partiality of the all-
merciful Lord.

When the Lord descends on this material world by His all-merciful
energy, 116 plays like a human being, and therefore it appears that the
Lord is partial to His devotees only, but that is not a fact. Despite such
apparent manifestation of partiality, His mercy is equally distributed. In
the Battlefield of Kuruksetra all persons who died in the fight before the
presence of the Lord got salvation without the necessary qualifications


--- Page 35 ---
Text 30] Prayers by Queen Kunti 409
because death before the presence of the Lord purifies the passing soul
from the effects of all sins, and therefore the dying man gets a place
somewhere in the transcendental abode. Somehow or other if someone
puts himself open in the sun rays, he is sure to get the requisite benefit
both by heat and ultraviolet rays. Therefore, the conclusion is that the
Lord is never partial. It is wrong for the people in general to think of Him
as partial.

Of course it is bewildering, O soul of the universe, that You work,

PURPORT
The transcendental pastimes of the Lord are not only bewildering but
also apparently contradictory. In other words, they are all inconceivable
to the limited thinking power of the human being. The Lord is the all-
prevailing Supersoul of all existence, and yet He appears in the form of
boar amongst the animals, in the form of a human being as Rama, Krsna,
etc.,in the form of a rsi like Narayana, and in the form of an aquatic like a
fish. Yet it is said that He is unborn, and He has nothing to do. In the Sruti
mantra it is said that the Supreme Brahman has nothing to do. No one is
equal to or greater than Him. He has manifold energies, and everything is


--- Page 36 ---
410 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 8
performed by Him perfectly by automatic knowledge, strength and ac-
tivity. All these prove without any gquestion that the Lord’s activities,
forms and deeds are all inconceivable to our limited thinking power, but
because 116 is inconceivably powerful, everything is possible in Him.
Therefore no one can calculate Him exactly; every action of the Lord is
bewildering to the common man. He cannot be understood by the Vedic
knowledge, but He can be easily understood by the pure devotees because
they are intimately related with Him. The devotees therefore know that
although He appears amongst the animals, He is not an animal, nor a man,
nor a 780, nor a fish. He is eternally the Supreme Lord in all circumstances.

Text 31] Prayers by Queen Kunti 411
PURPORT

Here is another explanation of the bewilderment created by the pastimes
of the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord is the Supreme in all circum-
stances, as already explained. Here is a specific example of the Lord’s being
the Supreme and at the same time a plaything in the presence of His pure
devotee. The Lord’s pure devotee renders service unto the Lord out of
unalloyed love only, and while discharging such devotional service the
pure devotee forgets the position of the Supreme Lord. The Supreme
Lord also accepts the loving service of His devotees more relishably when
the service is rendered spontaneously out of pure affection without any-
thing of reverential admiration. Generally the Lord is worshiped by the
devotees in reverential attitude, but the Lord is meticulously pleased when
the devotee, out of pure affection and love, considers the Lord to be less
important than himself. The Lord's pastimes in the original abode of
Goloka Vrndavana are exchanged in that spirit. The friends of Krsna
consider Him one of them. They do not consider Him to be of reverential
importance. The parents of the Lord (who are all pure devotees) consider
Him a child only. The Lord accepts chastisements of the parents more
cheerfully than the prayers of the Vedic hymns. Similarly, He accepts the
reproaches of His fiancees more palatably than the Vedic hymns. Lord
Krsna, when He was present in this material world to manifest His eternal
pastimes in the transcendental realm of Goloka Vrndavana for an attrac-
tion of the people in general, displayed a unique picture of subordination
before His foster mother Yasoda. The Lord, in His natural childish playful
activities, used to spoil the stocked butter of mother Yasoda by breaking
the pots and distributing the contents to His friends and playmates,
including the celebrated monkeys of Vrndavana who took advantage of
the Lord’s munificence. Mother Yasoda saw this, and out of her pure love
she wanted to make a show of punishment for her transcendental child.
She took a rope and threatened the Lord that she would tie Him up, as is
generally done in the ordinary household. Seeing the rope in the hands of
mother Yasoda, the Lord bowed down 1115 head and began to weep just
like a child, and tears rolled down His cheeks, washing off the black
ointment smeared about His beautiful eyes. This picture of the Lord is
adored by Kuntidevi because she is conscious of the Lord’s supreme
position. He is feared often by fear personified, yet He is afraid of His
mother, who wanted to punish Him just in an ordinary manner. Kunti
was conscious of the exalted position of Krsna, whereas Yasoda was not.


--- Page 38 ---
412 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 8
Therefore Ya$oda’s position was more exalted than Kunti’s. Mother
Yasoda got the Lord as her child, and the Lord made her forget altogether
that her child was the Lord Himself. If mother Ya$oda would have been
conscious of the exalted position of the Lord, she would certainly have
hesitated to punish the Lord. But she was made to forget this situation
because the Lord wanted to make a complete gesture of childishness before
the affectionate Yasoda. This exchange of love between the mother and
the son was performed in a natural way, and Kunti, remembering the
scene, was bewildered, and she could do nothing but praise the transcen-
dental filial love. Indirectly Mother Ya$oda is praised for her unique
position of love, for she could control even the all-powerful Lord as her
beloved child.

Because the Lord’s appearance in this material world is bewildering,
there are different opinions about the birth of the Unborn. In the
Bhagavad-gita the Lord says that He takes His birth in the material world,


--- Page 39 ---
Text 33] Prayers by Queen Kunti 413
although He is the Lord of all creations and He is unborn. So there cannot
be any denial of the birth of the Unborn because He Himself establishes
the truth. But still there are different opinions as to why He takes His
birth. That is also declared in the Bhagavad-gita. He appears by His own
internal potency to reestablish the principles of religion and to protect the
pious and to annihilate the impious. That is the mission of the appearance
of the Unborn. Still, it is said that the Lord is there to glorify the pious
King Yudhisthira. Lord Sri Krsna certainly wanted to establish the kingdom
of the Pandavas for the good of all in the world. When there is a pious
king ruling over the world, the people are happy. When the ruler is
impious, the people are unhappy. In the age of Kali in most cases the rulers
are impious, and therefore the citizens are also continuously unhappy. But
in the case of democracy, the impious citizens themselves send their
representative to rule over them, and therefore they cannot blame anyone
for their unhappiness. Maharaja Nala was also celebrated as a great pious
king, but he had no connection with Lord Krsna. Therefore Maharaja
Yudhisthira is meant here to be glorified by Lord Krsna. He had also
glorified King Yadu, having taken His birth in the family. He is known as
Yadava, Yaduvira, Yadunandana, etc., although the Lord is always inde-
pendent of such obligation. It is just like the sandalwood that grows in the
Malaya hills. Trees can grow anywhere and everywhere, yet because the
sandalwood trees grow mostly in the area of the Malaya hills, the name
sandalwood and the Malaya hills are interrelated. Therefore, the conclusion
is that the Lord is ever unborn like the sun, and yet He appears as the sun
rises on the eastern horizon. As the sun is never the sun of the eastern
horizon, so the Lord is no one’s son, but He is the father of everything
that be.

It is also said that Vasudeva and Devaki, in their previousbirth as Sutapa
and Préni, underwent a severe type of penance to get the Lord as their son,
and as a result of such austerities the 1,010 appeared as their son. It is
already declared in the Bhagavad-gita that the Lord appears for the welfare
of all people of the world and to vanquish the asuras or the materialistic
atheists.

PURPORT

Brahma, or the first living being born just after the creation, is the direct
son of Narayana. Narayana, as Garbhodakasayl Visnu, first of all entered
the material universe. Without spiritual contact, matter cannot create. This
principle was followed from the very beginning of the creation. The
Supreme Spirit entered the universe, and the first living being, Brahma,
was born on a lotus flower grown out of the transcendental abdomen of
Visnu. Visnu is therefore known as Padmanabha. Brahma is known as
atma-bhu because he was begotten directly from the father without any
contact of mother Laksmiji. Laksmiji was present just before Narayana,
engaged in the service of the Lord, and still, without contact with Laksmiji,
Nariyana begot Brahma. That is the omnipotency of the Lord. One who
foolishiy considers Narayana like other living beings should take a lesson
from this. Narayana is not an ordinary living being. He is the Personality
of Godhead Himself, and He has all the potencies of all the senses in all
parts of His transcendental body. An ordinary living being begets a child
by the intercourse of sex, and he has no other means to beget a child other
than the one designed for him. But Narayana, being omnipotent, is not
bound to any condition of energy. He is complete andindependent to do
anything and everything by His various potencies, very easily and perfectly.
Brahma is therefore directly the son of the father and was not put into
the womb of a mother. Therefore he is known as atma-bhu. This Brahma
is in charge of further creations in the universe, secondarily reflected by
the potency of the Omnipotent. Within the halo of the universe there is a
transcendental planet known as Svetadvipa, which is the abode of the
1২910031383 1 Visnu, the Paramatma feature of the Supreme Lord. When-
ever there is trouble in the universe that cannot be solved by the adminis-
trative demigods, they approach Brahmaji for a solution, and if it is not to
be solved even by Brahmaji then Brahmaji consults and prays to the
Ksirodakaday1 Visnu for an incarnation and solution to the problems. Such
a problem arose when Karhsa and others were ruling over the earth and the
earth became too much overburdened by the misdeeds of the asuras.
Brahmaji, along with other demigods, prayed at the shore of the Ksirodaka
Ocean, and they were advised of the descent of Krsna as the son of
Vasudeva and Devaki. So some people say that the Lord appeared because
of the prayers of Brahmaji.

And yet others say that You appeared to rejuvenate the devotional

PURPORT
In the Srimad-Bhagavad-gita the Lord asserts that He appears in every
millennium just to reestablish the way of religion. The way of religion is
made by the Supreme Lord. No one can manufacture a new path of
religion, as is the fashion for certain ambitious persons. The factual way of
religion is to accept the Lord as the supreme authority and thus render
service unto Him in spontaneous love. A living being cannot help but
render service because he is constitutionally made for that purpose. The
only function of the living being is to render service to the Lord. The Lord
is great, and living beings are subordinate to Him. Therefore, the duty of
the living being is just to serve Him only. Unfortunately the illusioned
living beings, out of misunderstanding only, become servants of the senses
by material desire. This desire is called avidyd, or nescience. And out of
such desire the living being makes different plans for material enjoyment
centered about a perverted sex life. He therefore becomes entangled in the
chain of birth and death by transmigrating into different bodies on
different planets under the direction of the Supreme Lord. Unless, there-
fore, one is beyond the boundary of this nescience, one cannot get free
from the threefold miseries of material life. That is the law of nature.
The Lord, however, out of His causeless mercy, because He is more
merciful to the suffering living beings than they can expect, appears before
them and renovates the principles of devotional service comprised of


--- Page 43 ---
Text 36] Prayers by Queen Kunti 417
hearing, chanting, remembering, serving, worshiping, praying, cooperating
and surrendering unto Him. Adoption of all the above-mentioned items,
or any one of them, can help a conditioned soul get out of the tangle of
nescience and thus become liberated from all material sufferings created
by the living being illusioned by the external energy. This particular type
of mercy is bestowed upon the living being by the Lord in the form of
Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.

PURPORT
The Supreme Lord Sif Krsna cannot be seen by our present conditional
vision. In order to see Him, the present vision has to be changed by
developing a different condition of life full of spontaneous love of
Godhead. When इत Krsna was personally present on the face of the globe,
not everyone could see Him as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

418 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 8
Materialists like Ravana, Hiranyaka$ipu, Karsa, Jarasandha, Sisupila, ete!
were highly qualified personalities by acquisition of material assets, but
they were unable to appreciate the presence of the Lord. Therefore, even
though the Lord may be present before our eyes, it is not possible to see
Him unless we have the necessary vision. This necessary qualification is
developed by the process of devotional service only, beginning with hearing
about the Lord from the right sources. The Bhagavad-gita is one of the
popular literatures which is generally heard, chanted, repeated, etc., by
the people in general, but in spite of such hearing, etc., sometimes it is
experienced that the performer of such devotional service does not see
the Lord eye to eye. The reason is that the first item, $ravana, is very
important. If hearing is from the right sources, it acts very quickly.
Generally people hear from unauthorized persons. Such unauthorized
persons may be very learned by academic qualifications, but because they
do not follow the principles of devotional service, hearing from them
becomes a sheer waste of time. Sometimes the texts are interpreted
fashionably to suit their own purposes. Therefore, first one should select
a competent and bona fide speaker and then hear from him. When the
hearing process is perfect and complete, the other processes become
automatically perfect in their own way.

There are different transcendental activities of the Lord, and each and
every one of them is competent to bestow the desired result, provided
the hearing process is perfect. In the Bhagavatam the activities of the Lord
begin from His dealings with the Pandavas. There are many other pastimes
of the Lord in connection with His dealings with the asuras and others. And
in the Tenth Canto the sublime dealing with His conjugal associates the
gopis, as well as with His married wives at Dvaraka, are mentioned. Since
the Lord is absolute, there is no difference in the transcendental nature of
each and every dealing of the Lord. But sometimes people, in an unauthor-
ized hearing process, take more interest in hearing about His
dealings with the gopis. Such an inclination indicates the lusty feelings of
the hearer, so a bona fide speaker of the dealings of the Lord never
indulges in such hearings. One must hear about the Lord from the very
beginning, as in the Srimad-Bhdgavatam or any other scriptures, and that
will help the hearer attain perfection by progressive development. One
should not, therefore, consider that His dealings with the Pandavas are less
important than His dealings with the gopis. We must always remember
that the Lord is always transcendental to all mundane attachment. In all
the above-mentioned dealings of the Lord, He is the hero in all circum-
stances, and hearing about Him or about His devotees or combatants is


--- Page 45 ---

conducive to spiritual life. It is said that the Vedas and Puranas, elc.,
are all made to revive our lost relation with Him. Hearing of all these
scriptures is essential.

0 my Lord, You have executed all duties Yourself. Are you leaving
us today, though we are completely dependent on Your mercy and have
no one else to protect us now when all kings are at enmity with us?
PURPORT
The Pandavas are most fortunate because with all good luck they were
entirely dependent on the mercy of the Lord. In the material world, to be
dependent on the mercy of someone else is the utmost sign of misfortune,
but in the case of our transcendental relation with the Lord, it is the most
fortunate case when we can live completely dependent on Him. The
material disease is due to thinking of becoming independent of everything.
But the cruel material nature does not allow us to become independent.
The false attempt to become independent of the stringent laws of nature


--- Page 46 ---
420 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 8
is known as material advancement of experimental knowledge. The whole
material world is moving on this false attempt of becoming independent of
the laws of nature. Beginning from Ravana, who wanted to prepare a
direct staircase to the planets of heaven, down to the present age, they
are trying to overcome the laws of nature. They are trying now to approach
distant planetary systems by electronic mechanical power. But the highest
goal of human civilization is to work hard under the guidance of the Lord
and become completely dependent on Him. The highest achievement of
perfect civilization is to work with valor but at the same time depend
completely on the Lord. The Pandavas were the ideal executors of this
standard of civilization. Undoubtedly they were completely dependent on
the good will of Lord Sri Krsna, but they were not idle parasites of the
Lord. They were all highly qualified both by personal character and
physical activities. Still they always looked for the mercy of the Lord
because they knew that every living being is dependent by constitutional
position. The perfection of life is, therefore, to become dependent on the
will of the Lord, instead of becoming falsely independent in the material
world. Those who try to become falsely independent of the Lord are
called andtha, or without any guardian, whereas those who are completely
dependent on the will of the Lord are called sandtha, or those having
someone to protect them. Therefore we must try to be 50116110 so that we
can always be protected from the unfavorable condition of material
existence. By the deluding power of the external material nature we forget
that the material condition of life is the most undesirable perplexity. The
Bhagavad-gita therefore directs us (7.19) that after many, many births
one fortunate person becomes aware of the fact that Vasudeva is all in all
and that the best way of leading one’s life is to surrender unto Him
completely. That is the sign of a mahatma. All the members of the
Pandava family were mahatmas in household life. Maharaja Yudhisthira
was the head of these mahatmas, and Queen Kuntidevi was the mother.
The lessons of the Bhagavad-gita and all the Puranas, specifically the
Bhagavata Purana, are therefore inevitably connected with the history of
the Pandava mahatmas. For them, separation from the Lord was just like
the separation of a fish from water. Srimati Kuntidevi, therefore, felt
such separation like a thunderbolt, and the whole prayer of the Queen
is to try to persuade the Lord to stay with them. After the Battle of
Kuruksetra, although the inimical kings were killed, their sons and grand-
sons were still there to deal with the Pandavas. It is not only the Pandavas
who were put into the condition of enmity, but all of us are always in such
a condition, and the best way of living is to become completely dependent

on the will of the Lord and thereby overcome all difficulties of material
existence.

TRANSLATION
As the name and fame of a particular body is finished with the dis-
appearance of the living spirit, similarly if You do not look upon us, all
our fame and activities, along with the Pandavas and Yadus, will end at
once.
PURPORT

Kuntidevi is quite aware that the existence of the Pandavas is due to
Sif Krsna only. The Pandavas are undoubtedly well established in name
and fame and are guided by the great King Yudhisthira, who is morality
personified, and the Yadus are undoubtedly great allies, but without the
guidance of Lord Krsna all of them are nonentities, as much as the senses
of the body are useless without the guidance of consciousness. No one
should be proud of his prestige, power and fame without being guided by
the favor of the Supreme Lord. The living beings are always dependent,
and the ultimate dependable object is the Lord Himself. We may, therefore,
invent by our advancement of material knowledge all sorts of counter-
acting material resources, but without being guided by the Lord all such
inventions end in fiasco, however strong and stout the reactionary elements
may be.

You leave, it will no longer be so.
PURPORT
There are certain particular marks on the feet of the Lord which dis-
tinguish the Lord from others. The marks of a flag, thunderbolt, an
instrument to drive an elephant, umbrella, lotus, disc, etc., are on the
bottom of the Lord’s feet. These marks are impressed upon the soft dust
of the land where the Lord traverses. The land of Hastindpura was thus
marked while Lord Sri Krsna was there with the Pandavas, and the king-
dom of the Pandavas thus flourished by such auspicious signs. Kuntidevi
pointed out the distinguished features and was afraid of ill luck in the
absence of the Lord.

All these cities and villages are flourishing in all respects because the
herbs and grains are in abundance, the trees are full of fruits, the rivers
are flowing, the hills are full of minerals and the oceans full of wealth. And
this is all due to Your glancing over them.
PURPORT
Human prosperity flourishes by natural gifts and not by gigantic
industrial enterprises. The gigantic industrial enterprises are products of a
godless civilization, and they cause the destruction of the noble aims of
human life. The more we go on increasing such troublesome industries to
squeeze out the vital energy of the human being, the more there will be
unrest and dissatisfaction of the people in general, although a few only can
live lavishly by exploitation. The natural gifts such as grains and vegetables,
fruits, rivers, the hills of jewels and minerals, and the seas full of pearls
are supplied by the order of the Supreme, and as He desires, material
nature produces them in abundance or restricts them at times. The natural
law is that the human being may take advantage of these godly gifts by
nature and satisfactorily flourish on them without being captivated by the
exploitative motive of lording it over material nature. The more we attempt
to exploit material nature according to our whims of enjoyment, the more
we shall become entrapped by the reaction of such exploitative attempts. If
we have sufficient grains, fruits, vegetables and herbs, then what is the
necessity of running a slaughterhouse and killing poor animals? A man
need not kill an animal if he has sufficient grains and vegatables to eat. The
flow of river waters fertilizes the fields, and there is more than what we
need. Minerals are produced in the hills and the jewels in the ocean. If the
human civilization has sufficient grains, minerals, jewels, water, milk, etc.,
then why should it hanker after terrible industrial enterprises at the cost
of the labor of some unfortunate men? But all these natural gifts are
dependent on the mercy of the Lord. What we need, therefore, is to be
obedient to the laws of the Lord and achieve human perfection of life by
devotional service. The indications by Kuntidevt are just to the point. She

desires that God’s mercy be bestowed upon them so that natural prosperity
be maintained by His grace.

0 Lord of the universe, soul of the universe, O Personality of the

PURPORT
A pure devotee of the Lord is ashamed to ask anything in self-interest
from the Lord. But the householders are sometimes obliged to ask favors
from the Lord, being bound by the tie of family affection. Srimati Kunti-
devi was conscious of this fact, and, therefore, she prayed to the Lord to
cut off the affectionate tie from her own kinsmen, the Pandavas and the
Vrsnis. The Pandavas are her own sons, and the Vrsnis are the members of
her paternal family. Krsna was equally related to both the families. Both
the families required the Lord’s help because both were dependent devo-
tees of the Lord. Srimati Kuntidevi wished Sri Krsna to remain with her
sons the Pandavas, but by His doing so her paternal house would be
bereft of the benefit. All these partialities troubled the mind of Kunti, and
therefore she desired to cut off the affectionate tie.


--- Page 51 ---
Text 42] Prayers by Queen Kunti 425

A pure devotee cuts off the limited ties of affection for his family and
widens his activities of devotional service for all forgotten souls. The
typical example is the band of six Gosvamis who followed the path of
Lord Caitanya. All of them belonged to the most enlightened and cul-
tured rich families of the higher castes, but for the benefit of the mass of
population they left their comfortable homes and became mendicants. To
cut off all family affection means to broaden the field of activities. With-
out doing this, no one can be qualified as a brahmana, a king, a public
leader or a devotee of the Lord. The Personality of Godhead, as an ideal
King, showed this by example. Sri Ramacandra cut off the tie of affection
of His beloved wife to manifest the qualities of an ideal king.

Such personalities as a brahmana, a devotee, a king or a public leader
must be very broadminded in discharging respective duties. Weak as she
was, Srimati Kuntidevi was conscious of this fact, and she prayed to be
free from such bondage of family affection. The Lord is addressed as the
Lord of the universe, or the Lord of the universal mind, indicating His all-
powerful ability to cut the hard knot of family affection. Therefore, it is
sometimes experienced that the Lord, out of His special affinity towards a
weak devotee, breaks the family affection by force of circumstances by His
all-powerful energy. By doing so He causes the devotee to become com-
pletely dependent on Him and thus clears up the path for his going back to
Godhead.

0 Lord of Madhu, as the Ganges forever flows to the sea, without

diverted to anyone else.
PURPORT

Perfection of pure devotional service is attained when all attention is
diverted towards the transcendental loving service of the Lord. To cut off
the tie of all other affections does not mean complete negation of the finer
elements, like affection for someone else. This is not possible. A living
being, whoever he may be, must have this feeling of affection for others
because this is a symptom of life. The symptoms of life, namely desire,
anger, hankerings, feelings of attraction, etc., cannot be annihilated. Only
the objective has to be changed. Desire cannot be changed, but in devo-
tional service the desire is changed only for the service of the Lord in
place of desire for sense gratification. The so-called affection for family,
society, country, etc., are different phases of sense gratification. When this
desire is changed for the satisfaction of the Lord, it is called devotional
service.

In the Bhagavad-git@ we can see that Arjuna desired not to fight with his
brothers and relations just to satisfy his own personal desires. But when he
heard the message of the Lord, Srimad-Bhagavad-gita, he changed his
decision and served the Lord. And for his doing so, he became a famous
devotee of the Lord, for it is declared in all the scriptures that Arjuna
attained spiritual perfection by devotional service to the Lord in friend-
ship. The fighting was there, the friendship was there, Arjuna was there,
and Krsna was there, but Arjuna became a different person by devotional
service. Therefore, the prayers of Kunti also indicate the same categorical
changes in activities. বলাও Kunti wanted to serve the Lord without
diversion, and that was her prayer. This unalloyed devotion is the ultimate
goal of life. Our attention is usually diverted in the service of something
which is nongodly or not in the program of the Lord. When the program
is changed into the service of the Lord, that is to say when the senses are
purified in relation with the service of the Lord, it is called pure unalloyed
devotional service. प्ता Kuntidevi wanted that perfection and prayed
for it from the Lord.

Her affection for the Pandavas and the Vrsnis is not out of the range of
devotional service because service of the Lord and the service of the


--- Page 53 ---
Text 43] Prayers by Queen Kunti 427
devotees are identical. Sometimes service of the devotee is more valuable
than the service of the Lord. But here the affeetion of Kuntidewi for the
Pandavas and the Vrsnis was due to family relation. This tie of affection in
terms of material relation is the relation of maya because the relations of
the body or the mind are due to the influence of the external energy.
Relations of the soul, established in relation with the Supreme Soul, are
factual relations. When Kuntidevi wanted to cut off the family relation,
she meant to cut off the relation of the skin. The skin relation is the cause
of material bondage, but the relation of the soul is the cause of freedom.
This relation of the soul to the soul can be established by the via medium of
the relation with the Supersoul. Seeing in the darkness is not seeing. But
seeing by the light of the sun means to see the sun and everything else
which was unseen in the darkness. That is the way of devotional service.

A summary of the Supreme Lord Sri Krsna is made herein by 1111
Kuntidevi. The Almighty Lord has His eternal transcendental abode where
He is engaged in keeping surabhi cows. He is served by hundreds and thou-
sands of goddesses of fortune. He descends on the material world to
reclaim His devotees and to annihilate the disturbing elements in groups of
political partiesand kings who are supposed to be in charge of administra-
tion work. He creates, maintains and annihilates by His unlimited energies,
and still He is always full with prowess and does not deteriorate in potency.
The cows, the brahmanas and the devotees of the Lord are all objects of
His special attention because they are very important factors for the
general welfare of living beings.

PURPORT

Anything that is enchanting in the world is said to be a representation
of the Lord. The conditioned souls who are engaged in trying to lord it
over the material world are also enchanted by His mystic powers, but His
devotees are enchanted in a different way by the glories of the Lord, and
His merciful blessings are upon them. His energy is displayed in different
ways, as electrical energy works in manifold capacities. Srimati Kuntidevi
has prayed to the Lord just to enunciate a fragment of His glories. All His
devotees worship Him in that way, by chosen words, and therefore the
Lord is known as uttama-sloka. No amount of chosen words is sufficient
to enumerate the Lord’s glory, and yet He is satisfied by such prayers as
the father is satisfied even by the broken linguistic attempts of the growing
child. The word maya is used both in the sense of delusion and mercy also.
Herein the word maya is used in the sense of the Lord’s mercy upon
Kuntidevi.

No one could make Lord Krsna stay at Hastinapura when He decided to
start for Dvaraka, but the simple request of King Yudhisthira that the Lord
remain there for a few days more was immediately effective. This signifies
that the power of the King is loving affection, which the Lord could not
deny. The almighty God is thus conquered only by loving service and
nothing else. He is fully independent in all His dealings, but He voluntarily
accepts obligations by the loving affection of His pure devotees.

whole world became involved in this fight between the rival brothers.
Lord Krsna was also there in the side of King Yudhisthira. It is said in the
Mahabharata (Adi, Chap. 20) that 6,400,000 men were killed in eighteen
days in the Battle of Kuruksetra, and some hundreds of thousands were
missing. Practically this was the greatest battle in the world within five
thousand years.

This mass killing simply to enthrone Maharaja Yudhisthira was too
mortifying, so he tried to be convinced with evidences from histories
by great sages like Vyasa and the Lord Himself that the fight was just
because the cause was just. But Maharaja Yudhisthira would not be
satisfied, even though he was instructed by the greatest personalities of the
time. Krsna is designated herein as the performer of superhuman actions,
but in this particular instance neither He nor Vyasa could convince King
Yudhisthira. Does it mean that He failed to be a superhuman actor? No,
certainly not. The interpretation is that the Lord as (8৮৫7৫ or the Super-
soul both in the heart of King Yudhisthira and Vyasa performed still more
superhuman action because the Lord desired it. As Supersoul of King
Yudhisthira, He did not allow the King to be convinced by the words of
Vyasa and others, including Himself, because He desired that the King
hear instructions from the dying Bhismadeva, who was another great
devotee of the Lord. The Lord wanted that at the last stage of his material
existence the great warrior Bhismadeva see the Lord personally as well as
his beloved grandchildren, King Yudhisthira, etc., now situated on the
throne, and thus pass away very peacefully. Bhismadeva was not at all
satisfied to fight against the Pandavas, who were his beloved fatherless
grandchildren. But the ksatriyas are also very stern people, and therefore
he was obliged to take the side of Duryodhana because he was maintained
at the expense of Duryodhana. Besides this, the Lord also desired that
King Yudhisthira be pacified by the words of Bhismadeva so that the
world could see that Bhismadeva excelled all in knowledge, including the
Lord Himself.

TRANSLATION
King Yudhisthira, son of Dharma, overwhelmed by the death of his
friends, was aggrieved just like a common, materialistic man. O sages,
thus deluded by affection, he began to speak.
PURPORT
King Yudhisthira, though he was not expected to become aggrieved like
a common man, became deluded by worldly affection by the will of the
Lord (just as Arjuna was apparently deluded). A man who sees knows it well
that the living entity is neither the body nor the mind but is transcendental
to the material conception of life. The common man thinks of violence and
nonviolence in terms of the body, but that is a kind of delusion. Everyone
is duty-bound according to one’s occupational duties. A ksatriya is bound
to fight for the right cause, regardless of the opposite party. In such dis-
charge of duty, one should not be disturbed by annihilation of the material
body, which is only an external dress of the living soul. All this was
perfectly known to Maharaja Yudhisthira, but by the will of the Lord he
became just like a common man because there was another great idea
behind this delusion: the King would be instructed by Bhisma as Arjuna
was instructed by the Lord Himself.

King Yudhisthira said: O my lot! I am the most sinful man! Just see
my heart, which is full of ignorance! This body, which is ultimately
meant for others, has killed many, many phalanxes of men.
PURPORT
A solid phalanx of 21.870 chariots, 21,870 elephants, 109,650 infantry
and 65.600 cavalry is called an aksauhini. And many aksauhinis were Killed
on the Batilefield of Kuruksetra. Maharaja Yudhisthira, as the most pious
King of the world, takes for himself the responsibility of Killing such a
huge number of living beings because the battle was fought to reinstate
him on the throne. This body is. after all, meant for others. While there is
life in the body, it is meant for the service of others, and when it is dead it
is meant te be eaten up by dogs and jackals or maggots. He is sorry because
for such a temporary body such a huge massacre was committed.

434 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 8
PURPORT
Whenever there is a war, there is certainly a massacre of many innocent
living beings, such as boys, brdhmanas and women, whose killing is con-
sidered to be the greatest of sins. They are all innocent creatures, and in all
circumstances killing of them is forbidden in the scriptures. Maharaja
Yudhisthira was aware of these mass killings. Similarly, there were friends,
parents and preceptors also on both sides, and all of them were killed. It
was simply horrible for him to think of such killing, and therefore he was
thinking of residing in hell for millions and billions of years.

PURPORT
Maharaja Yudhisthira thought that although he was not actually
involved in the administration of the kingdom, which was being carried
on well by Duryodhana without harm to the citizens, he caused the killing
of so many living beings only for his personal gain of the kingdom from
the hands of Duryodhana. The killing was committed not in the course of

administration but for the sake of self-aggrandizement, and as such he
thought himself responsible for all the sins.

TRANSLATION

I have killed many friends of women, and I have thus caused enmity to

such an extent that it is not possible to undo it by material welfare work.
PURPORT

The grhamedhis are those whose only business is to perform welfare
work for the sake of material prosperity. Such material prosperity is some-
times hampered by sinful activities, and the materialist is sure to commit
sins, even unintentionally, in course of discharging material duties. To get
relief from such sinful reactions, the Vedas prescribe several kinds of
sacrifices. It is said in the Vedas that by performing the asvamedha yajiia
(horse sacrifice) one can get relief from even brahmahatya (killing of a
brahmana).

Yudhisthira Maharaja performed this asvamedha yajita, but he thinks
that even by performing such yajiias it is not possible to get relief from the
great sins committed. In the war either the husband or the brother or even
the father or sons go to fight. And when they are killed, a fresh enmity is
created, and thus a chain of actions and reactions increases which is not
possible to be counteracted even by thousands of asvamedha yajiias.


--- Page 62 ---
436 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 8
The way of work (karma) is like that. It creates one action and another
reaction simultaneously and thus increases the chain of material activities,
binding the performer in material bondage. In the Bhagavad-gita (Bg. 9.27-
28) the remedy is suggested that such actions and reactions of the path of
work can be checked only when work is done on behalf of the Supreme
Lord. The Battle of Kuruksetra was actually fought by the will of the
Supreme Lord Sri Krsna, as it is evident from His version, and by His will
only Yudhisthira was replaced on the throne of Hastinapura. Therefore,
factually no sin whatsoever touched the Pandavas, who were only the
order carriers of the Lord. For others, who declare war out of personal
interest, the whole responsibility lies on them.

TRANSLATION
As it is not possible to filter muddy water through mud, nor purify

men by sacrificing animals.
PURPORT
Asvamedha yajiias or gomedha yajiias, or the sacrifices in which a horse
or a bull is sacrificed, were not, of course, for the purpose of killing the
animals. Lord Caitanya said that such animals sacrificed on the altar of
yajita were rejuvenated and a new life was given to them. It was just to


--- Page 63 ---
Text 52] Prayers by Queen Kunti 437
prove the efficacy of the hymns of the 16005. By recitation of the hymns
of the Fedas in the proper way, certainly the performer gets relief from the
reactions of sins, but in case of such sacrifices not properly done under
expert management, surely one has to become responsible for animal
sacrifice. In this age of quarrel and hypocrisy there is no possibility of
performing the yajiias perfectly for want of expert brahmanas who are able
to conduct such yajiias. Maharaja Yudhisthira, therefore, gives a hint to
performing sacrifices in the age of Kali. In the Kali-yuga the only sacrifice
recommended is the performance of Harinama yajiia inaugurated by Lord
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. But one should not indulge in animal killing and
counteract it by performing the Harinama yajiia. Those who are devotees
of the Lord never kill an animal for self-interest, and (as the Lord ordered
Arjuna) they do not refrain from performing the duty of a ksatriya. The
whole purpose is, therefore, served when everything is done for the will of
the Lord. This is possible only for the devotees.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports of the First Canto, Eighth Chapter,
of Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled ‘Prayers by Queen Kunti and Pariksit
Saved.”

duties. Bhismadeva will also offer his last prayer to the Lord on the verge
of passing away from this mortal world and thus become liberated from
the bondage of further material engagements. Bhismadeva was endowed
with the power of leaving his material body at will, and his lying down on
the bed of arrows was his own choice. This passing away of the great
warrior attracted the attention of all the contemporary elites, and all of
them assembled there to show their feelings of love, respect and affection
for the great soul.

happy at the time of his death. Kuvera is the richest of all the demigods,
and herein King Yudhisthira appeared like him (Kuvera), for the procession
along with Sri Krsna was quite appropriate to the royalty of King
Yudhisthira.

Lord Krsna was also a younger cousin of Maharaja Yudhisthira as well
as the intimate friend of Arjuna. But all the family members of the
Pandavas knew Lord Krsna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The
Lord, although conscious of His supreme position, always behaved in a
humanly custom, and so He also bowed down before the dying Bhismadeva
as if He were one of the younger brothers of King Yudhisthira.

PURPORT
Parvata Muni is considered to be one of the oldest sages. He is almost
always a constant companion of Narada Muni. They are also spacemen
competent to travel in the air without help of any material vehicle.
Parvata Muni is also a devarsi, or a great sage amongst the demigods, like
Narada. He was present along with Narada at the sacrificial ceremony of
Maharaja Janamejaya, son of Maharaja Pariksit. In this sacrifice all the


--- Page 69 ---
444 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 9
snakes of the world were to be killed. Parvata Muni and Narada Muni are
called Gandharvas also because they can travel in the air singing the glories
of the Lord. As they can travel in the air, they observed the svayarhvara
ceremony (selecting her own husband) of Draupadi from the air. Like
Narada Muni, Parvata Muni also used to visit the royal assembly in the
heaven of King Indra. As a Gandharva, sometimes he visited the royal
assembly of Kuvera, one of the important demigods. Both Narada and
Parvata were once in trouble with the daughter of Maharaja Srhjaya.
Maharaja Sriijaya got the benediction of a son by Parvata Muni.

Narada Muni is inevitably associated with the narrations of the Puranas.
He is described in the Bhagavatam. In his previous life he was the son of a
maidservant, but by good association of pure devotees he became en-
lightened in devotional service, and in the next life he became a perfect
man comparable with himself only. In the Mahabharata his name is
mentioned in many places. He is the principal devargi, or the chief sage
amongst the demigods. He is the son and disciple of Brahmaji, and from
him the disciplic succession in the line of Brahma has been spread. He
initiated Prahlada Maharaja, Dhruva Maharaja and many celebrated devo-
tees of the Lord. He initiated even Vyasadeva, the author of the Vedic
literatures, and from Vyasadeva, Madhvacarya was initiated, and thus the
Madhva-sampradaya, in which the Gaudiya-sampradaya is also included,
has spread all over the universe. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu belonged to
this Madhva-sampradaya; therefore Brahmaji, Narada, Vyasa, down to
Madhva, Caitanya and the Gosvamis all belonged to the same line of
disciplic succession. Naradaji has instructed many kings from time imme-
morial. In the Bhagavatam we can see that he instructed Prahlada Maharaja
while he was in the womb of his mother, and he instructed Vasudeva,
father of Krsna, as well as Maharaja Yudhisthira.

Dhaumya. A great sage who practiced severe penances at Utkochak
Tirtha and was appointed royal priest of the Pandava kings. He acted as
the priest in many religious functions of the Pandavas (5৫775060৫70), but also
each of the Pandavas was attended by him at the betrothal of Draupadi.
He was present even during the exile of the Pandavas and used to advise
them in circumstances when they were perplexed. He instructed them how
to live incognito for one year, and his instructions were strictly followed
by the Pandavas during that time. His name is mentioned also when the
general funeral ceremony was performed after the Battle of Kuruksetra.
In the Anusasana Parva of Mahabharata (Ch. 127.15-16) he gave religious
instructions very elaborately to Maharaja Yudhisthira. He was actually the
right type of priest of a householder, for he could guide the Pandavas on


--- Page 70 ---
Texts 6-7] Bhisma’s Passing Away 445
the right path of religion. A priest is meant for guiding the householder
progressively in the right path of asrama-dharma, or the occupational duty
of a particular caste. There is practically no difference between the family
priest and the spiritual master. The sages, saints and brahmanas were
especially meant for such functions.

Badarayana (Vyasadeva). He is known as Krsna, Krsna-dvaipayana,
Dvaipayana, Satyavatisuta, Parasarya, Parasaratmaja, Badarayana, Veda-
vyasa, etc. He was the son of Mahamuni Parasara in the womb of Satyavati
prior to her betrothal with Maharaja Santanu, the father of the great
general Grandfather Bhismadeva. He is a powerful incarnation of Narayana,
and he broadcasts the Vedic wisdom to the world. As such, Vyasadeva is
offered respects before chanting the Vedic literature, especially the
Puranas. Sukadeva Gosvami was his son, and rsis like Vaisampayana, etc.,
were his disciples for different branches of the Vedas. He is the author of
the great epic Mahabharata and the great transcendental literature
Bhagavatam. The Brahma-sitras or the Vedanta-sitras or Badarayana-
sitras are compiled by him. Amongst sages he is the most respected
author by dint of severe penances. When he wanted to record the great
epic Mahabharata for the welfare of all people in the age of Kali, he was
feeling the necessity of a powerful writer who could take up his dictation.
By the order of Brahmaji, SrT Ganesaji took up the charge of noting down
the dictation on the condition that Vyasadeva would not stop dictation for
a moment. The Mahabharata was thus compiled by the joint endeavor of
Vyasa and Ganesa.

By the order of his mother Satyavati, who was later married to Maharaja
Santanu, and by the request of Bhismadeva, the eldest son of Maharaja
Santanu by his first wife, the Ganges, he begot three brilliant sons whose
names are Dhrtarastra, Pandu and Vidura. The Mahabharata was compiled
by Vyasadeva after the Battle of Kuruksetra and after the death of all the
heroes of Mahabharata. It was first spoken in the royal assembly of
Maharaja Janamejaya, the son of Maharaja Pariksit.

Brhadasva. An ancient sage who used to meet Maharaja Yudhisthira
now and then. First of all he met Maharaja Yudhisthira at Kamyavana.
This sage narrated the history of Maharaja Nala. There is another Brhadasva:
who is the son of the Iksvaku dynasty (Maha. Van. 209.4-5).

Bharadvaja. He is one of the seven great rsis and was present at the time
of the birth ceremony of Arjuna. The powerful rsi sometimes undertook
severe penances on the shore of the Ganges, and his @srama is still cele-
brated at Prayagadhama. It is learned that this rsi, while taking bath in
the Ganges, happened to meet Ghrtacl, one of the beautiful society girls

of heaven, and thus he discharged semina, which was kept and preserved in
an earthen pot and from which Drona was born. So Dronacarya is the son
of Bharadvaja Muni. Others say that Bharadvaja, the father of Drona, is a
different person from Maharsi Bharadvaja. He was a great devotee of
Brahma. Once he approached Dronacarya and requested him to stop the
Battle of Kuruksetra.

Parasurama or Renukasuta. He is the son of Maharsi Jamadagni and
Srimati Renuka. Thus he is also known as Renukasuta. He is one of the
powerful incarnations of God, and he killed the ksatriya community as a
whole twenty-one times. With the blood of the ksatriyas he pleased the
souls of his forefathers. Later on he underwent severe penances at the
Mahendra Parvata. After taking the whole earth from the ksatriyas, he
gave it in charity to Ka$yapa Muni. Paradurama instructed the Dhanur-
veda or the science of fighting to Dronacirya because he happened to be a
brahmana. He was present during the coronation of Maharaja Yudhisthira,
and he celebrated the function along with other great rsis.

Parasurama is so old that he met both Rama and Krsna at different
times. He fought with Rama, but he accepted Krsna as the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. He also praised Arjuna when he saw him with
Krsna. When Bhisma refused to marry Amba, who wanted him to become
her husband, Amba met Paraurama, and by her request only he asked
Bhismadeva to accept her as his wife. Bhisma refused to obey his order,
although he was one of the spiritual masters of Bhismadeva. He fought
with Bhismadeva when he neglected his warning. Both of them fought very
severely, and at last Parasurama was pleased with Bhisma and gave him the
benediction of becoming the greatest fighter in the world.

Vasistha. The great celebrated sage among the brahmanas, well known
as the Brahmarsi Vasisthadeva. He is a prominent figure both in the
Ramayana and Mahabharata periods. He celebrated the coronation cere-
mony of the Personality of Godhead Sri Rama. He was present also on the
Battlefield of Kuruksetra. He could approach all the higher and lower
planets, and his name is also connected with the history of Hiranyakasipu.
There was a great tension between him and Viévamitra, who wanted his
kamadhenu. Vasistha Muni refused to spare his kamadhenu, and for this
Visvamitra killed his one hundred sons. As a perfect brahmana he tolerated
all the taunts of Vidvamitra. Once he tried to commit suicide on account
of Visvamitra’s torture, but all his attempts were unsuccessful. He jumped
from a hill, but the stones on which he fell became a stack of cotton, and
thus he was saved. He jumped into the ocean, but the waves washed him
ashore. He jumped in the river, but the river also washed him ashore. Thus

Texts 6-7] Bhisma’s Passing Away 447
all his suicide attempts were unsuccessful. He is also one of the seven rsis
and husband of Arundhati, the famous star.

Indrapramada. Another celebrated rsi.

Trita. One of the three sons of Prajapati Gautama. He was the third son,
and his other two brothers were known as Ekat and Dvita. All the brothers
were great sages and strict followers of the principles of religion. By dint
of severe penances they were promoted to Brahmaloka (the planet where
Brahmaji lives). Once Trita Muni fell in a well. He was an organizing worker
of many sacrifices, and as one of the great sages he also came to show
respect to Bhismaji at his deathbed. He was one of the seven sages in the
Varunaloka. He hailed from the Western countries of the world. As such,
most probably he belonged to the European countries. At that time the
whole world was under one Vedic culture.

Grtsamada. One of the sages of the heavenly kingdom. He was a close
friend of Indra the King of heaven and was as great as Brhaspati. He used
to visit the royal assembly of Maharaja Yudhisthira, and he also visited the
place where Bhismadeva breathed his last. Sometimes he explained the
glories of Lord Siva before Maharaja Yudhisthira. He was the son of
Vitahavya, and he resembled in features the body of Indra. Sometimes the
enemies of Indra mistook him to be Indra and arrested him. He was a great
scholar of the Rg-veda, and thus he was highly respected by the brahmana
community. He lived a life of celibacy and was powerful in every respect.

Asita. There was a king of the same name, but herein the Asita men-
tioned is the Asita Devala Rsi, a great powerful sage of the time. He
explained to his father 1,500,000 verses from the Mahabharata. He was one
of the members in the snake sacrifice of Maharaja Janamcjaya. He was also
present during the coronation ceremony of Maharaja. Yudhisthira along
with other great rsis. He also gave Maharaja Yudhisthira instructions while
he was on the Afijana Hill. He was also one of the devotees of Lord Siva.

Kaksivan. One of the sons of Gautama Muni and the father of the great
sage Candakausika. He was one of the members of Parliament of Maharaja
Yudhisthira.

Atri. Atri Muni was a great brahmana sage and was one of the mental
sons of Brahmaji. Brahmaji is so powerful that simply by thinking of a son
he can have it. These sons are known as manasa-putras. Out of seven
manasa-putras of Brahmaji and out of the seven great brahmana sages. Atri
was one. In his family the great Pracetas were also born. Atri Muni had
two ksatriya sons who became kings. King Arthama is one of them. He is
counted as one of the twenty-one Prajapatis. His wife’s name was Anasiiya,
and he helped Maharaja Pariksit in his great sacrifices.

448 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 9

Kausika. One of the permanent rsi members in the royal assembly of
Maharaja Yudhisthira. He sometimes met Lord Krsna. There are several
other sages of the same name.

Sudarsana. This wheel which is accepted by the Personality of Godhead
(Visnu or Krsna) as His personal weapon is the most powerful weapon,
greater than the brehmastras or similar other disastrous weapons. In some
of the Vedic literatures it is said that Agnideva, the fire-god, presented
this weapon to Lord Sri Krsna, but factually this weapon is eternally
carried by the Lord. Agnideva presented this weapon to Krsna in the same
way that Rukmini was given by Maharaja Rukma to the Lord. The Lord
accepts such presentations from His devotees, even though such presenta-
tions are eternally His property. There is an elaborate description of this
weapon in the Adi-parva of the Mahabharata. Lord Sri Krsna used this
weapon to kill Sisupala, a rival of the Lord. He also killed Salva by this
weapon, and sometimes He wanted His friend Arjuna to use it to kill his
enemies. (Maha. Virata. 56.3)

And many others like Sukadeva Gosvami and other purified souls,

PURPORT

Sukadeva Gosvami (Brahmarata). The famous son and disciple of Sri

Vyasadeva, who taught him first the Mahabharata and then Srimad-


--- Page 74 ---
Text 8] Bhisma’s Passing Away 449
Bhagavatam. Sukadeva Gosvami recited 1,400,000 verses of the Maha-
bharata in the councils of the Gandharvas, Yaksas and Raksasas, and he
recited Srimad-Bhagavatam for the first time in the presence of Maharaja
Pariksit. He thoroughly studied all the Vedic literatures from his great
father. Thus he was a completely purified soul by dint of his extensive
knowledge in the principles of religion. From Mahabharata (Sabha Parva
4.11) it is understood that he was also present in the royal assembly of
Maharaja Yudhisthira and at the fasting of Maharaja Pariksit. As a bona fide
disciple of इते Vyasadeva, he inquired from his father very extensively about
religious principles and spiritual values, and his great father also satisfied
him by teaching him the yoga system by which one can attain the spiritual
kingdom, the difference between fruitive work and empiric knowledge, the
ways and means of attaining spiritual realization, the four @sramas, namely
the student life, the householder’s life, the retired life and the renounced
life, the sublime position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the
process of seeing Him eye to eye, the bona fide candidate for receiving
knowledge, the consideration of the five elements, the unique position
of intelligence, the consciousness of the material nature and the living
entity, the symptoms of the self-realized soul, the working principles of
the material body, the symptoms of the influential modes of nature, the
tree of perpetual desire, and psychic activities. Sometimes he went to the
sun planet with the permission of his father and Naradaji. Descriptions of
his travel in space are given in the Santi Parva of the Mahabharata (332). At
last he attained the transcendental realm. He is known by different names
like Araneya, Arunisuta, Vaiyasaki, Vyasamataja, etc.

Kasyapa. One of the Prajapatis, the son of Marici and one of the sons-
in-law of Prajapati Daksa. He is the father of the gigantic bird Garuda, who
was given elephants and tortoises as eatables. He married thirteen daughters
of Prajapati Daksa, and their names are Aditi, Diti, Denu, Kela, Danayu,
Singhika, Krodha, Pradha, ४१६५३, Vinata, Kapila, Muni and Kadru. He
begot many children, both demigods and demons, by those wives. From
his first wife, Aditi, all the twelve Adityas were born; one of them is
Viamana, the incarnation of Godhead. This great sage was also present at
the time of Arjuna’s birth. He received a presentation of the whole world
from Parasurama, and later on he asked Parasurama to go out of the world.
His other name is Aristanemi. He lives on the northern side of the
universe.

Angira. He is the son of Maharsi Angira and is known as Brhaspati, the
priest of the demigods. It is said that Dronacarya was his partial incarnation.
Sukracarya was the spiritual master of the demons, and Brhaspati challenged
him. His son is Kacha, and he delivered the fire weapon first to Bharadvaja


--- Page 75 ---
450 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 9
Muni. He begot six sons (like the fire-god) by his wife Candramasi, one
of the reputed stars. He could travel in space, and therefore he could
present himself even in the planets of Brahmaloka and Indraloka. He
advised the King of heaven, Indra, about conquering the demons. Once
he cursed Indra, who thus had to become a hog on the earth and was
unwilling to return to heaven. Such is the power of the attraction of the
illusory energy. Even a hog does not wish to part with its earthly posses-
sions in exchange of a heavenly kingdom. He was the religious preceptor
of the natives of different planets.

Bhismadeva, who was the best amongst the eight Vasas, received and
welcomed all the great and powerful rsis who were assembled there, for he
knew perfectly all the religious principles according to time and place.
PURPORT

Expert religionists know perfectly well how to adjust religious principles
in terms of time and place. All the great dcaryas or religious preachers or
reformers of the world executed their mission by adjustment of religious
principles in terms of time and place. There are different climates and
situations in different parts of the world, and if one has to discharge his
duties to preach the message of the Lord, he must be expert in adjusting

Text 10] Bhigma’s Passing Away 451
things in terms of the time and place. Bhismadeva was one of the twelve
great authorities of preaching this cult of devotional service, and therefore
he could receive and welcome all the powerful sages from all parts of the
universe assembled there at his deathbed. He was certainly unable at that
time to welcome and receive them physically because he was neither at his
home nor in a normal healthy condition. But he was quite fit by the
activities of his sound mind, and therefore he could utter sweet words with
hearty expressions, and all of them were well received. One can perform
one’s duty by physical work, by mind and by words. And he knew well
how to utilize them in the proper place, and therefore there was no
difficulty for him to receive them, although physically unfit.

The sons of Maharaja Pandu were sitting silently nearby, overtaken
with affection for their dying grandfather. Seeing this, Bhismadeva
congratulated them with feeling. There were tears of ecstasy in his eyes,
for he was overwhelmed by love and affection.
PURPORT
When Maharaja Pandu died, his sons were all small children, and natu-
rally they were brought up under the affection of elderly members of the
royal family, specifically by Bhismadeva. Later on when the Pandavas
were grown up they were cheated by cunning Duryodhana and company,
and Bhismadeva, although he knew that the Pandavas were innocent and
were unnecessarily put into trouble, could not take the side of the
Pandavas for political reasons. At the last stage of his life, when Bhismadeva
saw his most exalted grandsons headed by Maharaja Yudhisthira sitting
very gently at his side, the great warrior grandfather could not check his
loving tears, which were automatically flowing from his eyes. He remem-
bered the great tribulations suffered by his most pious grandsons. Certainly

he was the most satisfied man because of Yudhisthira’s being enthroned
in place of Duryodhana, and thus he began to congratulate them.

Bhismadeva said: Oh, what terrible sufferings and what terrible
injustices you good souls suffer for being the sons of religion personified.
You did not deserve to remain alive under those tribulations, yet you
were protected by the brahmanas, God and religion.
PURPORT
Maharaja Yudhisthira was disturbed due to the great massacre in the
Battle of Kuruksetra. Bhismadeva could understand this, and therefore he
spoke first of the terrible sufferings of Maharaja Yudhisthira. He was put
into difficulty by injustice only, and the Battle of Kuruksetra was fought
just to counteract this injustice. Therefore, he should not regret the great
massacre. He wanted to point out particularly that they were always
protected by the brahmanas, the Lord and religious principles. As long as
they were protected by these three important items, there was no cause of
disappointment. Thus Bhismadeva encouraged Maharaja Yudhisthira to
dissipate his despondency. As long as a person is fully in cooperation with
the wishes of the Lord, guided by the bona fide brahmanas and Vaisnavas
and strictly following religious principles, one has no cause for despondency,

however trying the circumstances of life. Bhismadeva, as one of the
authorities in the line, wanted to impress this point upon the Pandavas.

As far as my daughter-in-law Kunti is concerned, upon the great
General Pandu’s death, she became a widow with many children, and
therefore she suffered greatly. And when you were grown up she
suffered a great deal also because of your actions.
PURPORT
The sufferings of Kuntidevi are doubly lamented. She suffered greatly
because of early widowhood and to get her minor children brought up in
the royal family. And when her children were grown up, she continued to
suffer because of her sons’ actions. So her sufferings continued. This means
that she was destined to suffer by providence, and this one has to tolerate
without being disturbed.

TRANSLATION
In my opinion, this is all due to inevitable time, under whose control
everyone in every planet is carried, just as the clouds are carried by the
wind.
PURPORT

There is control of time all over the space within the universe, as there
is control of time all over the planets. All the big gigantic planets, including
the sun, are being controlled by the force of air. as the clouds are carried
by the force of air. Similarly, the inevitable kala, or time, controls even
the action of the air and other elements. Everything is, therefore. con-
trolled by the supreme kala. a forceful representative of the Lord within
the material world. Thus Yudhisthira should not be sorry for the incon-
ceivable action of time. Everyone has to bear the actions and reactions of
time as long as one is within the conditions of the material world.
Yudhisthira should not think that he had committed sins in his previous
birth and is suffering the consequence. Even the most pious has to suffer
the condition of material nature. But a pious man is faithful to the Lord,
for he is guided by the bona fide brahmana and Vaisnava following the
religious principles. These three guiding principles should be the aim of
life. One should not be disturbed by the tricks of cternal time. Even the
great controller of the universe, Brahmaji, is also under the control of that
time; no one should, therefore, grudge being thus controlled by time,
despite being a true follower of religious principles.

TRANSLATION

O how wonderful is the influence of inevitable time. It is irreversible
—otherwise, how can there be reverses in the presence of King Yudhisthira,
the son of the demigod controlling religion, Bhima, the great fighter with
a club, the great bowman Arjuna with his mighty weapon Gandiva, and
above all, the Lord, the direct well-wisher of the Pandavas?

PURPORT

As far as material or spiritual resources were required, there was no
scarcity in the case of the Pandavas. Materially they were well equipped
because two great warriors, namely Bhima and Arjuna, were there.
Spiritually the King himself was the symbol of religion, and above all of
them the Personality of Godhead Lord Sri Krsna was personally concerned
with their affairs as the well-wisher. And yet there were so many reverses
on the side of the Pandavas. Despite the power of pious acts, the power of
personalities, the power of expert management and the power of weapons
under the direct supervision of Lord Krsna, the Pandavas suffered so many
practical reverses, which can only be explained as due to the influence of
kala, the inevitable time. Kala is identical with the Lord Himself, and
therefore the influence of kala indicates the inexplicable wish of the Lord
Himself. There is nothing to be lamented when a matter is beyond the
control of any human being.

TRANSLATION
0 King, no one can know the plan of the Lord [Sri Krsna]. Even
though great philosophers inquire exhaustively, they are bewildered.
PURPORT
The bewilderment of Maharaja Yudhisthira over his past sinful acts and
the resultant sufferings, etc., is completely negated by a great authority
like Bhisma (one of the twelve authorized persons). Bhisma wanted to
impress upon Maharaja Yudhisthira that since time immemorial no one,
including such demigods as Siva and Brahma, could ascertain the real
plan of the Lord. So what can we understand about it? It is useless also to
inquire about it. Even the exhaustive philosophical inquiries of sages
cannot ascertain the plan of the Lord. The best policy is simply to abide
by the orders of the Lord without argument. The sufferings of the
Pandavas are never due to their past deeds. The Lord had to execute the
plan of establishing the kingdom of virtue, and therefore His own devotees
suffered temporarily in order to establish the conquest of virtue. Bhisma-
deva was certainly satisfied by seeing the triumph of virtue, and he was
glad to see King Yudhisthira on the throne, although he himself fought
against him. Even a great fighter like Bhisma could not win the Battle of
Kuruksetra because the Lord wanted to show that vice cannot conquer
virtue, regardless of who tries to execute it. Bhismadeva was a great
devotee of the Lord, but he chose to fight against the Pandavas by the will
of the Lord because the Lord wanted to show that a fighter like Bhisma
cannot win on the wrong side.

TRANSLATION

0 best amongst the descendants of Bharata [ Yudhisthira], I maintain,
therefore, that all this is within the plan of the Lord. Accepting the
inconceivable plan of the Lord, you must follow it. You are now the
appointed administrative head, and my lord, you should now take care of
those subjects who are now rendered helpless.

PURPORT

The popular saying is that a housewife teaches the daughter-in-law by
teaching the daughter. Similarly, the Lord teaches the world by teaching
the devotee. The devotee does not have to learn anything new from the
Lord because the Lord teaches the sincere devotee always from within.
Whenever, therefore, a show is made to teach the devotee, as it was in the
case of teaching the Bhagavad-gita, it is for teaching the less intelli-
gent men. A devotee’s duty is, therefore, to ungrudgingly accept
tribulations from the Lord as a benediction. The Pandavas are advised
by Bhismadeva to accept the responsibility of administration without
hesitation. The poor subjects were without protection due to the Battle
of Kuruksetra, and they were awaiting the assumption of power by
Maharaja Yudhisthira. A pure devotee of the Lord accepts tribulations as
favors from the Lord. Since the Lord is absolute, there is no mundane
difference between the two.

PURPORT

The Vedic system of acquiring knowledge is the deductive process. The
Vedic knowledge is received perfectly by disciplic succession from
authorities. Such knowledge is never dogmatic, as is ill-conceived by less
intelligent persons. The mother is the authority to verify the identity of
the father. She is the authority for such confidential knowledge. Therefore,
authority is not dogmatic. In the Bhagavad-gita this truth is confirmed in
the Fourth Chapter (Bg. 4.2), and the perfect system of learning is to
receive it from authority. The very same system is accepted universally
as truth, but only the false arguer speaks against this system. For example,
modern spacecraft fly in the sky, and they say that they travel to the other
side of the moon, and men believe these stories blindly because they have
accepted the modern scientists as authorities. The authorities speak, and
the people in general believe them. But in the case of Vedic truths, they
have been taught not to believe. Even if they accept them they give a
different interpretation. Each and every man wants a direct perception of
Vedic knowledge, but foolishly they deny it. This means that the
misguided man can believe one authority, the scientist, but will reject the
authority of the Vedas. The result is that people have degenerated.

Here is an authority speaking about Sri Krsna as the original Personality
of Godhead and the first Narayana. Even an impersonalist like Acarya
Sarikara has said in the beginning of his commentation on the Bhagavad-


--- Page 85 ---
460 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 9
gita* that Narayana the Personality of Godhead is beyond the material
creation. The universe is one of the material creations, but Narayana is
transcendental to such material paraphernalia.

Bhismadeva is one of the twelve mahdjanas who know the principles
of transcendental knowledge. His confirmation of Lord Sri Krsna’s being
the original Personality of Godhead is also corroborated by the imperson-
alist Sankara. All other acaryas have also confirmed this statement, and
thus there is no chance of not accepting Lord Sri Krsna as the original
Personality of Godhead. Bhismadeva says that He is the first Narayana.
This is also confirmed by Brahmaji in the Bhagavatam (10.14.14). Krsna
is the first Narayana. In the spiritual world (Vaikunthas) there are un-
limited numbers of Narayanas, who are all the same Personality of
Godhead and are considered to be the plenary expansions of the original
Personality of Godhead Sri Krsna. The first form of the Lord Sri Krsna
first expands Himself as the form of Baladeva, and Baladeva expands in so
many other forms, such as Sankarsana, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, Vasudeva,
Narayana, Purusa, Rama, Nrsimha, etc. All these expansions are one and
the same Vispu-tattva, and Sri Krsna is the original source of all the
plenary expansions. He is, therefore, the direct Personality of Godhead.
He is the creator of the material world, and He is the predominating
Deity known as Narayana in all the Vaikuntha planets. Therefore, His
movements amongst human beings is another sort of bewilderment. The
Lord therefore says in the Bhagavad-gita that foolish persons consider
Him to be one of the human beings without knowing the intricacies of
His movements.

The bewilderment regarding Sri Krsna is due to the action of His two-
fold internal and external energies upon the third one, called marginal
energy. The living entities are expansions of His marginal energy, and thus
they are sometimes bewildered by the internal energy and sometimes
by the external energy. By internal energetic bewilderment, Sri Krsna ex-
pands Himself into unlimited numbers of Narayanas and exchanges or
accepts transcendental loving service from the living entities in the tran-
scendental world. And by His external energetic expansions, He incarnates
Himself in the material world amongst the men, animals or demigods to
reestablish His forgotten relation with the living entities in different species
of life. Great authorities like Bhisma, however, escape His bewilderment by
the mercy of the Lord.

TRANSLATION
0 King, Lord Siva, Narada, the sage amongst the demigods, and
Kapila, the incarnation of Godhead, all know very confidentially about
His glories through direct contact.
PURPORT
Pure devotees of the Lord are all bhavas, or persons who know the
glories of the Lord in different transcendental loving services. As the Lord
has innumerable expansions of His plenary form, similarly there are
innumerable pure devotees of the Lord who are engaged in the exchange of
service of different humors. Ordinarily there are twelve great devotees of
the Lord, namely Brahma, Narada, Siva, Kumara, Kapila, Manu, Prahlada,
Bhisma, Janaka, Sukadeva Gosvami, Bali Maharaja and Yamaraja. Bhisma-
deva, although one of them, has mentioned only three important names
of the twelve who know the glories of the Lord. According to Srila
Visvanatha Cakravartl Thakur, one of the great acaryas in the modern age,
anubhava, or the glory of the Lord, is first appreciated by the devotee in
ecstasy manifesting the symptoms of perspiring, trembling, weeping, bodily
eruptions, etc., which are further enhanced by steady understanding of
the glories of the Lord. Such different understandings of bhavas are ex-
changed between Yasoda and the Lord (binding the Lord by ropes) and in
the chariot driving by the Lord in the exchange of love with Arjuna, etc.
These glories of the Lord are exhibited in His being subordinated before
His devotees, and that is another feature of the glories of the Lord. Suka-
deva Gosvami and the Kumaras, although situated in the transcendental


--- Page 87 ---
462 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 9
position, became converted by another feature of bhava and turned into
pure devotees of the Lord. Tribulations of the devotees by the Lord
constitute another exchange of transcendental bhava between the Lord and
the devotees. The Lord says (Bhag. 10), “1 put My devotee into difficulty,
and thus the devotee becomes more purified in exchanging transcendental
bhava with Me.” Placing the devotee into material troubles necessitates
delivering him from the illusory material relations. The material relations
are based on reciprocation of material enjoyment, which depends mainly
on material resources. Therefore. when material resources are withdrawn
by the Lord, the devotee is cent percent attracted towards transcendental
loving service of the Lord. Thus the Lord snatches the fallen soul from the
mire of material existence. Tribulations offered by the Lord to His devotee
are different from the tribulations resulting from vicious action. All these
glories of the Lord are especially known to the great mandjanas like
Brahma, Siva, Narada, Kapila, Kumira and Bhigsma, as mentioned above,
and one is able to grasp it by their grace.

upon His unalloyed devotees, He accepts all kinds of service, but that does

think of Him as an ordinary man is the grossest type of ignorance.

Being the Absolute Personality of Godhead, He is present in every-

inebriety. He is equibalanced.
PURPORT
Being absolute, there is nothing different from Him. He is kaivalya;
there is nothing except Himself. Everything and everyone is the manifes-
tation of His energy, and thus He is present everywhere by His energy,
being nondifferent from it. The sun is identified with every inch of the sun
rays and every molecular particle of the rays. Similarly, the Lord is distrib-
uted by His different energies. He is Paramatma or the Supersoul, present
in everyone as the supreme guidance, and therefore He is already the
chariot driver and counsel of all living beings. When He, therefore, ex-
hibits Himself as chariot driver of Arjuna, there is no change in His
exalted position. It is the power of devotional service only that demon-
strates Him as the chariot driver or the messenger. Since He has nothing to


--- Page 89 ---
464 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 9
do with the material conception of life because He is absolute spiritual
identity, there is for Him no superior or inferior action. Being the Ab-
solute Personality of Godhead, He has no false ego, and so He does not
identify Himself with anything different from Him. The material con-
ception of ego is equibalanced in Him. He does not feel, therefore, in-
ferior by becoming the chariot driver of His pure devotee. It is the glory
of the pure devotee only that he can bring about service from the affec-
tionate Lord.

PURPORT

The Supreme Lord Absolute Personality of Godhead Sri Krsna, although
equal to everyone, is still more inclined to His unflinching devotee who is
completely surrendered and knows no one else as his protector and master.
Having unflinching faith in the Supreme Lord as one’s protector, friend
and master is the natural condition of eternal life. A living entity is so
made by the will of the Almighty that he is most happy when placing
himself in a condition of absolute dependence.

The opposite tendency is the cause of falldown. The living entity has
this tendency of falling down by dint of misidentifying himself as fully


--- Page 90 ---
Text 23] Bhigma’s Passing Away 465
independent to lord it over the material world. The root cause of all
troubles is there in false egoism. One must draw towards the Lord in all
circumstances.

The appearance of Lord Krsna at the deathbed of Bhismaji is due to
his being an unflinching devotee of the Lord. Arjuna had some bodily
relation with Krsna because the Lord happened to be his maternal cousin.
But Bhisma had no such bodily relation. Therefore the cause of attraction
was due to the intimate relation of the soul. Yet because the relation of
the body is very pleasing and natural, the Lord is more pleased when He
is addressed as the son of Maharaja Nanda, the son of % ৪৪০০3, the lover of
Radharani. This affinity by bodily relation with the Lord is another
feature of reciprocating loving service to the Lord. Bhismadeva is con-
scious of this sweetness of transcendental humor, and therefore he likes
to address the Lord as Vijaya Sakhe, Partha Sakhe, etc., exactly like
Nanda-Nandana or Yasoda-Nandana. The best way to establish our rela-
tion in transcendental sweetnessis to approach Him through His recognized
devotees. One should not try to establish the relation directly; there must
be a via medium which is transparent and competent to lead us to the
right path.

466 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 9
PURPORT
Yoga means concentration of the mind detached from all other subject
matter. And actually such concentration is samadhi, or cent percent
engagement in the service of the Lord. And one who concenirates his
attention in that manner is called a yogi. Such a yogi devotee of the Lord
engages himself twenty-four hours daily in the service of the Lord so that
his whole attention is engrossed with the thoughts of the Lord in ninefold
devotional service, namely hearing, chanting, remembering, worshiping,
praying, becoming a voluntary servant. carrying out orders, establishing
friendly relationship, or offering all that one may possess, in the service of
the Lord. By such practice of yoga or linking up in the service of the Lord,
one is recognized by the Lord Himself, as it is explained in the Bhagcvad-
gita concerning the highest perfectional stage of samadhi. The Lord calls
such a rare devotee the best amongst all the yogis. Such a perfect yogi is
enabled by the divine grace of the Lord to concentrate his mind upon the
Lord with a perfect sense of consciousness, and thus by chanting His holy
name before quitting the body the yogi is at once transferred by the
internal energy of the Lord to one of the eternal planets where there is no
question of material life and its concomitant factors. In material existence
a living being has to endure the material conditions of threefold miseries,
life after life, according to his fruitive work. Such material life is produced
by material desires only. Devotional service of the Lord does not kill the
natural desires of the living being, but they are applied in the right cause
of devotional service. This qualifies the desire to be transferred in the
spiritual sky. General Bhismadeva is referring to a particular type of yoga
called bhakti-yoga, and he was fortunate enough to have the Lord directly
in his presence before he quitted his material body. He therefore desired
that the Lord stay before his view in the following verses.

May my Lord, who is four-handed and whose beautifully decorated
lotus face, with eyes as red as the rising sun, is smiling, kindly await me at
that moment when [ quit this material body.
PURPORT
Bhismadeva knew well that Lord Krsna is the original Narayana. His
worshipable Deity was four-handed Narayana, but he knew that four-
handed Narayana is a plenary expansion of Lord Krsna. Indirectly he
desired Lord Sri Krsna to manifest Himself in His four-handed feature of
Narayana. A Vaisnava is always humble in his behavior. Although it was
cent percent certain that Bhismadeva was approaching Vaikuntha-dhama
just after leaving his material body, still as a humble Vaisnava he desired
to see the beautiful face of the Lord, for after quitting the present body
he might not be in a position to see the Lord any more. A Vaisnava is not
puffed up, although the Lord guarantees His pure devotee entrance into
His abode. Here Bhismadeva says, “as long as I do not quit this body.”
This means that the great General would quit the body by his own will;
he was not being forced by the laws of nature. He was so powerful that he
could stay in his body as long as he desired. 116 got this benediction from
his father. He desired that the Lord stay before him in His four-handed
Narayana feature so that he might concentrate upon Him and thus be in
trance in that meditation. Then his mind might be sanctified with thinking
of the Lord. Thus he did not mind wherever he might go. A pure devotee
is never very anxious to go back to the kingdom of God. He entirely de-
pends on the good will of the Lord. He is equally satisfied even if the Lord
desires him to go to hell. The only desire that a pure devotee entertains
is that he may always be in rapt attention with thinking of the lotus feet
of the Lord, regardless. Bhismadeva wanted this much only: that his mind
be absorbed in thinking of the Lord and that he pass away thus. That is the
highest ambition of a pure devotee.

Suta Gosvami said: Maharaja Yudhisthira, after hearing Bhismadeva
speak in that appealing tone, asked him, in the presence of all the great
rsis, about the essential principles of various religious duties.
PURPORT
Bhismadeva, speaking in that appealing tone, convinced Maharaja
Yudhisthira that he was very soon passing away. And Maharaja Yudhisthira
was inspired by Lord Sri Krsna to ask him of the principles of religion.
Lord Sri Krsna inspired Maharaja Yudhisthira to ask Bhismadeva in the
presence of many great sages, indicating thereby that the Lord’s devotee
like Bhismadeva, although apparently living as a worldly man, is far
superior to many great sages, even Vyasadeva. Another point is that
Bhismadeva at that time was not only lying on a deathbed of arrows, but
he was greatly aggrieved because of that state. One should not have
asked him any question at that time, but Lord Sri Krsna wanted to prove
that His pure devotees are always sound in body and mind by dint of
spiritual enlightenment, and thus in any circumstances a devotee of the
Lord is in perfect order to speak of the right way of life. Yudhisthira also
preferred to solve his problematic questions from Bhismadeva rather than
ask anyone else present there who was seemingly more learned than

Bhismadeva. This is all due to the arrangement of the great wheel-carrier
Lord Sri Krsna, who establishes the glories of His devotee. The father
likes to see the son become more famous than himself. The I.ord declares
very emphatically that worship of His devotee is more valuable than the
worship of the Lord Himself.

TRANSLATION
At Maharaja Yudhisthira’s inquiry, Bhismadeva first of all defined all
the classifications of castes and orders of life in terms of the individuals
qualifications. Then he systematically, in twofold divisions, described
counteraction by detachment and interaction by attachment.
PURPORT

The conception of four castes and four orders of life, as planned by the
Lord Himself (Bg. 4.13) is to accelerate transcendental qualities of the
individual person so that he may gradually realize his spiritual identification
and thus act accordingly to get free from material bondage or conditional
life. In almost all the Puranas the subject matter is described in the same
spirit, and so also in the Mahabharata-itis more elaborately described by
Bhismadeva in the Santi-parva beginning from the Sixtieth Chapter.

The varpasrama-dharma is prescribed for the civilized human being just
to train him to successfully terminate human life. Self-realization is


--- Page 95 ---
470 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 9
distinguished from the life of the lower animals engaged in eating, sleeping,
fearing and mating. Bhismadeva advised for all human beings nine qualifi-
cations: 1) not to become angry, 2) not to lie, 3) to equally distribute
wealth, 4) to forgive, 5) to beget children only by one’s legitimate wife,
6) to be pure in mind and hygenic in body. 7) not to be inimical toward
anyone, 8) to be simple, and 9) to support servants or subordinates. One
cannot be called a civilized person without acquiring the above-mentioned
preliminary qualities. Besides these, the brahmanas or the intelligent men,
the administrative men, the mercantile community and the laborer class
must acquire special qualities in terms of occupational duties mentioned
in all the Vedic scriptures. For the intelligent men, controlling the senses
is the most essential qualification, which is the basis of morality. Sex
indulgence even with a legitimate wife must also be controlled, and thereby
family control will automatically follow. An intelligent man abuses his
great qualifications if he does not follow the Vedic way of life. This means
he must seriously make a study of the Vedic literatures, especially of the
Srimad-Bhagavatam and the Bhagavad-gita. For learning Vedic knowledge.
one must approach a person who is cent percent engaged in devotional
service. He must not do things which are forbidden in the 5251705. A person
cannot be a teacher if he drinks or smokes. In the modern system of
education the teacher's academic qualification is taken into consideration
without evaluation of his moral life. Therefore, the result of education is
misuse of high intelligence in so many ways.

The ksatriyas or the administrative class is especially advised to give in
charity and not toaccept charity in any circumstances. Modern administra-
tors raise subscriptions for some political functions, but never give in
charity to the citizens in any state function. It is just the reverse in the
injunctions of the sastras. The administrative class must be well versed in
the sustras, but must not take to the profession of teachers. The adminis-
trators should never pretend to become nonviolent and thereby go to hell.
When Arjuna wanted to become a nonviolent coward in the Battlefield
of Kuruksetra, he was severely chastised by Lord Krsna. The Lord de-
graded Arjuna at that time to the status of an uncivilized man for his
avowed acceptance of the cult of nonviolence. The administrative class
must be personally trained in the military education. Cowards should not
be elevated to the presidential throne by dint of numerical votes only.
The monarchs were all chivalrous personalities, and therefore monarchy
should be maintained provided the monarch is regularly trained in the
occupational duties of a king. In fighting, the king or the president should
never return home without being hurt by the enemy. The so-called king of


--- Page 96 ---
Text 26] Bhisma’s Passing Away 471
today never visits the warfield. He is very much expert in artificially
encouraging the fighting strength in the hope of false national prestige.
As soon as the administrative class is turned into a gang of mercantile and
laborer men, the whole machinery of government becomes polluted.

The vaisyas or the mercantile communities are especially advised to pro-
tect the cows. Cow protection means increasing the milk productions,
namely curd and butter. Agriculture and distribution of the foodstuff are
the primary duties of the mercantile community backed by education in
Vedic knowledge and trained to give in charity. As the ksatriyas were given
charge of the protection of the citizens, vaisyas were given the charge of the
protection of animals. Animals are never meant to be Killed. Killing of
animals is a symptom of barbarian society. For a human being, agricultural
produce, fruits and milk are sufficient and compatible foodstuffs. The
human society should give more attention to animal protection. The pro-
ductive energy of the laborer is misused when he is occupied by industrial
enterprises. Industry of various types cannot produce the essential needs
of man, namely rice, wheat, grains, milk, fruits and vegetables. The pro-
duction of machines and machine tools increases the artificial living
fashion of a class of vested interests and keeps thousands of men in
starvation and unrest. This should not be the standard of civilization.

The sudra class is less intelligent, and they have no independence. They
are meant for rendering sincere service to the three higher sections of the
society. The sudra class can attain all comforts of life simply by rendering
service to the higher classes. It is especially enjoined that a sudra should
never bank money. As soon as the sudras accumulate wealth, it will be
misused for sinful activities in wine, women and gambling. Wine. women
and gambling indicate that the population is degraded into less than sudra
quality. The higher castes should always look after the maintenance of
the sudras, and they should provide them with old and used garments. A
sudra should not leave his master when the master is old and invalid, and
the master should keep the servants satisfied in all respects. The sudras
must first of all be satisfied by sumptuous food and clothing before any
sacrifice is performed. In this age so many functions are held by spending
millions, but the poor laborer is not sumptuously fed or given charity,
clothing, etc. The laborers are thus dissatisfied, and so they make agitation.

The varnas are, so to speak, classifications of different occupations, and
asrama-dharma is gradual progress on the path of self-realization. Both are
interrelated, and one is dependent on the other. The main purpose of
asrama-dharma is to awaken knowledge and detachment. The brahmacart
asrama is the training ground for the prospective candidates. In this


--- Page 97 ---
472 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 9
asrama it is instructed that this material world is not actually the home of
the living being. The conditioned souls under material bondage are prison-
ers of matter, and therefore self-realization is the ultimate aim of life. The
whole system of asrama-dharma is a means to detachment. One who fails
to assimilate this spirit of detachment is allowed to enter into family life
with the same spirit of detachment. Therefore, one who attains detach-
ment may at once adopt the fourth order. namely, renounced, and thus
live on charity only, not to accumulate wealth, but just to keep body and
soul together for ultimate realization. Household life is for one who is
attached, and the vanaprastha and sannyasa orders of life are for those who
are detached from material life. The brahmacari-asrama is especially meant
for training both the attached and detached.

general functions of all the @sramas or orders of life on the path of self-
realization. In the brahmacart life the training is sufficiently imparted to
understand that the world as property belongs to the Supreme Lord, the
Personality of Godhead. No one, therefore, can claim to be the proprietor
of anything in the world. Therefore, in the life of a householder, which is
a sort of license for sex enjoyment, one must give in charity for the service
of the Lord. Everyone’s energy is generated or borrowed from the reser-
voir of energy of the Lord; therefore, the resultant actions of such energy
must be given to the Lord in the shape of transcendental loving service for
Him. As the rivers draw water from the sea through the clouds and again
go down to the sea, similarly our energy is borrowed from the supreme
source, the Lord’s energy, and it must return to the Lord. That is the per-
fection of our energy. The Lord, therefore, in the Bhagavad-gita (Bg. 9.27)
says that whatever we do, whatever we undergo as penance, whatever we
sacrifice, whatever we eat or whatever we give in charity must be offered
to Him (the Lord). That is the way of utilizing our borrowed energy. When
our energy is utilized in that way, our energy is purified from the contami-
nation of material inebrieties, and thus we become fit for our original
natural life of service to the Lord.

Raja-dharma is a great science, unlike modern diplomacy for political
supremacy. The kings were trained systematically to become munificent
and not merely tax collectors. They were trained to perform different
sacrifices only for the prosperity of the subjects. To lead the prajas to the
attainment of salvation was a great duty of the king. The father, the
spiritual master and the king are not to become irresponsible in the
matter of leading their subjects to the path of ultimate liberation from
birth, death, diseases and old age. When these primary duties are properly
discharged, there is no need of government of the people, by the people.
In modern days the people in general occupy the administration by the
strength of manipulated votes, but they are never trained in the primary
duties of the king, and that is also not possible for everyone. Under the
circumstances the untrained administrators play havoc to make the sub-
jects happy in all respects. On the other hand, these untrained adminis-
trators gradually become rogues and thieves and increase the taxation to
finance a top-heavy administration that is useless for all purposes. Actually
the qualified brahmanas are meant to give direction to the kings for proper
administration in terms of the scriptures like the Manu-sarithita and
Dharma-sastras of Parasara. A typical king is the ideal of the people in
general, and if the king is pious, religious, chivalrous and munificent, the


--- Page 99 ---
474 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 9
citizens generally follow him. Such a king is not a lazy sensuous person
living at the cost of the subjects, but alert always to Kill thieves and
dacoits. The pious kings were not merciful to dacoits and thieves in the
name of nonsensical ahirisa. The thieves and dacoits were punished in an
exemplary way so that in the future no one would dare commit such
nuisances in an organized form. Such thieves and dacoits were never meant
for administration as they are now.

The taxation law was simple. There was no force, no encroachment. The
king had a right to take one fourth of the production made by the subject.
The king had a right to claim a fourth of one’s allotted wealth. One woukl
never grudge to part with it because due to the pious king and religious
harmony there was enough natural wealth, namely grains, fruits, flowers,
silk. cotton, milk, jewels, minerals, etc., and therefore, no one was mate-
rially unhappy. The citizens were rich in agriculture and animal husbandry.
and therefore they had enough grains, fruits and milk without any artificial
needs of soaps and toilets, cinemas and bars.

The king had to see that the reserved energy of humanity was properly
utilized. Human energy is not exactly meant for fulfilling animal propen-
sities, but for self-realization. The whole government was specifically de-
signed to fulfili this particular purpose. As such, the king had to select
properly the cabinet ministers, but not on the strength of voting back-
ground. The ministers, the military commanders or even the ordinary
soldiers were all selected by personal qualification, and the King had
to supervise them properly before they were appointed to their respec-
tive posts. The King was especially vigilant to see that the tapasvis,
or persons who sacrificed everything for disseminating spiritual knowledge.
were never disregarded. They knew well that the Supreme Lord Personality
of Godhead never tolerates any insult to His unalloyed devotees. Such
tapasvis were trusted leaders even of the rogues and thieves, who would
never disobey the orders of tapasnis. The king would give special protec-
tion to illiterates, the helpless and widows of the state. Defense measures
were arranged previous to any attack by the enemies. The taxing process
was easy, and it was not meant for squandering, but was for strengthening
the reserve fund. The soldiers were recruited from all parts of the world,
and they were trained for special duties.

As far as salvation is concerned, one has to conquer the principles of
lust. anger. unlawful desires, avarice and bewilderment. To get freedom
from anger, one should learn how to forgive. One should not make plans
in order to be free from unlawful desires. By spiritual culture one is able
to conquer sleep. By tolerance only can one conquer desires and avarice.

Text 28) Bhisma’s Passing Away 475
Disturbances from various diseases can be avoided by regulated diets. By
self-control one can be free from false hopes, and money can be saved by
avoiding undesirable association. By practice of yoga one can control
hunger, and worldliness can be avoided by culturing the knowledge of
impermanence. Dizziness can be conquered by rising up, and false argu-
ments can be conquered by factual ascertainment. Talkativeness can be
avoided by gravity and silence, and by prowess one can avoid fearfulness.
Perfect knowledge can be obtained by self-cultivation. One must be freed
from lust, avarice, anger, dreaming, etc., to attain actually the path of
salvation.

As far as the women class are concerned, they are accepted as a power
of inspiration for man. As such, women are more powerful than men.
Mighty Julius Caesar was controlled by a Cleopatra. Such powerful women
are controlled by shyness. Therefore, shyness is important for women.
Once this control valve is loosened, women can create havoc in society by
adultery. Adultery means production of unwanted children known as
varna-saitkara, who disturb the world.

The last item was taught by Bhismadeva. This is the process of pleasing
the Lord. We are all eternal servants of the Lord, and when we forget this
essential part of our nature we are put into material conditions of life. The
simple process of pleasing the Lord (for the householders especially) is to
install the Deity of the Lord at home. By concentrating on the Deity. one
may progressively go on with the daily routine work. Worshiping the Deity
at home, serving the devotee, hearing the Srimad-Bhagavatam, residing in a
holy place and chanting the holy name of the Lord are all inexpensive
items by which one can please the Lord. Thus the subject matter was
explained by the grandfather to his grandchildren.

PURPORT
Incidences mentioned in the Vedic literatures, such as the Puranas,
Mahabharata and Ramayana, etc., are factual historical narrations which
took place sometime in the past, although net in any chronological order.
Such historical facts, being instructive for ordinary men, were assorted
without chronological reference. Besides that, they happen on different
planets, nay, in different universes, and thus the description of the narrations
is sometimes measured by three dimensions. We are simply concerned
with the instructive lessons of such incidences, even though they are not
in order by our limited range of understanding. Bhismadeva described such
narrations before Maharaja Yudhisthira in reply to his different questions.

Text 30] Bhisma’s Passing Away 477
TRANSLATION
While Bhismadeva was describing occupational duties, the sun’s course
ran into the northern hemisphere. This period is desired by mystics who
die at their will.
PURPORT
The perfect yogis or mystics can leave the material body at their own
sweet will at a suitable time and go to a suitable planet desired by them.
In the Bhagavad-gita (Bg. 8.14) it is said that self-realized souls who have
exactly identified themselves with the interest of the Supreme Lord can
generally leave the material body during the time of the fire-god’s efful-
gence and when the sun is in the northern horizon, and thus achieve the
transcendental sky. In the Vedas these times are considered auspicious for
quitting the body, and they are taken advantage of by the expert mystics
who have perfected the system. Perfection of yoga means attainment of
such supermental states as to be able to leave the material body as desired.
They can 3150 reach any planet within no time without a material vehicle.
The yogis can reach the highest planetary system within a very short time,
and this is impossible for the materialist. Even attempting to reach the
highest planet will take millions of years at a speed of millions of miles per
hour. This is a different science, and Bhismadeva knew well how to utilize
it. He was just waiting for the suitable moment to quit his material body,
and the golden opportunity arrived when he was instructing his noble
grandsons, the Pandavas. He thus prepared himself to quit his body before
the exalted Lord Sri Krsna, the pious Pandavas and the great sages headed
by Bhagavan Vyasa, etc., all great souls.

Thereupon that man who spoke on different subjects with thousands of
meanings and who fought on thousands of battlefields and protected
thousands of men, stopped speaking, and being completely freed from all
bondage, withdrew his mind from everything else and fixed his wide-open
eyes upon the Personality of Godhead Sri Krsna who stood before him,
four-handed, dressed in yellow garments that glitiered and shined.
PURPORT

In the momentous hour of leaving this material body the glorious
example set by Bhismadeva is the important function of the human form
of life. The subject matter which attracts the dying man becomes the
beginning of his next life. If, therefore, one is absorbed in the thoughts of
the Supreme Lord Sri Krsna, he is sure to go back to Godhead without any
doubt. This is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita (Bg. 8.5-15):

5: And whoever, at the time of death, quits his body, remembering Me
alone, at once attains My nature. Of this there is no doubt.

6: Whatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body, that
state he will attain without fail.

7: Therefore, Arjuna, you should always think of Me in the form of
Krsna and at the same time carry out vour prescribed duty of fighting.
With your activities dedicated to Me and your mind and intelligence fixed
or Me, vou will attain Me without doubt.

8: He who meditates on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his mind
constantly engaged in remembering Me, undeviated from the path, he, O
Partha [ Arjuna], is sure to reach Me.

9: One should meditate upon the Supreme Person as the one who knows
everything, as He who is the oldest, who is the controller, who is smaller
than the smallest, who is the maintainer of everything, who is beyond all
material conception, who is inconceivable, and who is always a person. He
is luminous like the sun and, being transcendental, is beyond this material
nature.


--- Page 104 ---

10: One who. at the time of death. fixes his life air between the eve-
brows and in full devotion engages himself in remembering the Supreme
Lord. will certainly attain to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

11: Persons learned in the Fedas. who utter omkara and who are great

one practices celibacy. 1 shall now explain to vou this process by which
one may attain salvation.

12: The yogic situation is that of detachment from all sensual engage-
ments. Clesing all the doors of the senses and fixing the mind on the heart
and the life air at the top of the head. one establishes himself in yoga.

13: After being situated in this voga practice and vibrating the sacred
syllable om, the supreme combination of letters, if one thinks of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead and quits his body. he will certainly
reach the spiritual planets.

14: For one who remembers Me without deviation, I am easy to obtain.
O son of Prtha, because of his constant engagement in devotional service.

15: After attaining Me, the great souls, who are yogis in devotion, never
return to this temporary world, which is full of miseries, because they
have attained the highest perfection.

Sri Bhismadeva attained the perfection of quitting his body at will and
was fortunate enough to have Lord Krsna, the object of his attention,
personally present at the time of death. He, therefore, fixed his open eves
upon Him. He wanted to see Sri Krsna for a long time out of his sponta-
neous love for Him. Because he was a pure devotee. he had very little to
do with the detailed performance of vogic principles. Simple bhakti-yoga
is enough to bring about perfection. Therefore. the ardent desire of
Bhismadeva was to see the person of Lord Krsna, the most lovable object.
and by the grace of the Lord, Sri Bhismadeva had this opportunity at the
last stage of his breathing.

TRANSLATION
By pure meditation, looking at Lord Sri Krsna, he at once was freed
from all material inauspiciousness and was relieved of all bodily pains
caused by the arrow wounds. Thus all the external activities of his senses
were at once stopped, and he prayed transcendentally to the controller of
all living beings while quitting his material body.
PURPORT
The material body is a gift of the material energy technically called
illusion. Identification with the material body is due to forgetfulness of
our eternal relationship with the Lord. For a pure devotee of the Lord like
Bhismadeva, this illusion was at once removed as soon as the Lord arrived.
Lord Krsna is like the sun, and the illusory external material energy is like
darkness. In the presence of the sun there is no possibility of darkness
standing. Therefore. just on the arrival of Lord Krsna, all material con-
tamination was completely removed. and Bhismadeva was thus able to be
transcendentally situated by stopping the activities of the impure senses
in collaboration with matter. The soul is originally pure and so also the
senses. By material contamination the senses assume the role of imper-
fection and impurity. By revival of contact with the Supreme Pure Lord
Krsna the senses again become freed from material contaminations.
Bhismadeva attained all these transcendental conditions prior to his leaving
the material body because of the presence of the Lord. The Lord is the
controller and benefactor of all living beings. That is the verdict of all
Vedas. He is the supreme eternity and living entity amongst all the eternal
living beings. = And He alone provides all necessities for alt Kinds of living
beings. Thus He provided all facilities to fulfill the transcendental desires

unto the all-powerful Lord Sri Krsna. He is always self-satisfied, but
sometimes, being the leader of the devotees, He enjoys transcendental
pleasure by descending on the material world, although from Him only the
material world is created.
PURPORT
Because Bhismadeva was a statesman, the head of the Kuru dynasty. a
great general and a leader of ksatrivas, his mind was strewn over so niany
subjects. and his thinking. feeling and willing were engaged 111 different
matters. Now. in order to achieve pure devotional service. he wants to


--- Page 107 ---
482 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 9
invest all powers of thinking, feeling and willing entirely in the Supreme
Being Lord Krsna. He is described herein as the leader of the devotees and
all-powerful. Although Lord Krsna is the original Personality of Godhead,
He Himself descends on earth to bestow upon His pure devotees the boon
of devotional service. He descends sometimes as Lord Krsna as He is. and
sometimes as Lord Cailanya. Both are leaders of the pure devotees. Pure
devotees of the Lord have no desire other than the service of the Lord, and
therefore they are called satvata. The Lord is the chief amongst such
satvatas. Bhismadeva. therefore, has no other desires. Unless one is purified
from all sorts of material desires, the Lord does not become one’s leader.
Desires cannot be wiped out, but they have only to be purified. It is
confirmed in the Bhaguvad-gita by the Lord Himself that He gives His
instruction from within the heart of a pure devotee who is constantly
engaged in the service of the Lord (Bg. 7.28). Such instruction is given not
for any material purpose but only for going back home. back to Godhead
(Bg. 10.10). For the ordinary man who wants to lord it over material
nature. the Lord only sanctions and becomes a witness of activities, but
He never gives the nondevotee instructions for going back to Godhead.
That is the difference in dealings by the Lord to different living beings,
both the devotee and the nondevotee. He is leader of all the living beings,
as the King of the state rules both the prisoners and the free citizens. But
His dealings are different in terms of devotee and nondevotee. Non-
devotees never care lo take any instruction from the Lord. and therefore
the Lord is silent in their case, although He witnesses all their activities
and awards them the necessary results, good or bad. The devotees are above
this material goodness and badness, but they are progressive on the path of
transcendence, and therefore they have no desire for anything material.
The devotee also knows Sri Krsna as the original Narayana because Lord
Sri Krsna, by His plenary portion, appears.as the Kiranodakagayi Visnu,
the original source of all material creation. The Lord also desires the
association of His pure devotees, and for them only the Lord descends on
the earth and enlivens them. The Lord appears out of His own will. He is
not forced by the conditions of material nature. Ie is therefore described
here as the vibhu. or the Almighty. for He is never conditioned by the
laws of material nature.

TRANSLATION
Sri Krsna is the intimate friend of Arjuna. He has appeared on this
earth in His transcendental body which resembles the bluish color of the
tamidla tree. His body attracts everyone in the three [upper, middle and
lower] planetary systems. May His glittering yellow dress and His lotus
face, covered with paintings of sandalwood pulp, be the object of my
attraction, and may I not desire fruitive results.
PURPORT
When Sri Krsna by His own internal pleasure appears on earth, He does
so by the agency of His internal potency. The attractive features of His
transcendental body are desired in all the three worlds, namely the upper,
middle and lower planetary systems. Nowhere in the universe are there
such beautiful bodily features as those of Lord Krsna. Therefore His
transcendental body has nothing to do with anything materially created.
Arjuna is described here as the conquerer, and Krsna is described as his
intimate friend. Bhismadeva on his bed of arrows after the Battle of
Kuruksetra is remembering the particular dress of Lord Krsna which He
put on as the driver of Arjuna’s chariot. While fighting was going on be-
tween Arjuna and Bhisma, Bhisma’s attraction was drawn by the glittering
dress of Krsna, and indirectly he admired his so-called enemy Arjuna for
possessing the Lord as his friend. Arjuna was always a conquerer because


--- Page 109 ---
484 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 9
the Lord was his friend. Bhismadeva takes this opportunity to address the
Lord as vijayasakhe (friend of Arjuna)because the Lord is pleased when He
is addressed conjointly with His devotees who are related with Him in
different transcendental humors. While Krsna was the charioteer of Arjuna,
sun rays glittered on the dress of the Lord, and the beautiful hue created
by the reflection of such rays was never forgotten by Bhismadeva. As a
great fighter he was relishing the relation of Krsna in the chivalrous humor.
Transcendental relation with the Lord in any one of the different rasas
(humors) is relishable by the respective devotees in the highest ecstasy.
Less intelligent mundaners who want to make a show of being transcen-
dentally related with the Lord artificially jump at once to the relation of
conjugal love, imitating the damsels of Vrajadhama. Such a cheap relation
with the Lord exhibits only the base mentality of the mundaner because
one who has relished conjugal humor with the Lord cannot be attached to
worldly conjugal rasa, which is condemned even by mundane ethics. The
eternal relation of a particular soul with the Lord is evolved. A genuine
relation of the living being with the Supreme Lord can take any form out
of the five principal rasas, and it does not make any difference in transcen-
dental degree to the genuine devotee. Bhismadeva is a concrete example of
this, and it should be carefully observed how the great general is transcen-
dentally related with the Lord.

TRANSLATION
On the battlefield [where Sri Krgna attended Arjuna out of friendship],
the flowing hair of Lord Krsna turned ashen due to the dust raised by the
hoofs of the horses. And because of His labor, beads of sweat wetted His
face. All these decorations, intensified by the wounds dealt by my sharp
arrows, were enjoyed by Him. Let my mind thus go unto Sri Krsna.
PURPORT

The Lord is the absolute form of eternity, bliss and knowledge. As such,
transcendental loving service of the Lord in one of the five principal
relations, namely, Santa, dasya, sakhya, vatsalya and madhurya, i.e.,
neutrality, servitorship, fraternity, filial affection and conjugal love, is
graciously 5 by the Lord when offered to the Lord in genuine love
and affection. Sri Bhismadeva is a great devotee of the Lord in the relation
of servitorship. Thus his throwing of sharp arrows at the transcendental
body of the Lord is as good as the worship of another devotee who throws
soft roses upon Him.

It appears that Bhismadeva is repenting his actions, which he committed
against the person of the Lord. But factually the Lord’s body was not at all
pained due to His transcendental existence. His body is not matter. Both
He Himself and His body are complete spiritual identity. Spirit is never
pierced, burnt, dried, moistened, etc. This is vividly explained in the
Bhagavad-gita. So also it is stated in-the Skanda Purana. It is said there
that spirit is always uncontamtnated and indestructible. It cannot be
distressed, nor can it be dried up. When Lord Visnu in His incarnation
appears before us, He seems to be like one of the conditioned souls
materially encaged just to bewilder the asuras, or the nonbelievers, who are
always alert to kill the Lord, even from the very beginning of His appear-
ance. Kamsa wanted to kill Krsna, and Ravana wanted to kill Rama, be-
cause foolishly they were unaware of the fact that the Lord is never killed,
for the spirit is never annihilated.

Therefore Bhismadeva’s piercing of the body of Lord Krsna is a sort of
bewildering problem for the nondevotee atheist, but those who are devo-
tees or those who are liberated souls are not bewildered.


--- Page 111 ---
486 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 9

Bhigmadeva appreciated the all- merciful attitude of the Lord because He
did not leave Arjuna alone, although He was disturbed by the sharpened
arrows of Bhigmadeva, nor was He reluctant to come before Bhigma’s
deathbed, even though He was ill-treated by him in the battlefield.
Bhisma’s repentance and the Lord’s merciful attitude are both unique in
this picture.

SH Viévanatha Cakravarti Thakur, a great dcarya and devotee in the
humor of conjugal love with the Lord, remarks very saliently in this
regard. He says that the wounds created on the body of the Lord by the
sharpened arrows of Bhismadeva were as pleasing to the Lord as the
biting of a fiancee who bites the body of the Lord directed by a strong
sense of sex desire. Such biting by the opposite sex is never taken as a
sign of enmity, even if there is a wound on the body. Therefore, the
fighting as an exchange of transcendental pleasure between the Lord and
His pure devotee, SH Bhismadeva, was not at all mundane. Besides that,
since the Lord's body and the Lord are identical, there was no possibility
of wounds in the absolute body. The apparent wounds caused by the
sharpened arrows are misleading to the common man. but one who has a
little absolute knowledge can understand the transcendental exchange in
the chivalrous relation. The Lord was perfectly happy with the wounds
caused by the sharpened arrows of Bhigmadeva. The word vibhidyamana is
significant because the Lord's skin is not different from the Lord. Because
our skin is different from our soul. in our case the word vibhidyamana, or
being bruised and cut. would have been quite suitable. Transcendental
bliss is of different varieties, and the variety of activities in the mundane
world is but a perverted reflection of transcendental bliss. Because every-
thing in the mundane world 15 equalitatively mundane, it is full of ine-
brieties, whereas in the absolute realm, because everything is of the same
absolute nature, there are varieties of enjovment without inebriety. The
Lord enjoyed the wounds created by His great devotee Bhismadeva, and
because Bhismadeva is a devotee in the chivalrous relation, he fixes up his
mind on Krsna in that wounded condition.

TRANSLATION
In obedience to the command of His friend, Lord Sri Krsna entered the
arena of the Battlefield of Kuruksetra between the soldiers of Arjuna and
Duryodhana, and while there, He shortened the life spans of the opposite
party by His merciful glance. This was done simply by His looking at the
enemy. Let my mind be fixed upon that Krsna.
PURPORT
In the Bhagavad-gita (Bg. 1.21-25) Arjuna ordered the infallible Lord SA
Krsna to place his chariot between the phalanxes of the soldiers. He asked
Him to stay there until he had finished observing the enemies he had to face
in the batile. When the Lord was so asked, He at once did so just like an
order carrier. And the Lord pointed out all the important men on the
opposite side, saying, “Here is Bhisma, here is Drona,” and so on. The
Lord, being the supreme living being, is never the order supplier or order
carrier of anyone, whoever may he be. But out of His causeless mercy and
affection for His pure devotees, sometimes He carries out the order of the
devotee like an awaiting servant. By executing the order of a devotee, the
Lord becomes pleased, as a father is pleased to carry out the order of his
small child. This is possible only out of pure transcendental love between
the Lord and His devotees, and Bhismadeva is quite aware of this fact.
He, therefore, addressed the Lord as the friend of Arjuna.
The Lord diminished the duration of life of the opposite party by His
merciful glance. It is said that all fighters who assembled on the Battlefield
of Kuruksetra attained salvation by personally seeing the Lord at the time


--- Page 113 ---
488 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 9
of death. Therefore, His diminishing the duration of life of the enemy of
Arjuna does not mean that He was partial to the cause of Arjuna. Factually
He was merciful to the opposite party because they would not have
attained salvation by dying at home in the ordinary course of life. Here
was a chance to see the Lord at the time of death and thus attain salvation
from material life. Therefore, the Lord is all good, and whatever He does
is for everyone’s good. Apparently it was for the victory of Arjuna, His
intimate friend, but factually it was for the good of Arjuna’s enemies. Such
are the transcendental activities of the Lord, and whoever understands
this also gets salvation after quitting this material body. The Lord does
no wrong in any circumstance because He is absolute, all good at all times.

Text 37] Bhisma’s Passing Away 489

PURPORT
The kings and the commanders were to stand in the front of the fighting
soldiers. That was the system of actual fighting. The kings and commanders
were not so-called presidents or ministers of defense as they are today.
They would not stay home while the poor soldiers or mercenaries were
fighting face to face. This may be the regulation of modern democracy,
but when actual monarchy was prevailing, the monarchs were not cowards
elected without consideration of qualification. As it was evident from the
Battlefield of Kuruksetra, all the executive heads like Drona, Bhisma,
Arjuna, Duryodhana, etc., of both parties, were not sleeping, but all of
them were actual participants in the fighting which was selected to be
executed at a place away from the civil residential quarters. This means
that the innocent citizens were immuned from all effects of fighting
between the rival royal parties. The citizens had no business to see what
was going to happen after such fighting. They were to pay one fourth of
their income to the ruler, whether he be Arjuna or Duryodhana. All the
commanders of the parties on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra were standing
face to face, and Arjuna saw them with great compassion and lamented
that he was to kill his kinsmen on the battlefield for the sake of the
empire. He was not at all afraid of the giant military phalanx presented by
Duryodhana. but as a merciful devotee of the Lord. renunciation of worldly
things was natural for him, and thus he decided not to fight for worldly
possessions. But this was due to a poor fund of knowledge, and therefore
it is said here that his intelligence became polluted. His intelligence could
not be polluted at any time because he was a devotee and constant
companion of the Lord, as is clear in the Fourth Chapter of the Bhagavad-
gita. Apparently Arjuna’s intelligence became polluted because otherwise
there would not have been a chance to deliver the teachings of Bhagavad-
gita for the good of all polluted conditioned souls engaged in material
bondage by the conception of the false material body. The Bhegavad-gita
was delivered to the conditioned souls of the world to deliver them from
the wrong conception of identifying the body with the soul and to reestab-
lish the souls eternal relation with the Supreme Lord. Atma-vidya, or
transcendental knowledge of Himself, was primarily spoken by the Lord

for the benefit of all concerned in all parts of the universe.

Fulfilling my desire and sacrificing His own promise, He got down

like a lion goes to kill an elephant. He even dropped His outer garment
on the way.
PURPORT
The Battle of Kuruksetra was fought on military principles but at the
same time in a sporting spirit, like a friend fights with another friend.
Duryodhana criticized Bhismadeva, alleging that he was reluctant to kill
Arjuna because of paternal affection. A ksatriya cannot tolerate insults on
the principle of fighting. Bhismadeva therefore promised that the next
day he would kill all five Pandavas with special weapons made for the
purpose. Duryodhana was satisfied, and he kept the arrows with him to be
delivered the next day during the fight. By tricks Arjuna took the arrows
from Duryodhana, and Bhismadeva could understand that this was the
trick of Lord Krsna. So he took a vow that the next day Krsna would have
to take up weapons Himself, otherwise His friend Arjuna would die. So in
the next day’s fighting Bhismadeva fought so violently that both Arjuna
and Krsna were in trouble. Arjuna was almost defeated; the situation was
so tense that he was about to be killed by Bhismadeva the very next
moment. At that time Lord Krsna wanted to please His devotee, Bhisma,
by keeping his promise, which was more important than His own. Seeming-
ly He broke His own promise. He promised before the beginning of the


--- Page 116 ---
Text 38] Bhisma’s Passing Away 491
Battle of Kuruksetra that He would remain without weapons and would
not use His strength for either of the parties. But to protect Arjuna He got
down from the chariot, took up the wheel of the chariot and hurriedly
rushed at Bhismadeva in an angry mood, like a lion goes to kill an elephant.
He dropped His covering cloth on the way, and out of great anger He did
not know that He dropped it. Bhismadeva at once gave up his weapons and
stood to be Killed by Krsna, his beloved Lord. The fighting of the day was
thus ended at that very moment, and Arjuna was saved. Of course there
was no possibility of Arjuna’s death because the Lord Himself was on the
chariot, but because Bhismadeva wanted to see Lord Krsna take up some
weapon to save His friend, the Lord created this situation, making Arjuna’s
death imminent. He stood before Bhismadeva to show him that his promise
was fulfilled and that He had taken up the wheel.

--- Page 117 ---
492 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 9
PURPORT

The dealings of Lord Krsna and Bhismadeva on the Battlefield of Kuru-
ksetra are interesting because the activities of Lord Sri Krsna appeared to
be partial to Arjuna and at enmity with Bhismadeva; but factually all this
was especially meant to show special favor to Bhismadeva, a great devotee
of the Lord. The astounding feature of such dealings is that a devotee can
please the Lord by playing the part of an enemy. The Lord, being absolute,
can accept service from His pure devotee even in the garb of an enemy.
The Supreme Lord cannot have any enemy, nor can a so-called enemy
harm Him because He is ajita, or unconquerable. But still He takes
pleasure when His pure devotee beats Him like an enemy or rebukes Him
from a superior position, although no one can be superior to the Lord.
These are some of the transcendental reciprocatory dealings of the devotee
with the Lord. And those who have no information of pure devotional
service cannot penetrate into the mystery of such dealings. Bhismadeva
played the part of a valiant warrior, and he purposely pierced the body of
the Lord so that to the common eyes it appeared that the Lord was
wounded, but factually all this was to bewilder the nondevotees. The all-
spiritual body cannot be wounded, and a devotee cannot become the
enemy of the Lord. Had it been so, then Bhismadeva would not have
desired to have the very same Lord as the ultimate destination of his life.
Had Bhismadeva been an enemy of the Lord, He could have annihilated
him without even moving. There was no need to come before Bhismadeva
with blood and wounds. But He did so because the warrior devotee wanted
to see the transcendental beauty of the Lord decorated with wounds
created by a pure devotee. This is the way of exchanging transcendental
rasas, or relations between the Lord and the servitor. By such dealings
both the Lord and the devotee become glorified in their respective
positions. The Lord was so angry that Arjuna checked Him when He was
moving towards Bhismadeva, but in spite of Arjuna’s checking, He pro-
ceeded towards Bhismadeva as a lover goes to a lover, without caring for
hindrances. Apparently His determination was to kill Bhismadeva, but
factually it was to please him as a great devotee of the Lord. The Lord is
undoubtedly the deliverer of all conditioned souls. The impersonalists
desire salvation from Him, and He always awards them according to their
aspiration, but here Bhismadeva aspires to see the Lord in His personal
feature. All pure devotees aspire for this.

TRANSLATION
At the moment of death, let my ultimate attraction be to Sri Krsna,
the Personality of Godhead. I concentrate my mind upon the chariot driver
of Arjuna who stood with a whip in His right hand and a bridle rope in
His left, who was very careful to give protection to Arjuna’s chariot by all
means. Those who saw Him on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra attained their
original forms after death.
PURPORT
A pure devotee of the Lord constantly sees the presence of the Lord
within himself because of being transcendentally related by loving service.
Such a pure devotee cannot forget the Lord for a moment. This is called
trance. The mystic (yogi) tries to concentrate upon the Supersoul by
controlling the senses from all other engagements, and thus he ultimately
attains samadhi. A devotee more easily attains samadhi or trance by
constantly remembering the Lord’s personal feature along with His holy


--- Page 119 ---
494 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 9
name, fame, pastimes, etc. Therefore, the concentration of the mystic
yogi and that of the devotee are not on the same level. The concentration
of the mystic is something mechanical, whereas that of the pure devotee
is natural in pure love and spontaneous affection. Bhismadeva was a pure
devotee, and as a military marshal he constantly remembered the battle-
field feature of the Lord as Partha-sarathi, the chariot driver of Arjuna.
Therefore, the Lord's pastime as Partha-sarathi is also eternal. All the
pastimes of the Lord, beginning from His birth at the prison house of
Kamsa up to the Mausale-lila at the end, all move one after another in all
the universes, just as the clock hand moves from one point to another.
And in such pastimes His associates like the Pandavas and Bhisma are
constant eternal companions. So Bhismadeva never forgot the beautiful
feature of the Lord as Partha-sarathi, which even Arjuna could not see.
Arjuna was behind the beautiful Partha-sarathi while Bhismadeva was just
in front of the Lord. As far as the military feature of the Lord is concerned,
Bhismadeva observed this with more relish than Arjuna.

All the soldiers and persons on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra attained
their original spiritual form like the Lord after their death because by the
causeless mercy of the Lord they were all able to see Him face to face on
that occasion. The conditioned souls rotating in the evolutionary cycle
from the aquatics up to the form of Brahma are all in the form of maya,
or the form obtained by one’s own actions and awarded by material
nature. The material forms of the conditioned souls are all foreign dresses,
and when the conditioned soul becomes liberated from the clutches of
material energy, he attains his originai form. The impersonalist wants to
attain the impersonal Brahman effulgence of the Lord, but that is not at
all congenial to the living sparks, parts and parcels of the Lord. Therefore,
the impersonalists again fall down and get material forms, which are all
false to the spirit soul. A spiritual form like the Lord’s, either two-handed
or four-handed, 15 attained by the devotees of the Lord either in the
Vaikunthas or in the Goloka planets, according to the original nature of
the soul. This form, which is cent percent spiritual, is the svaripa of the
living being, and all the living beings who participated on the Battlefield of
Kuruksetra, on both sides, attained their svariipa, as confirmed by Bhisma-
deva. So Lord Sr Krsna was not only merciful to the Pandavas, but He
was also merciful to the other parties because all of them attained the same
result. Bhismadeva wanted the same facility also, and that was his prayer
to the Lord, although his position as an associate of the Lord is assured in
all circumstances. The conclusion is that whoever dies looking on the


--- Page 120 ---
Text 40] Bhisma’s Passing Away 495
Personality of Godhead within or without attains his svariipa, which is the
highest perfection of life.

Let my mind be fixed upon Lord Sri Krsna, whose motions and

PURPORT
By intense ecstasy of loving service, the damsels of Vrajabhiimi attained
the qualitative oneness with the Lord by dancing with Him on an equal
level, embracing Him in nuptial love, smiling at Him in joke, and looking
at {im with a loving attitude. The relation of the Lord with Arjuna is
undoubtedly praiseworthy by devotees like Bhismadeva, but the relation
of the gopis with the Lord is stili more praiseworthy because of their still
more purified loving service. By the grace of the Lord, Arjuna was fortunate


--- Page 121 ---
496 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 9
enough to have the fraternal service of the Lord as chariot driver, but the
Lord did not award Arjuna with equal strength. The gopis, however,
practically became one with the Lord by attainment of equal footing with
the Lord. Bhisma’s aspiration to remember the gopis is to pray to have
their mercy also at the last stage of his life. The Lord is satisfied more
when His pure devotees are glorified, and therefore Bhismadeva has not
only glorified the acts of Arjuna, his immediate object of attraction, but
also he has remembered the gopis who were endowed with unrivalled
opportunities by rendering loving service to the Lord. The gopis’ equality
with the Lord should never be misunderstood to be like the sayujya
liberation of the impersonalist. The equality is one of perfect ecstasy
where the differential conception is completely eradicated, for the inte-
rests of the lover and the beloved become identical.

Text 41] Bhisma’s Passing Away 497
during my presence, and I remembered the incident in order to keep my
mind upon the Lord.

PURPORT

After gaining victory in the Battle of Kuruksetra, Maharaja Yudhisthira,
the Emperor of the world, performed the Rajastiya sacrificial ceremony.
The emperor, in those days, upon his ascendence to the throne, would
send a challenge horse all over the world to declare his supremacy, and
any ruling prince or king was at liberty to accept the challenge and
express his tacit willingness either to obey or to disobey the supremacy of
the particular emperor. One who accepts the challenge has to fight with
the emperor and establish his own supremacy by victory. The defeated
challenger would have to sacrifice his life, making a place for another king
or ruler. So Maharaja Yudhisthira also dispatched such challenging horses
all over the world, and every ruling prince and king all over the world
accepted Maharaja Yudhisthira’s leadership as the Emperor of the world.
After this, all rulers of the world under the regime of Maharaja Yudhisthira
were invited to participate in the great sacrificial ceremony of Rajasiiya.
Such performances required hundreds of millions of dollars, and it was
not an easy job for a petty king. Such a sacrificial ceremony, being too
expensive and also difficult to perform under present circumstances, is now
impossible in this age of Kali. Nor can anyone secure the required expert
priesthood to take charge of the ceremony.

So, after being invited, all the kings and great learned sages of the world
assembled in the capital of Mahardja Yudhisthira. The learned society,
including the great philosophers, religionists, physicians, scientists and all
great sages, was invited. That is to say, the brahmanas and the ksatriyas
were the topmost leading men in society, and they were all invited to
participate in the assembly. The waisyas and sudras were unimportant
elements in society, and they are not mentioned herein. Due to the change
of social activities in the modern age, the importance of men has also
changed in terms of occupational positions.

So in that great assembly, Lord इत Krsna was cynosure of the neighbor-
ing eyes. Everyone wanted to see Lord Krsna, and everyone wanted to
pay his humble respects to the Lord. Bhismadeva remembered all this and
was glad that his worshipful Lord, the Personality of Godhead, was present
before him in His actual formal presence. So to meditate on the Supreme
Lord is to meditate on the activities, form, pastime, name and fame of the
Lord. That is easier than what is imagined as meditation on the impersonal


--- Page 123 ---
498 Srimad-Bhagavatam |Canto 1, Ch. 9
feature of the Supreme. In the Bhaguvad-gita it is clearly stated (Bg. 12.5)
that to meditate upon the impersonal feature of the Supreme is very
difficult. it is practically no meditation or simply a waste of time because
very seldom is the desired result obtained. The devotees, however, medi-
tate upon the Lord's factual form and pastimes, and therefore the Lord is
easily approachable by the devotees. This is also stated in the Bhagavad-
gita (Bg. 12.9). The Lord is nondifferent from His transcendental activities.
It is indicated also in this §loka that Lord Sri Krsna, while actually present
before the human society, especially in connection with the Battle of
Kuruksetra, was accepted as the greatest Personality of the time, although
He might not have been recognized as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
The propaganda that a very great man is worshiped as God after his death
is misleading because a man after his death cannot be made into God. Nor
can the Personality of Godhead be a human being, even when He is
personally present. Both ideas are misconceptions. The idea of anthropo-
morphism cannot be applicable in the case of Lord Krsna.

Now I can 1neditate upon that one Lord SriKrsna now present before

ceptions of duality in regard to His presence in everyone's heart, even in
the hearts of the mental speculators. He is in everyone’s heart. The sun
may be perceived differently, but the sun is one.

PURPORT

Lord Sri Krsna is the one Absolute Supreme Personality of Godhead,
but He has expanded Himself into His multiplenary portions by His
inconceivable energy. The conception of duality is due to ignorance of His
inconceivable energy. In the Bhagavad-gita the Lord says (Bg. 9.11) that
only the foolish take Him to he a mere human being. Such foolish men are
not aware of His inconceivable energies. By 1118 inconceivable energy He
is present in everyone's heart, as the sun 15 present before everyone all over
the world. The Paramatma feature of the Lord is an expansion of His
plenary portions. He expands Himself as Paramatma in every one’s heart by
His inconceivable energy, and 116 also expands Himself as the glowing
effulgence of brahmajvoti by expansion of His personal glow. It is stated
in the Brahma-sambhita that the brahmajyoti is His personal glow. There-
fore, there is no difference between Him and His personal glow brahmajyoti
or His plenary portions as Paramatma. Less intelligent persons who are
not aware of this fact consider brahmajvoti and Paramatma to be different
from Sri Krsna. This misconception of duality is completely removed from
the mind of Bhismadeva, and he is now satisfied that it is Lord <न Krsna
only who is all in all in everything. This enlightenment is attained by the
great mahatmas or devolees, as it is stated in the Bhagavad-gita (Bg. 7.19)
that Vasudeva is all in all in everything, and there is no existence of any-
thing without Vasudeva. Vasudeva or Lord Sri Krsna is the original Su-
preme Person, as now confirmed by a mahajana, and therefore both the
neophytes and the pure devotees must try to follow in his footsteps. That
is the way of the devotional line.

The worshipable object of Bhismadeva is Lord Sri Krgpa as Partha-
sarathi, and that of the gopis is the same Krsna in Vrndavana as the most
attractive Syamasundara. Sometimes less intelligent scholars make a mis-
take and think that the Krsna of Vrndavana and that of the Battle of
Kuruksetra are different personalities. But for Bhismadeva this miscon-


--- Page 125 ---
500 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 9
ception is completely removed. Even the impersonalist’s object of destina-
tion is Krsna as the impersonal jyoti, and the yogi’s destination of Param-
atma is also Krsna. Krsna is both brahmajyoti and localized Paramatma,butin
brahmajyoti or Paramatma there is no Krsna or sweet relations with Krsna.
In His personal feature Krsna is both Partha-sarathi and Syamasundara of
Vrndavana, but in His impersonal feature He is neither in the brahmajyoti
nor in the Paramatma. Great mahatmas like Bhismadeva realize all these
different features of Lord Sri Krsna, and therefore they worship Lord
Krsna, knowing Him as the origin of all features.

Suta Gosvami said: Thus Bhismadeva merged himself in the Supersoul
Lord Sri Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, with his mind,

stopped.
PURPORT
The stage attained by Bhismadeva while quitting His material body is
called nirvikalpa-samadhi because he merged his self inte thinking of the
Lord and his mind into remembering His different activities. He chanted


--- Page 126 ---
Text 44] Bhisma’s Passing Away 501
the glories of the Lord, and by His sight he began to see the Lord person-
ally present before him, and thus all his activities became concentrated
upon the Lord without deviation. This is the highest stage of perfection,
and it is possible for everyone to attain this stage by practice of devo-
tional service. The devotional service of the Lord consists of nine princi-
ples of service activities, and they are 1) hearing, 2) chanting. 3) remem-
bering. 4) serving the lotus feet, 5) worshiping, 6) praying, 7) executing
the orders, 8) fraternizing, and 9) fully surrendering. Any one of them or
all of them are equally competent to award the desired result, but they
require to be practiced persistently under the guidance of an expert
devotee of the Lord. The first item, hearing. is the most important item
of all, and therefore hearing of the Bhagavad-gita and. later on. Srimad-
Bhagavatam is essential for the serious candidate who wants to attain the
stage of Bhismadeva at the end. The unique situation at Bhismadeva’s
time of death can be attained, even though Lord Krsna may not be person-
ally present. His words of the Bhagavad-gita or those of Srimad-Bhagavatam
are identical with the Lord. They are sound incarnations of the Lord, and
one can fully utilize them to be entitled to attain the stage of Sri Bhisma-
deva, who was one of the eight Vasus. Every man or animal must die at a
certain stage of life, but one who dies like Bhismadeva attains perfection,
and one who dies forced by the laws of nature dies like an animal. That is
the difference between a man and an animal, and the human form of life
is especially meant for dying like Bhismadeva.

TRANSLATION
Knowing that Bhismadeva had merged into the unlimited eternity of
the Supreme Absolute, all present there became silent like birds at the
end of the day.
PURPORT
To enter into or to become merged into the unlimited eternity of the
Supreme Absolute means to enter the original home of the living being.
The living beings are all component parts and parcels of the Absolute
Personality of Godhead, and therefore they are eternally related with Him
as Lhe servitor and the served. The Lord is served by all His parts and
parcels, as the complete machine is served by its parts and parcels. Any
part of the machine removed from the whole is no longer important.
Similarly, any part and parcel of the Absolute detached from the service
of the Lord is useless. The living beings who are in the material world are
all disintegrated parts and parcels of the supreme whole, and they are no
longer as important as the original parts and parcels. There are. however.
more integrated living ‘beings who are eternally liberated. The material
energy of the Lord, called Durga-gakti, or the superintendent of the prison
house, takes charge of the disintegrated parts and parcels, and thus they
undergo a conditioned life under the laws of material nature. When the
living being becomes conscious of this fact, he tries to go back home,
back to Godhead, and thus the spiritual urge of the living being begins.
This spiritual urge is called Brahma-jijiasa, or inquiry about Brahman.
Principally this Brahma-jijiasa is successful by knowledge, renunciation
and devotional service of the Lord. Jaane, or knowledge, means to know
everything of Brahman, the Supreme. renunciation means detachment of
material affection, and devotional service is the revival by practice of the
original position of the living being. The successful living beings who are
eligibie to enter into the realm of the Absolute are called the jaanis, the
yogis and the bhaktas. The jidanis and yegis enter into the impersonal rays
of the Supreme. but the bhaktas enter into the spiritual planets known as
the Vaikunthas. In these spiritual planets the Supreme lord as Narayana
predominates, and the healthy unconditioned living beings live there by
rendering loving service to the Lord in the capacity of servant, friend,
parents and fiancee. There the unconditioned living beings enjoy life in
full freedom with the Lord, whereas the impersonalist (76175 and yogis
enter into the impersonal glowing effulgence of the Vaikuntha planets.


--- Page 128 ---
Text 45] Bhisma’s Passing Away 503
The Vaikuntha planets are all self-illuminating like the sun, and the rays of
the Vaikuntha planets are called the brahmajyoti. The brahmajyoti is
spread unlimitedly, and the material world is but a covered portion of an
insignificant part of the same brahmajyoti. This covering is temporary, and
therefore it is a sort of illusion.

Bhismadeva, as a pure devotee of the Lord, entered the spiritual realm
in one of the Vaikuntha planets where the Lord in His eternal form of
Partha-sarathi predominates over the unconditioned living beings who are
constantly engaged in the service of the Lord. The love and affection
which bind the Lord and devotee are exhibited in the case of Bhismadeva.
Bhismadeva never forgot the Lord in His transcendental feature as the
Partha-sarathi, and the Lord was present personally before Bhismadeva
while he was passing to the transcendental world. That is the highest per-
fection of life.

Thereafter, both men and demigods sounded drums in honor, and the

Bhismadeva was respected both by the human beings and the demigods.
The human beings live on earth and similar other planets in the प्रा and
Bhuvar group of planets, but the demigods live in the Svar or heavenly

planets, and all of them knew Bhismadeva as a great warrior and devotee of
the Lord. As a mahdjana (or authority) he was on the level of Brahma,
Narada and Siva, although he was a human being. Qualification on a par
with the great demigods is possible only on attainment of spiritual per-
fection. Thus Bhismadeva was known all over the universes, and during his
time interplanetary travel was effected by finer methods than the futile
endeavors of mechanical spacecraft. When the distant planets were in-
formed of the passing away of Bhismadeva, all the inhabitants of the
upper planets as well as of the earth dropped showers of flowers to show
due respect to the departed great personality. This showering of flowers
from heaven is a sign of recognition by great demigods, and it should
never be compared to the decoration of the dead body. The body of
Bhismadeva lost its material effects due to being surcharged with spiritual
realization, and thus the body was spiritualized as when iron becomes
red-hot when in contact with fire. The body of a fully self-realized
soul is not, therefore, accepted as material. Special ceremonies are
observed for such spiritual bodies. The respect and recognition of Bhisma-
deva are never to be imitated by artificial means, as it has become a fashion
to observe the so-called jayanti ceremony for any and every common man.
According to authorized $astras, such a jayanti ceremony for an ordinary
man, however exalted he may be materially, is an offense to the Lord
because jayanti is reserved for the day when the Lord appears on the
earth. Bhismadeva was unique in his activities, and his passing away to the
kingdom of God is also unique.

TRANSLATION
0 descendant of Bhrgu [Saunaka], after performing funeral rituals
for the dead body of Bhismadeva, Maharaja Yudhisthira was momentarily
overtaken with grief.
PURPORT
Bhismadeva was not only a great family head of Maharaja Yudhisthira,
but also he was a great philosopher and friend of him, his brothers and his
mother. Since Maharaja Pandu, the father of the five brothers headed by
Maharaja Yudhisthira, died, Bhismadeva was the most affectionate grand-
father of the Pandavas and caretaker of the widow daughter-in-law
Kuntidevi. Although Maharaja Dhrtarastra, the elder uncle of Maharaja
Yudhisthira, was there to look after them, his affection was more on the
side of his hundred sons, headed by Duryodhana. Ultimately a colossal
clique was fabricated to deprive the five fatherless brothers of the rightful
claim of the kingdom of Hastinapura. There was great intrigue, common in
imperial palaces, and the five brothers were exiled into the wilderness. But
Bhismadeva was always a sincerely sympathetic well-wisher, grandfather,
friend and philosopher to Maharaja Yudhisthira, even up to the last moment
of his life. He died very happily by seeing Maharaja Yudhisthira to the
throne, otherwise he would have long ago quitted his material body,
instead of suffering agony over the undue sufferings of the Pandavas. He
was simply waiting for the opportune moment because he was sure and
certain that the sons of Pandu would come out victorious in the Battlefield
of Kuruksetra, as His Lordship Sri Krsna was their protector. As a devotee
of the Lord, he knew that the Lord’s devotee cannot be vanquished at
any rate. Maharaja Yudhisthira was quite aware of all these good wishes
of Bhismadeva, and therefore he must have been feeling the great separa-
tion. He was sorry for the separation of a great soul, and not for the mate-
rial body which Bhismadeva relinquished. The funeral ceremony was a
necessary duty, although Bhismadeva was a liberated soul. Since Bhisma-
deva was without issue, the eldest grandson, namely Maharaja Yudhisthira,
was the rightful person to perform this ceremony. It was a great boon to
Bhismadeva that an equally great son of the family undertook the last
rites of a great man.

TRANSLATION
All the great sages then glorified the Lord Sri Krsna, who was present
there, by confidential Vedic hymns. Then all of them returned to their
respective hermitages, bearing always Lord Krsna within their hearts.
PURPORT
The devotees of the Lord are always in the heart of the Lord, and the
Lord is always in the heart of the devotees. That is the sweet relation
between the Lord and His devotees. Due to unalloyed love and devotion
for the Lord, the devotees always see Him within themselves, and the
Lord also, although He has nothing to do and nothing to aspire to, is always
busy in attending to the welfare of His devotees. For the ordinary living
beings the law of nature is there for all actions and reactions, but He is
always anxious to put His devotees on the right path. The devotees are,
therefore, under the direct care of the Lord. And the Lord also volun-
tarily puts Himself under the care of His devotees only. So all the sages,
headed by Vyasadeva, were devotees of the Lord, and therefore they
chanted the Vedic hymns after the funeral ceremony just to please the
Lord, who was present there personally. All the Vedic hymns are chanted
to please Lord Krsna. This is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita (Bg. 15.15).
All the Vedas, Upanisads, Vedanta, etc., are seeking Him only, and ail
hymns are for glorifying Him only. The sages, therefore, performed the
exact acts suitable for the purpose, and they happily departed for their
respective hermitages.

TRANSLATION
Thereafter, Maharaja Yudhisthira at once went to his capital, Hastina-
pura, accompanied by Lord Sri Krsna, and there he consoled his uncle and
aunt Gandhari, who was an ascetic.
PURPORT

Dhrtarastra and Gandhari, the father and the mother of Duryodhana
and his brothers, were the elder uncle and aunt of Maharaja Yudhisthira.
After the Battle of Kuruksetra, the celebrated couple, having lost all their
sons and grandsons, were under the care of Maharaja Yudhisthira. They
were passing their days in great agony over such heavy loss of life and were
practically living the life of ascetics. The death news of Bhismadeva, uncle
of Dhrtarastra, was another great shock for the King and the Queen, and
therefore they required solace from Maharaja Yudhisthira. Maharaja
Yudhisthira was conscious of his duty, and he at once hurried to the spot
with Lord Krsna and satisfied the begrieved Dhrtarastra with kind words,
both from himself and the Lord also.

Gandhari was a powerful ascetic, although she was living the life of a
faithful wife and a kind mother. It is said that 03110113817 also voluntarily
closed her eyes because of the blindness of her husband. A wife’s duty is
to follow the husband cent percent. And Gandhar1 was so true to her
husband that she followed him even in his perpetual blindness. Therefore


--- Page 133 ---
508 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 9
in her actions she was a great ascetic. Besides that, the shock which she
suffered because of the wholesale killing of her one hundred sons and
her grandsons also was certainly too much for a woman. But she
suffered all this just like an ascetic. 03110171317, although a woman, is no
less than Bhismadeva in character. They are both remarkable personalities
in the Mahabharata.

TRANSLATION
After this, the great religious King, Maharaja Yudhisthira, executed the
royal power in the kingdom strictly according to the codes and royal
principles which were approved by his uncle and confirmed by Lord Sri
Krsna.
PURPORT
Maharaja Yudhisthira was not a mere tax collector. He was always con-
scious of his duty as a king, which is no less than that of a father or
spiritual master. The King is to see to the welfare of the citizens from all
angles of social, political, economic and spiritual upliftment. The king
must know that human life is meant for liberating the encaged soul from
the bondage of material conditions, and therefore his duty is to see that
the citizens are properly looked after to attain this highest stage of per-
fection.


--- Page 134 ---
Text 49] Bhisma’s Passing Away 509

Maharaja Yudhisthira followed these principles strictly, as it will be
seen from the next chapter. Not only did he follow the principles, but he
also got approval from his old uncle who was experienced in political
affairs, and that was also confirmed by Lord Krsna, the speaker of the
philosophy of Bhagavad-gita.

Maharaja Yudhisthira is the ideal monarch, and monarchy under a
trained king like Maharaja Yudhisthira is by far the most superior form of
government, superior to modern republics or governments of the people,
by the people. The mass of people, especially in this age of Kali, are all
born sudras, basically low-born, ill-trained, unfortunate and badly
associated. Therefore, they themselves do not know the highest perfection-
al aim of life. Therefore, votes cast by them actually have no value, and
thus persons elected by such irresponsible votes cannot be responsible
representatives like Maharaja Yudhisthira.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the First Canto, Ninth Chapter,
of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “The Passing Away of 1911 [51778006100 in
the Presence of Lord Krsna.”

PURPORT
Maharaja Yudhisthira was the greatest of all men of religion. Thus he
was not at all inclined to fight with his cousins for the sake of enjoying
the kingdom: he fought for the right cause because the kingdom of
Hastinapura was his rightful inheritance, and his cousins wanted to usurp
it for themselves. He fought. therefore, for the right cause under the guid-
ance of Lord Sri Krsna, but he could not enjoy the results of his victory
because his cousins were all Killed in the fight. He therefore ruled over the
kingdom as a matter of duty, assisted by his younger brothers. The inquiry
was important for Saunaka Rsi, who wanted to know about the after
behavior of Maharaja Yudhisthira when he was at ease to enjoy the
kingdom.

ing Maharaja Yudhisthira in his own kingdom and after restoring the
Kuru dynasty, which had been exhausted by the bamboo fire of anger.
PURPORT
This world is compared with a fire in the forest caused by the cohesion
of bamboo bughes. Such a forest fire takes place automatically. for bamboo
cohesion occurs without external cause. Similarly, in the material world
the wrath of those who want to lord it over material nature interacts, and
the fire of war takes place, exhausting the unwanted population. Such
fires or wars take place, and the Lord has nothing to do with them. But
because He wants to maintain the creation, He desires the mass of people
to follow the right path of self-realization, which enables the living beings
to enter into the kingdom of God. The Lord wants the suffering human
beings to come back home, back to Himself, and cease to suffer the
threefold material pangs. The whole plan of creation is made in that way,
and one who does not come to his senses suffers in the material world by
pangs inflicted by the illusory energy of the Lord. The Lord therefore
wants His bona fide representative to rule the world. Lord Sri Krsna
descended to establish this sort of regime and to kill the unwanted persons
who have nothing to do with His plan. The Battle of Kuruksetra was
fought according to the plan of the Lord so that undesirable persons could
get out of the world and a peaceful kingdom under His devotee could be
established. The Lord was therefore fully satisfied when King Yudhisthira
was on the throne and the seedling of the dynasty of Kuru, in the person
of Maharaja Pariksit, was saved.

TRANSLATION

Maharaja Yudhisthira, after being enlightened by what was spoken by
Bhismadeva and Lord Sri Krsna, the infallible, engaged himself in matters
of perfect knowledge because all his misgivings were eradicated. Thus he
ruled over the earth and seas and was followed by his younger brothers.

PURPORT

The modern English law of primogeniture. or the law of inheritance by
the first-born, was also prevalent in those days when Maharaja Yudhisthira
ruled the earth and seas. In those days the King of Hastinapura (now part
of New Delhi) was the emperor of the world, including the seas, up to the
time of Maharaja Pariksit, the grandson of Maharaja Yudhisthira. His
younger brothers were acting as his ministers and commanders of state,
and there was full cooperation between the perfectly religious brothers of
the king. Mahardja Yudhisthira was the ideal king or representative of
Lord इपर Krsna to rule over the kingdom of earth and was comparable to
King Indra, the representative ruler of the heavenly planet. The demigods
like Indra, Candra, Siirya, Varuna, Vayu, etc., are representative kings of
different planets of the universe, and similarly Maharaja Yudhisthira was
also one of them, ruling over the kingdom of the earth. Maharaja
Yudhisthira was not a typically unenlightened political leader of modern
democracy. Maharaja Yudhisthira was instructed by Bhismadeva and the
infallible Lord also, and therefore he had full knowledge of everything in
perfection.

The modern elected executive head of a state is just like a puppet
because he has no kingly power. Even if he is enlightened like Maharaja
Yudhisthira, he cannot do anything out of his own good will due to his
constitutional position. Therefore, there are so many states over the earth
quarreling because of ideological differences or other selfish motives. But
a king like Maharaja Yudhisthira had no ideology of his own. He had but
to follow the instructions of the infallible Lord and the Lord’s representa-
tive and the authorized agent, Bhismadeva. It is instructed in the sastras


--- Page 139 ---
Text 4] Departure of Lord Krsna for Dvaraka 515
that one should follow the great authority and the infallible Lord without
any personal motive and manufactured ideology. Therefore, it was possible
for Maharaja Yudhisthira to rule the whole world, including the seas,
because the principles were infaliible and universally applicable to every-
one. The conception of one world state can only be fulfilled if we can
follow the infallible authority. An imperfect human being cannot create
an ideology acceptable to everyone. Only the perfect and the infallible can
create a program which is applicable at every place and can be followed hy
all in the world. It is the person who rules, and not the impersonal govern-
ment. If the person is perfect, the government is perfect. If the person is
a fool, the government is a fool’s paradise. That is the law of nature. There
are so many stories of imperfect kings or executive heads. Therefore, the
executive head must be a trained person like Maharaja Yudhisthira, and he
must have the full autocratic power to rule over the world. The conception
of a world state can take shape only under the regime of a perfect king
like Maharaja Yudhisthira. The world was happy in those days because
there were kings like Maharaja Yudhisthira to rule over the world.

TRANSLATION
During the reign of Maharaja Yudhisthira, the clouds showered all the

water that people needed, and the earth produced all the necessities of
man in profusion. Due to its fatty milk bag and cheerful attitude, the cow
used to moisten the grazing ground with milk.


--- Page 140 ---
516 Srimad-Bhagavatam |Canto 1, Ch. 10
PURPORT

The basic principle of economic development is centered about land
and cows. The necessities of human society are food grains, fruits, milk,
minerals, clothing, wood, etc. One requires all these items to fulfill the
material needs of the body. Certainly one does not require flesh and fish
or iron tools and machinery. During the regime of Maharaja Yudhisthira,
all over the world there were regulated rainfalls. Rainfalls are not in the
control of the human being. The heavenly King Indradeva is the controller
of rains, and he is the servant of the Lord. When the Lord is obeyed by
the king and the people under the king’s administration, there are regu-
lated rains from the horizon, and these rains are the causes of all varieties
of production on the land. Regulated rains not only help ample production
of grains and fruits, but when they combine with astronomical influences
there is ample production of valuable stones and pearls. Grains and
vegetables can sumptuously feed a man and animals, and a fatty cow
delivers enough milk to supply a man sumptuously with vigor and vitality.
If there is enough milk, enough grains, enough fruit, enough cotton,
enough silk and enough jewels, then why do the people need cinemas,
houses of prostitution, slaughterhouses, etc.? What is the need of an arti-
ficial luxurious life of cinema, cars, radio, flesh and hotels? Has this
civilization produced anything but quarreling individually and nationally?
Has this civilization enhanced the cause of equality and fraternity by
sending thousands of men into a hellish factory and the war fields at the
whims of a particular man?

It is said here that the cows used to moisten the pasturing land with
milk because their milk bags were fatty and the animals were joyful. Do
they not require, therefore, proper protection for a joyful life by being fed
with sufficient quantity of grass in the field? Why should men kill cows
for their selfish purposes? Why should man not be satisfied with grains.
fruits and milk, which, combined together, can produce hundreds and
thousands of palatable dishes. Why are there slaughterhouses all over the
world to kill innocent animals? Maharaja Pariksit, grandson of Maharaja
Yudhisthira, while touring his vast kingdom, saw a black man attempting
to kill a cow. The King at once arrested the butcher and chastised him
sufficiently. Should not a king or an executive head protect the lives of the
poor animals who are unable to defend themselves? Is this humanity? Are
not the animals of a country citizens also? Then why are they allowed to
be butchered in organized slaughterhouses? Are these signs of equality
and fraternity or nonviolence?


--- Page 141 ---
Text 5] Departure of Lord Krsna for Dvaraka 517

Therefore, in contrast with the modern advanced civilized form of
government, an autocracy like Maharaja Yudhisthira’s is by far superior
to so-called democracy in which animals are killed and a man less than an
animal is allowed to cast votes for another less-than-animal man.

We are all creatures of material nature. In the Bhagavad-gita it is said
that the Lord Himself is the seed-giving father and material nature is the
mother of all living beings in all shapes. Thus mother material nature has
enough foodstuff Loth for animals and men, by the grace of the Father
Almighty Sri Krsna. The human being is the elder brother of all other living
beings. He is endowed with intelligence more powerful than animals for
realizing the course of nature and the indications of the Almighty Father.
Human civilizations should depend on the production of material nature
without artificially attempting economic development to turn the world
into a chaos of artificial greed and power only for the purpose of artificial
luxuries and sense gratification. This is but the life of dogs and hogs.

TRANSLATION
The rivers, oceans, hills, mountains, forests, creepers and active drugs,
in every season, paid their tax quota to the King in profusion.
PURPORT

Since Maharaja Yudhisthira was under the protection of the ajita, the

infallible Lord, as above mentioned, the property of the Lord, namely the


--- Page 142 ---
518 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 10
rivers, oceans, hills, forests, etc., were all pleased, and they used to supply
their respective quota of taxation to the King. The secret to success is to
take refuge under the protection of the Supreme Lord. Without His
sanction, nothing can be possible. To make economic development by our
own endeavors on the strength of tools and machinery is not all. The
sanction of the Supreme Lord must be there, otherwise despite all instru-
mental arrangements everything will be unsuccessful. The ultimate cause
of success is the daiva or the Supreme. Kings like Maharaja Yudhisthira
knew perfectly well that the king is the agent of the Supreme Lord tolook
after the welfare of the mass of people. Actually the state belongs to the
Supreme Lord. The rivers, the oceans, the forests, the hills, drugs, etc., are
not creations of man. They are all creations of the Supreme Lord, and the
living being is allowed to make use of the property of the Lord for
service of the Lord. Today’s slogan is that everything is for the people, and
therefore the government is for the people and by the people. But to
produce a new species of humanity at the present moment on the basis of
philosophy and religion, on the basis of justice and peace, on the basis of
God consciousness and perfection of human life, the ideology of godly
communism, the world has again to follow in the footsteps of kings like
Maharaja Yudhisthira or Pariksit. There is enough of everything by the will
of the Lord, and we can make proper use of things to live comfortably
without any enmity between men, or animal and man or nature. Every-
where the control of the Lord is there, and if the Lord is pleased, every
part of nature will be pleased. The river will flow profusely to fertilize the
land, the oceans will supply sufficient quantity of minerals, pearls and
jewels, the forest will supply sufficient wood, drugs and vegetables, and
the seasonal changes will effectively help produce fruits and flowers in
profuse quantity. The artificial way of living depending on factories and
tools can render so-called happiness only to a limited number at the cost
of millions. Since the energy of the mass of people is engaged in factory
production, the naturai products are being hampered, and for this the
mass is unhappy. Without being educated properly, the mass of people are
following in the footsteps of the vested interest by exploiting natural
reserve, and therefore there is acute competition between individual and
individual and nation and nation. There is no control by the trained agent
of the Lord. We must look into the defects of modern civilization by
comparison here, and should follow in the footsteps of Maharaja
Yudhisthira to cleanse man and wipe out anachronisms.

TRANSLATION
Due to the King’s having no enemy, the living beings were not at any
time disturbed by mental agonies, diseases, or excessive heat or cold.
PURPORT
To be nonviolent to human beings and to be a killer or enemy of the
poor animals is Satan’s philosophy. In this age there is enmity against poor
animals, and therefore the poor creatures are always anxious. The reaction
of the poor animals is being forced en human society, and therefore there
is always the strain of cold or hot war between men, individually, collec-
tively or nationally. At the time of Maharaja Yudhisthira, there were no
different nations, although there were different subordinate states. The
whole world was united, and the supreme head, being a trained king like
Yudhisthira, kept all the inhabitants free from anxiety, diseases and
excessive heat and cold. They were not only economically well-to-do, but
also they were physically fit and undisturbed by supernatural power, by
cnmity of other living beings and by disturbance of bodily and mental
agonies. There is a proverb in Bengali that a bad king spoils the kingdom
and a bad housewife spoils the family. This truth is applicable here also.
Because the King was pious, obedient to the Lord and sages, because he


--- Page 144 ---
520 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 10
was no one’s enemy and because he was a recognized agent of the Lord
and therefore protected by Him, all the citizens under the King’s protec-
tion. were, so to speak, directly protected by the Lord and His authorized
agents. Unless one is pious and recognized by the Lord, he cannot make
others happy who are under his care. There is full cooperation between
man and God and man and nature, and this conscious cooperation be-
tween man and God and man and nature, as exemplified by King
Yudhisthira, can bring about happiness, peace and prosperity in the world.
The attitude of exploiting one another, the custom of the day, will only
bring misery.

Kuruksetra and Yudhisthira’s being enthroned, but to oblige the request
of Maharaja Yudhisthira and to show special mercy to Bhismadeva, Lord
Krsna stopped at Hastinapura, the capital of the Pandavas. The Lord
decided to stay especially to pacify the aggrieved King as well as to please
Subhadra, sister of Lord Sri Krsna. Subhadrid was especially pacified
because she lost her only son Abhimanyu, who was just married. The
boy left his wife, Uttara, mother of Maharaja Pariksit. The Lord is

Afterwards, when the Lord asked permission to depart and the King
gave it, the Lord offered His respects to Maharaja Yudhisthira by bow-
ing down at his feet, and the King embraced Him. After this the Lord,
being embraced by others and receiving their obeisances, got into His
chariot.
PURPORT
Maharaja Yudhisthira was the elder cousin of Lord Krsna, and therefore
while departing from him the Lord bowed down at the King’s feet and
the King embraced Him as a younger brother, although the King knew
perfectly well that Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The
Lord takes pleasure when some of His devotees accept Him as less impor-
tant in terms of love. No one is greater than nor equal to the Lord, but He
takes pleasure in being treated as younger than His devotees. These are all
transcendental pastimes of the Lord. The impersonalist cannot enter into
the supernatural roles played by the devotee of the Lord. Thereafter
Bhima and Arjuna embraced the Lord because they were of the same age,
but Nakula and Sahadeva bowed down before the Lord because they were
younger than Him.

from Lord Krsna.
PURPORT
Lord Sri Krsna is so attractive for the living beings, especially for the
devotees, that it is impossible for them to tolerate separation. The condi-
tioned soul under the spell of illusory energy forgets the Lord, otherwise
he cannot. The feeling of such separation cannot be described, but it can
simply be imagined by devotees only. After His separation from Vrndavana
from the innocent rural cowherd boys, girls, ladies and others, they all felt
shock throughout their lives, and the separation of Radharani, the most

beloved cowherd girl, is beyond expression. Once they met at Kuruksetra
during a solar eclipse, and the feeling which was expressed by them is
heartrending. There is, of course, a difference in the qualities of the
transcendental devotees of the Lord, but none of them who have ever
contacted the Lord by direct communion or otherwise can leave Him for a
moment. That is the attitude of the pure devotee.

separation, for they had been intimately associated with His person,
seeing Him eye to eye, touching Him, conversing with Him, and sleeping,
sitting and dining with Him?


--- Page 148 ---
524 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 10
PURPORT

The living being’s constitutional position is one of serving a superior. He
is obliged to serve by force the dictates of illusory material energy in 01
ferent phases of sense gratification. And in serving the senses he is never
tired. Even though he may be tired, the illusory energy forces him to do so
without being satisfied perpetually. There is no end of such sense gratifi-
catory business. and the conditioned soul becomes entangled in such
servitude without any hope of release. The release is only effected by
association of pure devotees. By such association one is gradually pro-
moted to his transcendental consciousness. Thus he can know that his
eternal position is to render service unto the Lord and not to the perverted
senses in the capacity of lust. anger, desire to lord it over, etc. The
material society. friendship and love all are different phases of lust. Home,
country, family, society, wealth and all sorts of corollaries are all causes
of bondage in the material world where the threefold miseries of life are
concomitant factors. By associating with pure devotees and by hearing
them submissively, attachment for material enjoyment becomes slackened,
and attraction for hearing about the transcendental activities of the Lord
becomes prominent. Once they are, they will go on progressively without
stoppage. like fire in gunpowder. It is said that Hari, the Personality
of Godhead, is so transcendentally attractive that even those who are
self-satisfied by self-realization and are factually liberated from all material
bondage also become devotees of the Lord. Under the circumstances it is
easily understood what must have been the position of the Pandavas, who
were constant companions of the Lord. They could not even think of sepa-
ration from इते Krsna because the attraction was more intense for them be-
cause of continuous personal contact. His remembrance by His form, quali-
ty, name, fame, pastimes, etc., is also attractive for the pure devotee, so
much so that he forgets all forms, quality, name, fame and activities of the
mundane world, and due to his mature association with pure devotees he is
not out of contact with the Lord for a moment.

TRANSLATION
All their hearts were melting for Him on the pot of attraction. They

PURPORT
Krsna is naturally attractive for all living beings because He is the chief
eternal amongst all eternals. He alone is the maintainer of the many eter-
nals. This is stated in the Kathopanisad Veda, and thus one can obtain
permanent peace and prosperity by revival of one’s eternal relation with
Him, now forgotten under the spell of maya or the illusory energy of the
Lord. Once this relation is slightly revived, the conditioned soul at once
becomes freed from the illusion of material energy and becomes mad after
the association of the Lord. This association is made possible not only in
personal contact with the Lord. but also by association of His name, fame,
form and quality, and Srimad-Bhagavatam trains the conditioned soul to
this stage of perfection by submissive hearing from the pure devotee.

TRANSLATION
The female relatives, whose eyes were flooded with tears out of anxiety
for Krsna, came out of the palace. They could only stop their tears with
great difficulty. They feared that tears would cause misfortune at the time
of departure.
PURPORT

There were hundreds of ladies in the palace of Hastinapura. All of them
were affectionate to Krsna. All of them were relatives also. When they saw
that Krsna was going away from the palace for His native place, they were
very anxious for Him, and as usual tears began to roll down their cheeks.
They thought, at the same time, that tears at that moment might be a
cause of misfortune for Krsna; therefore they wanted to check them. It
was very difficult for them because they could not be checked. Therefore,
they smeared their tears in their eyes, and their hearts throbbed. Therefore
ladies who were the wives and daughters-in-law of those who died in the
battlefield never came in direct contact with Krsna. But all of them heard
of Him and His great activities, and thus they thought of Him, talked of
Him, His name, fame, etc., and thus they became affectionate also like
those who were in direct contact. Therefore directly or indirectly anyone
who thinks of Krsna, talks of Krsna or worships Krsna becomes attached
to Him. Because Krsna is absolute, there is no difference between His
name, form, quality, etc. Our intimate relation with Krsna can be confi-
dentially revived by talking of, hearing of, or remembering Him. It is so
done due to spiritual potency.

TRANSLATION
Out of a loving desire to see the Lord, the royal ladies of the Kurus got
up on top of the palace, and smiling with affection and shyness, they
showered flowers upon the Lord.
PURPORT
Shyness is a particular extra-natural beauty of the fair sex, and it
commands respect from the opposite sex. This custom was observed even
during the days of the Mahabharata, i.e., more than five thousand years
ago. It is only the less intelligent persons who are not well versed in the
history of the world who say that observance of separation of female from


--- Page 152 ---
528 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 10
male is an introduction of the Mohammedan period in India. This inci-
dence from the Mahabharata period proves definitely that the ladies of the
palace observed strict purdah (restricted association with men), and instead
of coming down in the open air where Lord Krsna and others were
assembled, the ladies of the palace went up on the top of the palace and
from there paid their respects to Lord Krsna by showers of flowers. It is
definitely stated here that the ladies were smiling there on the top of the
palace, checked by shyness. This shyness is a gift of nature to the fair sex,
and it enhances their beauty and prestige, even if they are of a less impor-
tant family or even if they are less attractive. We have practical experience
of this fact. A sweeper woman commanded the respect of many respectable
gentlemen simply by manifesting a lady’s shyness. Half-naked ladies in the
street do not command any respect, but a shy sweeper’s wife commands
respect from all.

Human civilization, as conceived by the sages of India, is to help one
free himself from the clutches of illusion. The material beauty of a woman
is an illusion because actually the body is made of earth, water, fire, air,
ete. But because there is the association of the living spark with matter,
it appears to be beautiful. No one is attracted by an earthen doll, even if it
is most perfectly prepared to attract the attention of others. The dead
body has no beauty because no one will accept the dead body of a so-
called beautiful woman. Therefore, the conclusion is that the spirit spark is
beautiful, and because of the soul’s beauty one is attracted by the beauty
of the outward body. The Vedic wisdom, therefore, forbids us to be at-
tracted by false beauty. But because we are now in the darkness of
ignorance, the Vedic civilization allows very restricted mixing of woman
and man. They say that the woman is considered to be the fire, and the
man is considered to be the butter. The butter must melt in association
with fire, and therefore they may be brought together only when it is
necessary. And shyness is a check to the unrestricted mixing. It is nature’s
gift, and it must be utilized.

TRANSLATION
It was being heard here and there that the benedictions being paid to
Krsna were neither befitting nor unbefitting because they were all for the
Absolute who was now playing the part of a human being.
PURPORT
At places there were sounds of Vedic benediction aiming at the Person-
ality of Godhead इते Krsna. The benedictions were fitting in the sense that
the Lord was playing the part of a human being as if a cousin of Maharaja
Yudhisthira, but they were unfitting also because the Lord is absolute and
has nothing to do with any kind of material relativities. He is nirguna, or
there are no material qualities in Him, but He is full of transcendental
qualities. In the transcendental world there is nothing contradictory,
whereas in the relative world everything has its opposite. In the relative
world white is the opposite conception of black, but in the transcendental
world there is no distinction between whiie and black. Therefore the
sounds of benedictions uttered by the learned brahmanas here and there
appear to be contradictory in relation with the Absolute Person, but when
they are applied to the Absolute Person they lose all contradiction and
become transcendental. One example may clear this idea. Lord Sri Krsna
is sometimes described as a thief. He is very famous amongst His pure
devotees as the Makhan-Cora. He used to steal butter from the houses of
neighbors at Vrndavana in His early age. Since then He is famous as a


--- Page 155 ---
Text 20] Departure of Lord Krsna for Dvaraka 531
thief. But in spite of His being famous as a thief, He is worshiped as a thief,
whereas in the mundane world a thief is punished and is never praised.
Being the Absolute Personality of Godhead, everything is applicable to
Him, and still in spite of all contradictions He is the Supreme Personality
of Godhead.

The ladies on the roofs of all the houses of Hastinapura, who were all
absorbed in the thought of the transcendental qualities of the Lord who is
sung in select poetry, began to talk of Him. This talk was more attractive
than the hymns of the Vedas.
PURPORT
In the Bhagavad-gita it is said that in all the Vedic literatures the goal is
the Personality of Godhead Sri Krsna. Factually the glories of the Lord are
depicted in such literature as the Vedas, Ramayana and Mahabharata. And
in the Bhagavatam they are specifically mentioned in respect to the
Supreme Lord. Therefore, while the ladies on the tops of the houses in the
capital of the kings of the Kuru dynasty were talking about the Lord they
were more pleasing than the Vedic hymns. Anything sung in the praise of
the Lord is Sruti-mantra. There are songs of Thakur Narottama Dasa, one
of the dcaryas in the Gaudiya-sampradaya, composed in simple Bengali


--- Page 156 ---
532 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 10
language. But Thakur Visvanatha Cakravarti, another very learned acarya
of the same sampradaya, has approved the songs by Thakur Narottama
Dasa to be as good as Vedic maniras. And this is so because of the subject
matter. The language is immaterial, but the subject matter is important.
The ladies, who were all absorbed in the thought and actions of the Lord,
developed the consciousness of Vedic wisdom hy the grace of the Lord.
And, therefore. although such ladies might not have been very learned
scholars in Sanskrit or otherwise, still whatever they spoke was more
attractive than the Vedic hymns. The Vedic hymns in the Upanisads are
sometimes indirectly directed to the Supreme Lord. But the talks of the
ladies are directly spoken of the Lord, and thus they were more pleasing
to the heart. The ladies’ talks appeared to be more valuable than the
learned brahmanas’ benedictions.

Text 21] Departure of Lord Krsna for Dvaraka 533
PURPORT

There are two types.of dissolution of the manifestive cosmos. At the
end of every 4,320,000,000 solar years, when Brahma, the lord of one par-
ticular universe, goes to sleep, there is one annihilation. And at the end of
Brahma’s life, which takes place at the end of Brahma’s one hundred years
of age, in our calculation at the end of 8,640,000,000 x 30 x 12 x 100
solar years, there is complete annihilation of the entire universe, and in
both the periods both the material energy called the mahat-tattra and the
marginal energy called jiva-tattva merge in the person of the Supreme
Lord. The living beings remain asleep within the body of the Lord until
there is another creation of the material world, and that is the way of
creation, maintenance and annihilation of the material manifestation.

The material creation is effected by the interaction of the three modes
of material nature set in action by the Lord, and therefore it is said here
that the Lord existed before the modes of material nature were set in
motion. In the Sruti mantra it is said that only Visnu, the Supreme Lord,
existed before the creation, and there were no Brahma or Siva and other
demigods. Visnu means the Maha-Visnu who is lying on the Causal Ocean,
and by His breathing only all the universes arc generating in seeds and
gradually developing into gigantic forms with innumerable planets within
each and every universe. The seeds of universes develop into gigantic forms
in the way seeds of a banyan tree develop into numberless banyan trees.

This Maha-Visnu is the plenary portion of the Lord Sri Krsna, who is
mentioned in the Brahma-sarhita as follows:

“Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto the original Personality of
Godhead, Govinda, whose plenary portion is the Maha-Vispu. All the
Brahmas or the heads of the universes live only for the period of His
exhaling, after the universes are generated from the pores of His transcen-
dental body.” (Brahma-sarihita 5.58).

Thus Govinda, or Lord Krsna, is the cause of Maha-Visnu also. The
ladies talking about this Vedic truth must have heard it from authoritative
sources. An authoritative source is the only means of knowing about
transcendental subject matter definitely. There is no other alternative.

The merging of the living beings into the body of Maha-Visnu takes place
automatically at the end of Brahma’s one hundred years. But that does
not mean that the individual living being loses his identity. The identity is
there, and as soon as there is another creation by the supreme will of the
Lord, all the sleeping or inactive living beings are again let loose to begin
their activities in the continuation of past different spheres of life. It is
called suptotthita naya, or awakening from sleep and again engaging in


--- Page 158 ---
534 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 10
one’s respective continuous duty. When a man is asleep at night, he forgets
himself, what he is, what his duty is and everything of his waking state.
But as soon as he awakens from slumber, he remembers all that he has to
do and thus engages himself again in his prescribed activities. The living
beings also remain merged in the body of Maha-Visnu during the period of
annihilation, but as soon as there is another creation they arise to take
up their unfinished work. This is also confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita
(8.18-20).

The Lord existed before the creative energy was set in action. The Lord
is not a product of the material energy. His body is completely spiritual,
and there is no difference between His body, and Himself. Before creation
the Lord remained in His abode, which is absolute and one.

--- Page 159 ---
Text 22] Departure of Lord Krsna for Dvaraka 535
PURPORT

The living entities are parts and parcels of the Lord. They are of two
varieties, namely the nitya-mukta and nitya-baddha. The nitya-muktas
are eternally liberated souls, and they are eternally engaged in the reciproca-
tion of transcendental loving service with the Lord in His eternal abode
beyond the manifested mundane creations. But the nitya-baddha or
eternally conditioned souls are entrusted to [15 external energy, maya,
for rectification of their rebellious attitude towards the Supreme Father.
Nitya-baddhas are eternally forgetful of their relation with the Lord as
parts and parcels. They are bewildered by the illusory energy as products
of matter, and thus they are very busy in making plans in the material
world for becoming happy. They go on merrily with plans, but by the
will of the Lord both the planmakers and the plans are annihilated at the
end of a certain period, as above mentioned. This is confirmed in the
Bhagavad-gita as follows: “O son of Kunti, when the period of a kalpa
{the duration of the life of Brahma] is ended, all the living entities merge
unto My nature, and again when the time of creation is ripe, I begin
creation by the agency of My external energy.” (Bg. 9.7)

The word bhiiyah indicates again and again, that is to say the process of
creation, maintenance and annihilation is going on perpetually by the
external energy of the Lord. He is the cause of everything. But the living
beings who are constitutionally the parts and parcels of the Lord and are
forgetful of the sweet relation, are given a chance again to get rid of the
clutches of the external energy. And to revive his (the living being’s) con-
sciousness, the revealed scriptures are also created by the Lord. Vedic
literatures are the guiding directions for the conditioned souls so they
can get free from the repetition of creation and annihilation of the
material world and the material body.

The Lord says in the Bhagavad-gita, “This created world and material
energy are under My control. Under the influence of prakrti, automatically
they are created again and again, and this is done by Me through the
agency of My external energy.”

Actually the spiritual spark living entities have no material names or
forms. But in order to fulfill their desire to lord it over the material
energy of material forms and names, they are given a chance for such
false enjoyment, and at the same time they are given a chance to under-
stand the real position through the revealed scriptures. The foolish and


--- Page 160 ---
536 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 10
forgetful living being is always busy with false forms and false names.
Modern nationalism is the culmination of such false names and false forms.
Men are mad after false name and form. The form of body obtained under
certain conditions is taken up as factual, and the name also taken
bewilders the conditioned soul into misusing the energy in the name of so
many “isms.” The scriptures, however, supply the clue of understanding
the real position, but men are reluctant to take lessons from the scriptures
created by the Lord for different places and times. For example, the
Bhagarad-gita is the guiding principle for every human being, but by the
spell of material energy they do not take care to carry out the programs
of life in terms of the Bhagavad-gita. Srimad-Bhagavatam is the post-
graduate study of knowledge for one who has thoroughly understood the
principles of the Bhagavad-gita. Unfortunately they have no taste for
them, and therefore they are under the clutches of maya for repetition of
birth and death.

cleansed of material consciousness by dint of rigid devotional service and
full control of life and the senses. And that is the only way to purify
existence.
PURPORT

As it is stated in the Bhagavad-gita, the Lord can be known in His real
nature by dint of pure devotional service only. So it is stated here that
only the great devotees of the Lord who are able to clear the mind of all
material dusts by rigid devotional service can experience the Lord as He
is. Jitendriya means one who has full control over the senses. The senses
are active parts of the body, and their activities cannot be stopped. The ar-
tificial means of the yogic processes to make the senses inactive has proved
to be abject failure, even in the case of great yogis like Visvamitra Muni.
Vidvamitra Muni controlled the senses by yogic trance, but when he
happened to meet Menaki (a heavenly society woman), he became a
victim of sex, and the artificial way of controlling the senses failed. But in
the case of a-pure devotee, the senses are not at all artificially stopped
from doing anything, but they are given different good engagements. When
the senses are engaged in more attractive activities, there is no chance of
their being attracted by any other inferior engagements. In the Bhagavad-
gita it is said that the senses can only be controlled by better engagements.
Devotional service necessitates purifying the senses or engaging them in
the activities of devotional service. Devotional service is not inaction. Any-
thing done in the service of the Lord becomes at once purified of its
material nature. Material conception is due to ignorance only. There is
nothing beyond Vasudeva. The Vasudeva conception gradually develops
in the heart of the learned after a prolonged acceleration of the receptive
organs. But the process ends in the knowledge of accepting Vasudeva as all
in all. In the case of devotional service, this very same method is accepted
from the very beginning, and by the grace of the Lord all factual
knowledge becomes revealed in the heart of a devotee due to dictation by
the Lord from within. Therefore controlling the senses by devotionalservice
is the only and easiest means.

TRANSLATION
O dear friends, here is that very Personality of Godhead whose
attractive and confidential pastimes are described in the confidential
parts of Vedic literature by His great devotees. It is He only who creates,
maintains and annihilates the material world and yet remains unaffected.
PURPORT
As it is stated in the Bhagavad-gita, all the Vedic literatures are glorifying
the greatness of Lord Sri Krsna. Here it is confirmed in the Bhagavatam
also. The Vedas are expanded by many branches and subbranches by great
devotees and empowered incarnations of the Lord like Vyasa, Narada,
Sukadeva Gosvami, the Kumaras, Kapila, Prahlada, Janaka, Bali, Yamaraja,
etc., but in the Srimad-Bhagavatam especially, the confidential parts of
His activities are described by the confidential devotee Sukadeva Gosvami.
In the Vedanta-sitras or Upanisads there is only hint of the confidential
parts of His pastimes. In such Vedic literatures as the Upanisads, etc.,
the Lord has expressively been distinguished from the mundane concep-
tion of His existence. His identity being fully spiritual, His form, name,
quality, and paraphernalia, etc., have been elaborately distinguished from
matter, and therefore He is sometimes misunderstood by less intelligent
persons as impersonal. But factually He is the Supreme Person, Bhagavan,
and He is partially represented as Paramatma or impersonal Brahman.

TRANSLATION
Whenever there are kings and administrators living like animals in the
lowest modes of existence, the Lord in His transcendental form manifests
His supreme power, the Truth Positive, shows special mercy to the faith-
ful, performs wonderful activities and manifests various transcendental
forms as is necessary in different periods and ages.
PURPORT
As mentioned above, the cosmic creation is the property of the Supreme
Lord. This is the basic philosophy of Isopanisad: everything 15 the property
of the Supreme Being. No one should encroach upon the property of the
Supreme Lord. One should only accept what is kindly awarded by Him.
Therefore, the earth or any other planet or universe is the absolute property
of the Lord. The living beings are certainly His parts and parcels or sons,
and thus every one of them has a right to live at the mercy of the Lord to
execute his prescribed work. No one, therefore, can encroach upon the
right of another individual man or animal without being so sanctioned by
the Lord. The king or the administrator is the representative of the Lord to
look after the management of the Lord’s will. He must therefore be a
recognized person like Maharaja Yudhisthira or Pariksit. Such kings have
full responsibility and knowledge from authorities about the administration
of the world. But at times, due to the influence of the ignorance mode of


--- Page 164 ---
540 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 10
material nature (tamo-guna) or the lowest of the material modes, kings
and administrators come into power without knowledge and responsibility,
and such foolish administrators live like animals for the sake of their own
personal interest. The result is that the whole atmosphere becomes sur-
charged with anarchy and vicious elements. Nepotism, bribery, cheating,
aggression and. therefore. famine, epidemic, war and similar other disturb-
ing features become prominent in human society. And the devotees of the
Lord or the faithfuls are persecuted by all means. All these symptoms
indicate the time of an incarnation of the Lord to reestablish the
principles of religion and to vanquish the maladministrators. This is also
confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita.

The Lord then appears in His transcendental form without any tinge of
material qualities. He descends just to keep the state of His creation in a
normal condition. The normal condition is that the Lord has provided each
and every planet with all the needs of the native living beings. They can
happily live and execute their predestined occupations to attain salvation
at the end, following the rules and regulations mentioned in the revealed
scriptures. The material world is created to satisfy the whims of the
nitya-baddha, or everlasting conditioned souls, just as naughty boys are
provided with playing cradles. Otherwise there was no need of the
material world. But when they become intoxicated with the power of
material science to exploit the resources unlawfully without the sanction
of the Lord. and that also only for sense gratification, there is necessity of
the Lord’s incarnation to chastise the rebellious and to protect the faithful.

When He descends, He exhibits superhuman acts just to prove lis
supreme right, and materialists like Ravana, Hiranyakadipu, Kamsa, etc.,
are sufficiently punished. He acts in a manner which no one can imitate.
For example, the Lord, when He appeared as Rama, bridged the Indian
Ocean. When He appeared as Krsna, from His very childhood He showed
superhuman activities by killing Patana, Aghasura, Sakatasura, Kaliya,
etc., and then His maternal uncle Kamsa. When He was at Dvaraka He
married 16,108 queens, and all of them were blessed with a sufficient
number of children. The sum total of His personal family members
amounted to about 100,000, popularly known as the Yadu-vam$a. And
again, during His lifetime, He managed to vanquish them all. He is famous
as the Govardhanadhari Hari because He lifted at the age of only seven
the hill known as Govardhana. The Lord killed many undesirable kings in
His time, and as ksatriya He fought chivalrously. He is famous as the
asamaurdha, unparalleled. No one is equal to or greater than Him.

quits his body and accepts another body. But His birth is like the appearance

sun is existent in every part of the solar system. but he becomes visible at
a scheduled time and so also becomes invisible at another scheduled time.
Similarly, the Lord appears in this universe like the sun and again leaves

our sight at another time. He exists at all times and at every place, but by
His causeless mercy when He appears before us we take it for granted that
He has taken His birth. Anyone who can understand this truth, in terms of
the statements of revealed scriptures. certainly becomes liberated just after
quitting the present body. Liberation is obtainable after many births and
after great endeavor in patience and perseverance, in knowledge and
renunciation. But simply by knowing in truth about the Lord’s
transcendental births and activities, one can get liberation at once.
That is the verdict of the Bhagavad-gita. But those who are in the
darkness of ignorance conclude that the Lord’s birth and activities
in the material world are similar to those of the ordinary living being.
Such imperfect conclusions cannot give anyone liberation. His birth,
therefore. in the family of King Yadu as the son of King Vasudeva and His
transfer into the family of Nanda Maharaja in the land of Mathura are all
transcendental arrangements made by the internal potency of the Lord.
The fortunes of the Yadu dynasty and that of the inhabitants of the land
of Mathura cannot be materially estimated. If simply by knowing the
transcendental nature of the birth and activities of the Lord one can get
liberation easily, we can just imagine what is in store for those who
actually enjoyed the company of the Lord in person as a family member
or as a neighbor. All those who were fortunate enough to associate with
the Lord, the husband of the goddess of fortune, certainly obtained
something more than what is known as liberation. Therefore, rightly the
dynasty and the land are both ever glorious by the grace of the Lord.

TRANSLATION
Undoubtedly it is wonderful that Dvaraka has defeated the glories of
the heavenly planets and has enhanced the celebrity of the earth. The
inhabitants of Dvaraka are always seeing the soul of all living beings
[Krsna] in His loving feature. He glances at them and favors them with
sweet smiles.
PURPORT
The heavenly planets are inhabited by demigods like Indra, Candra,
Varuna, Vayu, etc., and the pious souls reach there after performance of
many virtuous acts on earth. Modern scientists agree also that the timing
arrangement in higher planetary systems is different from the earth. Thus
it is understood from the revealed scriptures that the duration of life there
is 10,000 years (by our calculation). Six months on earth is equal to one
day on the heavenly planets. Facilities of enjoyment are also similarly
enhanced, and the beauty of the inhabitants is legendary. Common men
on the earth are very much fond of reaching the heavenly planets because
they have heard that comforts of life are far greater there than on the
earth. They are now trying to reach the moon by spacecraft. Considering
all this, the heavenly planets are more celebrated than the earth. But the
celebrity of earth has defeated that of the heavenly planets because of
Dvaraka, where Lord Sri Krsna reigned as King. Three places, namely Vrn-
davana, Mathura and Dvaraka, are more important than the famous planets
within the universe. These places are perpetually sanctified because when-
ever the Lord descends on earth He displays His transcendental activities
particularly in these three places. They are perpetually the holy lands of
the Lord. and the inhabitants still take advantage of the holy places, even
though the Lord is now out of their sight. The Lord is the soul of all living
beings, and He desires always to have all the living beings, in their svaripa,
or in their constitutional position, to participate in transcendental life in
His association. His attractive features and sweet smiles go deep into the
hearts of everyone, and once it is so done the living being is admitted


--- Page 168 ---
544 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 10
in the kingdom of God, from which no one returns. This is confirmed in
the Bhagavad-gita.

The heavenly planets may be very famous for offering better facilities
of material enjoy ment, but as we learn from the Bhagavad-gita (Bg. 9.20-21),
one has to come back again to the earth planet as soon as the acquired
virtue is finished. Dvaraka is certainly more important than the heavenly
planets because whoever has been favored with the smiling glance of the
Lord shall never come back again to this rotten earth, which is certified by
the Lord Himself as a place of misery. Not only this earth but also all the
planets of the universes are places of misery because in none of the
planets within the universe is there eternal life, eternal bliss and eternal
knowledge. Any person engaged in devotional service of the Lord is
recommended to live in one of the above-mentioned three places, namely
Dvaraka, Mathura or Vrndavana. Because devotional service in these three
places is magnified, those who go there to follow the principles in terms
of instructions imparted in the revealed scriptures surely achieve the same
result as obtained during the presence of Lord Sri Krsna. His abode and
He Himself are identical, and a pure devotee under the guidance of another
experienced devotee can obtain all the results, even at present.

TRANSLATION
O friends, just think of His wives whose hands He has accepted. How
they must have undergone vows, baths, fire sacrifice and perfect worship
of the Lord of the universe to constantly relish now the nectar from His
lips [by kissing]. The damsels of Vrajabhiimi would often faint by just
expecting such favors.
PURPORT
Religious rites prescribed in the scriptures are meant to purify the
mundane qualities of the conditioned souls to enable them to become
gradually promoted to the stage of rendering transcendental service unto
the Supreme Lord. Attainment of this stage of pure spiritual life is the
highest perfection, and this stage is called svariipa, or the factual identity
of the living being. Liberation means to renovate this stage of svariipa. In
that perfect stage of svariipa, the living being is established in five phases
of loving service, one of which is the stage of madhurya-rasa, or the
humor of conjugal love. The Lord is always perfect in Himself, and thus
He has no hankering for Himself. He, however, becomes a master, a friend,
a son or a husband to fulfill the intense love of the devotee concerned.
Herein two classes of devotees of the Lord are mentioned in the stage of
conjugal love. One is svakiyd, and the other is parakiya. Both of them are
in conjugal love with the Personality of Godhead Krsna. The queens at
Dvaraka were svakiya, or duly married wives, but the damsels of the Vraja
were young friends of the Lord while He was unmarried. The Lord stayed
at Vrndavana till the age of sixteen, and His friendly relations with the
neighboring girls were in terms of parakiya. These girls, as well as the
queens, underwent severe penances by taking vows, bathing and offering
sacrifice in the fire, as prescribed in the scriptures. The rites, as they are,
are not an end in themselves, nor are fruitive action, culture of knowledge
or perfection in mystic powers ends in themselves. They are all means to
attain to the highest stage of svaripa to render constitutional transcendental
service to the Lord. Each and every living being has his individual position
in either of the above-mentioned five different kinds of reciprocating means
with the Lord, and in one’s pure spiritual form of svaripa the relation


--- Page 170 ---
546 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 10
becomes manifest without mundane affinity. The kissing of the Lord,
either by His wives or His young girl friends who aspired to have the Lord
as their fiance. is not of any mundane perverted quality. Had such things
been mundane, a liberated soul like Sukadeva would not have taken the
trouble to relish them, nor would Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu have
been inclined to participate in those subjects after renouncing worldly life.
The stage is earned after many lives of penance.

by Him after He killed Bhaumasura and thousands of his assistants. All of
them are glorious.
PURPORT
Exceptionally qualified daughters of powerful kings were allowed to
make a choice of their own bridegrooms in open competition, and such
ceremonies were called svayarivara, or selecting the bridegroom. And


--- Page 171 ---
Text 30] Departure of Lord Krsna for Dvaraka 547
because it was open competition between the rival and valiant princes,
such princes were invited by the fathers of the princess, and usually there
were regular fights between the invited princely order in a sporting spirit,
but it so happened that sometimes the belligerent princes were killed in
such marriage-fighting, and the victorious prince was offered the trophy
princess for whom so many princes died. Rukmini, the principal queen of
Lord Krsna, was the daughter of the King of Vidarbha, who wished that
his qualified and beautiful daughter be given away to Lord Krsna. But her
eldest brother wanted her to be given away to King Sigupala, who happened
to be a cousin of Krsna. So there was open competition, and as usual Lord
Krsna emerged successful, after harassing Sisupala and other princes by
His unrivalled prowess. Rukmini had ten sons, like Pradyumna, etc. There
were other queens also taken away by Lord Krsna in a similar way. Full
description of this beautiful booty of Lord Krsna will be given in the
Tenth Canto. There were 16,100 beautiful girls who were daughters of
many kings and were forcibly stolen by Bhaumasura, who kept them
captive for his carnal desire. These girls prayed piteously to Lord Krsna for
their deliverance, and called by their fervent prayer, the merciful Lord
released them all by fighting and killing Bhaumasura. All these captive
princesses were then accepted by the Lord as His wives, although in the
estimation of society they were all fallen girls. The all-powerful Lord
Krsna accepted the humble prayers of these girls and married them with
the adoration of queens. So altogether Lord Krsna had 16,108 queens at
Dvaraka, and in each of them He begot ten children. All these children
grew up, and each had as many children as the father. The aggregate
number of the family numbered 10,000,000.

TRANSLATION

All these women auspiciously glorified their lives despite their being
without individuality and without purity. Their husband, the lotus-eyed
Personality of Godhead, never left them alone at home. He always pleased
their hearts by making valuable presentations.

PURPORT

The devotees of the Lord are purified souls. As soon as the devotees
surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord sincerely, the Lord accepts them,
and thus the devotees at once become free from all material contamina-
tions. Such devotees are above the three modes of material nature. There
is no bodily disqualification of a devotee, just as there is no qualitative
difference between the Ganges water and the unfilthy drain water when
they are amalgamated. Women, merchants and laborers are not very
intelligent, and thus it is very difficult for them to understand the science
of God or to be engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. They are
more materialistic, and less than them are the Kiratas, Hiinas, Andhras,
Pulindas, Pulkasas, Abhira, Kafka, Yavana, Khasadaya, etc., but all of
them can be delivered if they are properly engaged in the devotional
service of the Lord. By engagement in the service of the Lord, the
designative disqualifications are removed, and as pure souls they become
eligible to enter into the kingdom of God.

The fallen girls under the clutches of Bhaumasura sincerely prayed to
Lord Sri Krsna for their deliverance, and their sincerity of purpose made
them at once pure by virtue of devotion. The Lord therefore accepted them
as His wives, and thus their lives became glorified. Such auspicious glorifica-
tion was still more glorified when the Lord played with them as the most
devoted husband.

The Lord used to live with His 16,108 wives constantly. He expanded
Himself into 16.108 plenary portions, and each and every one of them
was the Lord Himself without deviation from the Original Personality.
The Sruti mantra affirms that the Lord can expand Himself into many.
As husband of so many wives, He pleased them all with presentations,

even at a costly endeavor. He brought the parijata plant from heaven
and implanted it at the palace of Satyabhama, one of the principal
queens. If, therefore, anyone desires the Lord to become one’s husband,
the Lord fulfills such desires in full.

TRANSLATION
Maharaja Yudhisthira, although no one’s enemy, engaged four divisions
of defense [horse, elephant, chariot and army] to accompany Lord Krsna,
the enemy of the asuras [demons]. The Maharaja did this because of the
enemy, and also out of affection for the Lord.
PURPORT

Natural defensive measures are horses and elephants combined with
chariots and men. Horses and elephants are trained to move to any part
of the hills or forests or plains. The charioteers could fight with many
horses and elephants by the strength of powerful arrows, even up to the
standard of the brahmastra (similar to modern atomic weapons). Maharaja
Yudhisthira knew well that Krsna is everyone's friend and well-wisher, and
yet there were asuras who were by nature envious of the Lord. So out of
fear of attack from others and out of affection also, he engaged all
varieties of defensive forces as bodyguards of Lord Krsna. If required,
Lord Krsna Himself was sufficient to defend Himself from the attack of
others who counted the Lord as their enemy, but still He accepted all the
arrangements made by Maharaja Yudhisthira because He could not disobey
the King, who was His elder cousin. The Lord plays the part of a sub-
ordinate in His transcendental sporting, and thus sometimes He puts
Himself in the care of Yasodamata for His protection in His so-called
helplessness of childhood. That is the transcendental lila or pastime of
the Lord. The basic principle for all transcendental exchanges between the
Lord and His devotees is exhibited to enjoy a transcendental bliss for
which there is no comparison, even up to the level of brahmananda.

Kuruksetra, Matsya, Sarasvata, the province of the desert and the land of
scanty water. After crossing these provinces He gradually reached the
Sauvira and Abhira provinces, then west of these, reached Dvaraka at last.
PURPORT

The provinces passed over by the Lord in those days were differently
named, but the direction given is sufficient to indicate that He travelled
through Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Saurastra, Gujarat
and at last reached His home province at Dvaraka. We do not gain any
profit simply by researching the analogous provinces of those days up to
now, but it appears that the desert of Rajasthan and the provinces of
scanty water like Madhya Pradesh, etc., were present even five thousand
years ago. The theory of soil experts that the desert developed in recent
years is not supported by the statements of Bhagavatam. We may leave
the matter for expert geologists to research because the changing universe
has different phases of geological development. We are satisfied that the
Lord has now reached His own province, Dvarakadhama, from the Kuru
provinces. Kuruksetra continues to exist since the Vedic age, and it is
sheer foolishness when interpreters ignore or deny the existence of
Kuruksetra.

TRANSLATION
On His journey through these provinces He was welcomed, worshiped
and given various presentations. In the evening, in all places, the Lord
suspended His journey to perform evening rites. This was regularly ob-
served after sunset.
PURPORT

It is said here that the Lord observed the religious principles regularly
while He was on the journey. There are certain philosophical speculations
that even the Lord is under the obligations of fruitive action. But actually
this is not the case. He does not depend on the action of any good or bad
work. Since the Lord is absolute, everything done by Him is good for
everyone. But when He descends on earth, He acts for the protection of
the devotees and for the annihilation of the impious nondevoteces. Al-
though He has no obligatory duty, stil} He does everything so that others
may follow. That is the way of factual teaching: one must act properly
Himself and teach the same to others, otherwise no one will accept such
blind teaching. He is Himself the awarder of fruitive results. He is self-
sufficient, and yet He acts according to the rulings of the revealed scrip-
ture in order to teach us the process. If He does not do so, the common
man may go wrong. But in the advanced stage, when one can understand
the transcendental nature of the Lord, one does not try to imitate Him.
This is not possible.

The Lord in the human society does what is the duty of everyone, but
sometimes He does something which is extraordinary and is not to be
imitated by the living being. His acts of evening prayer as stated herein
must be followed by the living being. but it is not possible to follow His
mountain-lifting or dancing with the gopis. One cannot imitate the sun,
who can exhaust water even from a filthy place: the most powerful can do
something which 15 all-good, but our imitation of such acts will put us into
endless difficulty. Therefore, in all actions, the experienced guide, the
spiritual master, who is the manifested mercy of the Lord. should always
be consulted, and the path of progress will be assured.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the First Canto, Tenth Chapter,
of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “Departure of Lord Krsna for
BDvaraka.”

PURPORT
The beloved Lord was away from His own prosperous metropolis of
Dvaraka for a considerably long period because of the Battle of Kuru-
ksetra, and thus all the inhabitants were overcome with melancholia due to
555

the separation. When the Lord descends on the earth, His eternal associates
also come with Him, just as the entourage of the king accompanies him.
Such associates of the Lord are eternally liberated souls, and they cannot
bear the separation of the Lord even for a moment because of intense
affection for the Lord. Thus the inhabitants of the city of Dvaraka were
in a mood of dejection and expected the arrival of the Lord at any mo-
ment. So the heralding sound of the auspicious conchshell was very en-
couraging. and apparently the sound pacified their dejection. They were
still more aspirant to sce the Lord amongst themselves, and all of them
became alert to receive Him in the befitting manner. These are the signs
of spontaneous love of Godhead.

Text 3] Lord Krsna’s Entrance in Dvaraka 357
PURPORT
Redness of the white conchshell due to the lip-touch of the Lord is a
symbol of spiritual significance. The Lord is all spirit, and matter is
ignorance of this spiritual existence. Factually there is nothing like matter
in the spiritual enlightenment, and this spiritual enlightenment takes place
at once by the contact of the Supreme Lord Sri Krsna. The Lord is pre-
sent in every particle of all existence, and He can manifest His presence in
anyone. By ardent love and devotional service of the Lord, or in other
words by spiritual contact with the Lord, everything becomes spiritually
reddened like the conchshell in the grip of the Lord, and the paramahamsa,
or the supremely intelligent person, plays the part of the ducking swan in
the water of spiritual bliss, eternally decorated by the lotus flower of the
Lord’s feet.

TRANSLATION
The citizens of Dvaraka, having heard that sound which threatens fear
personified in the material world, began to run towards Him fast, just to
have a long desired audience with the Lord, who is the protector of all
devotees.
PURPORT
As already informed, the citizens of Dvaraka who lived at the time of
Lord Krsnpa’s presence there were all liberated souls who descended there
along with the Lord as entourage. All were very anxious to have an audi-


--- Page 181 ---
558 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 11
ence with the Lord, although they were never separated from the Lord by
spiritual contact. Just as the gopis at Vrndavana used to think of Krsna
while He was away from the village for cowherding engagements, so also
the citizens of Dvaraka were all immersed in thought of the Lord while He
was away from Dvaraka to attend the Battle of Kuruksetra. Some dis-
tinguished fiction writer in Bengal concluded that the Krsna of Vrndavana,
that of Mathura and that of Dvaraka were different personalities. Histori-
cally there is no truth in this conclusion. The Krsna of Kuruksetra and the
Krsna of Dvaraka are one and the same personality.

The citizens of Dvaraka were thus in a state of melancholy due to the
Lord’s absence from the transcendental city, as much as we are put in a
state of melancholy at night because of the absence of the sun. The sound
heralded by Lord Krsna was something like the heralding of the sunrise in
the morning. So all the citizens of Dvaraka awoke from a state of slumber
because of the sunrise of Krsna, and they all hastened towards Him just to
have an audience. The devotees of the Lord know no oneelse as protector.

This sound of the Lord is identical with the Lord, as we have tried to
explain by the nondual position of the Lord. The material existence of our
present status is full of fear. Out of the four problems of material existence,
namely the food problem, the shelter problem, the fear problem and the
mating problem, the fear problem gives us more trouble than the others.
We are always fearful due to our ignorance of the next problem. The
whole material existence is full of problems, and thus the fear problem is
always prominent. This is due to our association with the illusory energy
of the Lord, known as maya or external energy, yet all fear is vanished as
soon as there is the sound of the Lord represented by His holy name, as it
was sounded by Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu in the following sixteen
words: Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare
Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. We can take advantage of these sounds
and be free from all threatening problems of material existence.

TRANSLATION
The citizens arrived before the Lord with their respective presentations,
offering them to the fully satisfied and self-sufficient one, who, by His
own potency, incessantly supplies others. These presentations were like
the offering of a lamp to the sun. Yet the citizens began to speak in
ecstatic language about receiving the Lord, just as wards welcome their
guardian and father.
PURPORT
The Supreme Lord Krsna is described herein as atmarama. He is self-
sufficient, and there is no need for Him to seek happiness from anything
beyond Himself. He is self-sufficient because His very transcendental
existence is total bliss. He is eternally existent; He is all-cognizant and all-
blissful. Therefore, any presentation, however valuable it may be, is not
needed by Him. But still, because He is the well-wisher for one and all,
He accepts from everyone everything that is offered to Him in pure
devotional service. It is not that He is in want for such things because the
things are themselves generated from His energy. The comparison is made
herein that it is something like offering a lamp in the worship of the sun-
god. Anything fiery and illuminating is but an emanation of the energy of
the sun, and yet to worship the sun-god it is necessary to offer him a lamp.


--- Page 183 ---
560 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 11
In the worship of the sun, there is some sort of demand made by the wor-
shiper, but in the case of devotional service of the Lord, there is no ques-
tion of demand from either side. [1 is all a sign of pure love and affection
between the Lord and the devotee.

The Lord is the Supreme Father of all living beings, and therefore those
who are conscious of this vital relation with God can make filial demands
from the Father, and the Father is pleased to supply the demands of such
obedient sons without bargaining. The Lord is just like the desire tree,
and from Him everyone can have everything by the causeless mercy of the
Lord. As the Supreme Father, the Lord, however, does not supply to a
pure devotee what is considered to be a barrier to the discharge of devo-
tional service. Those who are engaged in the devotional service of the
Lord can rise to the position of unalloyed devotional service by His
transcendental” attraction.

life. You are the supreme transcendental Lord, and inevitable time cannot
exert its influence upon You.
PURPORT
The Supreme Lord is इं Krsna, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita, Brahma-
samhita and other authorized Vedic literatures. No one is equal to or
greater than Him. and that is the verdict of all scriptures. The influence of
time and space is exerted upon the dependent living entities, who are all
parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord. The living entities are predominated
Brahman, whereas the Supreme Lord is the predominating Absolute. As
soon as we forget this clear fact, we are at once in illusion, and thus we are
put into threefold miseries, as one is put into dense darkness. The clear
consciousness of the cognizant living being is God consciousness, in which
one bows down unto Him in all circumstances.

562 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 11
PURPORT
The all-good Personality of Godhead, being the creator of the universe,
also plans for the good of all good living beings. The good living beings are
advised by the Lord to follow His good advice, and by doing so they be-
come successful in all spheres of life. There is no need to worship any deity
but the Lord. The Lord is all-powerful, and if He is satisfied by our obedi-
ence unto His lotus feet, He is competent to bestow upon us all kinds of
blessings for the successful execution of both our material and spiritual
lives. For attaining spiritual existence, the human form is a chance for all
to understand our eternal relation with God. Our relation with Him is
eternal: it can neither be broken nor vanquished. It may be forgotten for
the time being, but it can be revived also by the grace of the Lord, if we
follow His injunctions, which are revealed in the scriptures of all times and
all places.

scendental form, full of all auspiciousness.


--- Page 186 ---
Text 9] Lord Krsna’s Entrance in Dvaraka 563
PURPORT
The Lord in His eternal personal form can be seen only by the pure
devotees. The Lord is never impersonal, but He is the Supreme Absolute
Personality of Godhead possible to be visited by devotional service face to
face, which is impossible to be done even by the denizens of higher
planets. When Brahmaji and other demigods want to consult Lord Visnu,
the plenary portion of Lord Krsna, they have to wait on the shore of the
ocean of milk where Lord Visnu is lying on White Land (Svetadvipa). This
ocean of milk and the Svetadvipa planet are the replica of Vaikunthaloka
within the universe. Neither Brahmaji nor the demigods like Indra can
enter into this island of Svetadvipa, but they can stand on the shore of the
ocean of milk and transmit their message to Lord Visnu, known as
Ksirodakasayl Visnu. Therefore, the Lord is rarely seen by them, but the
inhabitants of Dvaraka, because of their being pure devotees without any
tinge of material contamination of fruitive activities and empiric philo-
sophical speculation, can see Him eye to eye by the grace of the Lord.
This is the original state of the living entities and can be attained by re-
viving our natural and constitutional state of life discovered by devo-
tional service only.

TRANSLATION
O lotus-eyed Lord, whenever You go away to Mathura, Vrndavana cr
Hastinapura to meet Your friends and relatives, every moment of Your
absence seems like a million years. O infallible one, at that time our eyes
become useless, as if bereft of sun.
PURPORT
We are all proud of our material senses for making experiments to
determine the existence of God. But we forget that our senses are not
absolute by themselves. They can only act under certain conditions. For
example, our eyes. As long as the sunshinc is there, our eyes are useful to a
certain extent. But in the absence of sunshine, the eyes are useless.
Lord Sri Krsna, being the primeval Lord, the Supreme Truth, is compared
to the sun. Without Him all our knowledge is either false or partial. The
opposite of the sun is the darkness, and similarly the opposite of Krsna is
maya or illusion. The devotees of the Lord can see everything in true
perspective due to the light disseminated by Lord Krsna. By the grace of
the Lord the pure devotee cannot be in the darkness of ignorance. There-
fore, it is necessary that we must always be in the sight of Lord Krsna so
that we can see both ourselves and the Lord with His different energies. As
we cannot see anything in the absence of the sun, so also we cannot see
anything including our own self without the factual presence of the Lord.
Without Him all our knowledge is covered by illusion.

TRANSLATION

0 master, if You live abroad all the time, then we cannot look at
Your attractive face whose smiles vanquish all our sufferings. How can we
exist without Your presence?

The Lord, who is very kind to the citizens and the devotees, upon
hearing their speeches, entered the city of Dvaraka and acknowledged all
their greetings by casting His transcendental glance over them.

PURPORT

Lord Krsna’s attraction is so powerful that once being attracted by
Him no one can tolerate separation from Him. Why is this so? Because
we are all eternally related with Him as the sun rays are eternally related
with the sun disc. The sun rays are molecular parts of the solar radiation.
Thus the sun rays and the sun cannot be separated. The separation by the
cloud is temporary and artificial, and as soon as the cloud is cleared. the
sun rays again display their natural effulgence in the presence of the sun.
Similarly, the living entities, who are molecular parts of the whole spirit,
are separated from the Lord by the artificial covering of maya, illusory
energy. This illusory energy or the curtain of maya has to be removed, and
when it is so done, the living entity can see the Lord face to face, and all
his miseries are at once removed. Every one of us wants to remove the
miseries of life, but we do not know how to do it. The solution is given
here, and it rests on us to assimilate it or not.

PURPORT
The Nagaloka planet is situated below the earth planet, and it is under-
stood that the sun rays are hampered there. The darkness of the planet is,
however, removed by the flashes of the jewels set on the head of the Nagas
(celestial serpents), and it is said that there are beautiful gardens, rivulets,
etc., for the enjoyment of the Nagas. It is understood here also that the
place is well protected by the inhabitants. So also the city of Dvaraka was
well protected by the descendants of Vrsni, who were as powerful as the
Lord, insofar as He manifested His strength upon this earth.

TRANSLATION
The city of Dvaraka Puriwas filled with the opulences of all seasons.
There were hermitages, orchards, flower gardens, parks and reservoirs of
water breeding lotus flowers all over.
PURPORT

Perfection of human civilization is made possible by utilizing the gifts of
nature in their own way. As we find herewith in the description of its opu-
lence, Dvaraka was surrounded by flower gardens and fruit orchards along
with reservoirs of water and growing lotuses. There is no mention of mills
and factories supported by slaughterhouses, which are the necessary
paraphernalia of the modern metropolis. The propensity to utilize nature’s
own gifts is still there, even in the heart of modern civilized men. The
leaders of modern civilization select their own residential quarters in a
place where there are such naturally beautiful gardens and reservoirs of
water, but they leave the common men to reside in congested areas with-
out parks and gardens. Herein of course we find a different description of
the city of Dvaraka. It is understood that the whole dhama or residential
quarter was surrounded by such gardens and parks with reservoirs of water
where lotuses grew. It is understood that all the people depended on
nature’s gifts of fruits and flowers without industrial enterprises promoting
filthy huts and slums for residential quarters. Advancement of civilization
is estimated not on the growth of mills and factories to deteriorate the
finer instincts of the human being, but it rests on developing the potent
spiritual instincts of human beings and giving them a chance to go back to
Godhead. Development of factories and mills is called ugra-karma, or
pungent activities, and such activities deteriorate the finer sentiments of
the human being and society to form a dungeon of demons.

We find herein the mention of pious trees which produce seasonal
flowers and fruits. The impious trees are useless jungles only, and they can
only be used to supply fuels. In the modern civilization such impious
trees are planted on the sides of roads. Human energy should be properly
utilized in developing the finer senses for spiritual understanding, in which
lies the solution of life. Fruits, flowers, beautiful gardens, parks and
reservoirs of waters with ducks and swans playing in the midst of lotus
flowers and cows giving sufficient milk and butter are essential for
developing the finer tissues of the human body. As against this, the
dungeons of mines, factories and workshops develop demoniac propen-

sities in the working class. The vested interests flourish at the cost of the
working class, and consequently there are severe clashes between them in
so many ways. The description of Dvaraka-dhama is the ideal of human
civilization.

The city gateway, the household doors and festooned arches along the

and slogans all combined to shade the sunshine.

Signs of decoration in special festivals were also collected from the
gifts of nature, such as the plantain trees, the mango trees, fruits and
flowers. Mango trees, coconut palms and plantain trees are still accepted
as auspicious signs. The flags mentioned above were all painted either with
the picture of Garuda or Hanuman, the two great servitors of the Lord.
For devotees, such paintings and decorations are still adored, and the
servitor of the master is paid more respects for the satisfaction of the

The highways, subways, lanes, markets and public meeting places were

where.
PURPORT

Scented waters prepared by distilling flowers like rose and keora were
requisitioned to wet the roads, streets and lanes of Dvaraka-dhama. Such
places along with the marketplace and public meeting places were
thoroughly cleansed. From the above description, it appears that the city
of Dvaraka-dhama was considerably big, containing many highways, streets,
and public meeting places with parks, gardens and reservoirs of water, all
very nicely decorated with flowers and fruits. And to welcome the Lord
such flowers and fruits with unbroken seeds of grain were also strewn over
the public places. Unbroken seeds of grain or fruits in the seedling stage
were considered auspicious, and they are still so used by the Hindus in
general on festival days.

TRANSLATION
In each and every door of the residential houses, auspicious things
like curd, unbroken fruits, sugarcane and full water pots with articles
for worship, incense and candles were all displayed.
PURPORT
The process of reception according to Vedic rites is not at all dry. The
reception was made not simply by decorating the roads and streets as
above mentioned, but by worshiping the Lord with requisite ingredients
like incense, lamps, flowers, sweets, fruits and other palatable eatables,
according to one’s capacity. All were offered to the Lord, and the rem-
nants of the foodstuff were distributed amongst the gathering citizens.
So it was not like a dry reception of these modern days. Each and every
house was ready to receive the Lord in a similar way, and thus each and
every house on the roads and streets distributed such remnants of food to
the citizens, and therefore the festival was successful. Without distribution
of food, no function is complete, and that is the way of Vedic culture.

On hearing that the most dear Krsna was approaching Dvaraka-dhama,
magnanimous Vasudeva, Akrura, Ugrasena, Balarama, the superhumanly
powerful, Pradyumna, Carudesna and Samba, the son of Jambavati, all
extremely happy, abandoned resting, sitting and dining.
PURPORT

Vasudeva: Son of King Siirasena, husband of Devaki and father of Lord
Sri Krsna. He is the brother of Kunti and father of Subhadra. Subhadra
was married with her cousin Arjuna, and this system is still prevalent in
some parts of India. Vasudeva was appointed minister of Ugrasena, and
later on he married eight daughters of Ugrasena’s brother Devaka. Devaki
is only one of them. Karhsa was his brother-in-law, and Vasudeva accepted
voluntary imprisonment by Kamsa on mutual agreement to deliver the
eighth son of Devaki. This was foiled by the will of Krsna. As maternal
uncle of the Pandavas, he took active parts in the purificatory process of
the Pandavas. He sent for the priest Kasyapa at the Satasriiga Parvata, and
he executed the functions. When Krsna appeared within the bars of Karnsa’s
prison house, He was transferred to Gokula by Vasudeva at the house of
Nanda Maharaja, the foster father of Krsna. Krsna disappeared along with
Baladeva prior to the disappearance of Vasudeva, and Arjuna (his nephew)
undertook the charge of the funeral ceremony after his disappearance.

Akrira: The commander-in-chief of the ছড়া] dynasty and a great
devotee of Lord Krsna. Akrira attained success in devotional service of
the Lord by the one single process of offering prayers. He was the husband
of Siitani, daughter of Ahiika. He supported Arjuna when Arjuna took
Subhadra forcibly away by the will of Krsna. Both Krsna and Akriira went
to see Arjuna after his successful kidnapping of Subhadra. Both of them
presented dowries to Arjuna after this incidence. Akriira was present also
when Abhimanyu, the son of Subkadra, was married with Uttara, mother
of Maharaja Pariksit. 11018, the father-in-law of Akriira, was not on good
terms with Akriira. But both of them were devotees of the Lord.

Ugrasena: One of the powerful kings of the Vrsni dynasty and cousin of
Maharaja Kuntibhoja. His other name is Ahiika. His minister was Vasudeva,


--- Page 195 ---
572 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 11
and his son was the powerful Kamsa. This Kamsa imprisoned his father
and became the King of Mathura. By the grace of Lord Krsna and His
brother Lord Baladeva, Kamsa was killed, and Ugrasena was reinstalled on
the throne. When Salva attacked the city of Dvaraka, Ugrasena fought very
valiantly and repulsed the enemy. Ugrasena inquired from Naradaji about
the divinity of Lord Krsna. When the Yadu dynasty was to be vanquished,
Ugrasena was entrusted with the iron lump produced from the womb of
Samba. He cut the iron lump into pieces and then pasted it and mixed it
up with the sea water on the coast of Dvaraka. After this, he ordered
complete prohibition within the city of Dvaraka and the kingdom. He got
salvation after his death.

Baladeva: He is the divine son of Vasudeva by his wife Rohini. He is
also known as Rohininandana, the beloved son of Rohini. He was also
entrusted to Nanda Maharaja along with His mother Rohini when Vasudeva
embraced imprisonment by mutual agreement with Kamsa. So Nanda
Maharaja is also the foster father of Baladeva along with Lord Krsna. Lord
Krsna and Lord Baladeva both were constant companions from very
childhood, although They were stepbrothers. He is the plenary manifesta-
tion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore He is as good
and powerful as Lord Krsna. He belongs to the Vispu-tattva (the principle
of Godhead). He attended the svayariivara ceremony of Draupadi along
with Sri Krsna. When Subhadra was kidnapped by Arjuna by the organized
plan of Sri Krsna, Baladeva was very angry with Arjuna and wanted to kill
him at once. जप्त Krsna, for the sake of His dear friend, fell at the feet of
Lord Baladeva and implored Him not to be so angry. Sri Baladeva was
thus satisfied. Similarly, He was once very angry with the Kauravas, and
He wanted to throw the whole city into the depths of the Yamuna. But
the Kauravas satisfied him by surrendering unto His divine lotus feet. He
was actually the seventh son of Devaki prior to the birth of Lord Krsna,
but by the will of the Lord He was transferred to the womb of Rohini to
escape the wrath of Kamsa. His other name is therefore Sankarsana, who
is also the plenary portion of Sri Baladeva. Because He was as powerful as
Lord Krsna and can bestow spiritual power to the devotees, He is therefore
known as Baladeva. In the Vedas also it is enjoined that no one can know
the Supreme Lord without being favored by Baladeva. Bala means spiritual
strength and not physical. Some less intelligent persons interpret bala as
the strength of the body. But no one can have spiritual realization by
physical strength. Physical strength ends with the end of the physical
body, but spiritual strength follows the spirit soul to the next transmigra-
tion, and therefore the strength obtained by Baladeva is never wasted.


--- Page 196 ---
Texts 16-17] Lord Krsna’s Entrance in Dvaraka 573
The strength is eternal, and thus Baladeva is the original spiritual master of
all devotees.

Sri Baladeva was also a class friend of Lord Sri Krsna as a student of
Sandipani Muni. In His childhood He killed many asuras along with Sri
Krsna, and specifically He killed the Dhenukasura at Talavana. During the
Kuruksetra battle, He remained neutral, and He tried his best not to bring
about the fight. He was in favor of Duryodhana, but still He remained
neutral. When there was a club-fight between Duryodhana and Bhimasena,
He was present on the spot. He was angry at Bhimasena when the latter
struck Duryodhana on the thigh or below the belt, and He wanted to
retaliate the unfair action. Lord Sri Krsna saved Bhima from His wrath.
But He left the place at once, being disgusted at Bhimasena, and after His
departure Duryodhana fell to the ground to meet his death. The funeral
ceremony of Abhimanyu, the son of Arjuna, was performed by Him, as
He was the maternal uncle. It was impossible to be performed by any one
of the Pandavas, who were all overwhelmed with grief. At the last stage,
He departed from this world by producing a great white snake from His
mouth, and thus He was carried by = in the shape of a serpent.

Pradyumna: Incarnation of Kamadeva or, according to others, incarna-
tion of Sanat-kumara, born as the son of the Personality of Godhead Lord
Sri Krsna and Laksmidevi Srimati Rukmini, the principal queen at Dvaraka.
He was one of those who went to congratulate Arjuna upon marrying
Subhadra. He was one of the great generals who fought with Salva, and
while fighting with him he became unconscious on the battlefield. His
charioteer brought him back to the camp from the battlefield, and for this
action he was very sorry and rebuked his charioteer. However, he fought
again with Silva and was victorious. He heard all about the different
demigods from Naradaji. He is one of the four plenary expansions of Lord
Sri Krsna. He is the third one. He inquired from his father Sri Krsna about
the glories of the brahmanas. During the fratricidal war amongst the
descendants of Yadu, he died at the hand of Bhoja, another king of the
Vrsnis. After his death, he was installed in his original position.

Carudesna: Another son of Lord Sri Krsna and Rukminidevi. He was
also present during the svayarivara ceremony of Draupadi. He was a great
warrior like his brothers and father. He fought with Vivindhaka and killed
him in the fight.

Samba: One of the great heroes of the Yadu dynasty and the son of
Lord Sri Krsna by His wife Jambavati. He learned the military art of
throwing arrows from Arjuna, and he became a member of parliament
during the time of Maharaja Yudhisthira. He was present during the


--- Page 197 ---
574 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 11
Rajasiiya-yajna of Maharaja Yudhisthira. When all the Vrsnis were as-
sembled during the time of Pravada-yajiia, his glorious activities were
narrated by Satyaki before Lord Baladeva. He was also present along with
his father Lord Sri Krsna during the Aévamedha-yajfia performed by
Yudhisthira. He was presented before some rsis falsely dressed as a preg-
nant woman by his brothers, and in fun he asked the rsis what he was
going to deliver. The rsis replied that he would deliver a lump of iron,
whieh would be the cause of fratricidal war in the family of Yadu. The
next day, in the morning, Samba delivered a large lump of iron, which
was entrusted with Ugrasena for necessary action. Actually later on there
was the foretold fratricidal war, and Samba died in that war.

So all these sons of Lord Krsna left their respective palaces and leaving
aside all engagements, including lying down, sitting and dining, hastened
towards their exalted father.

shells and bugles were sounded, and Vedic hymns were chanted. Thus they
offered their respects, which were saturated with affection.
PURPORT
The Vedic way of receiving a great personality creates an atmosphere of
respect, which is saturated with affection and veneration for the person
received. The auspicious atmosphere of such a reception depends on the
paraphernalia described above, including conchshell, flowers, incense,
decorated elephants, and the qualified brahmanas reciting verses from the
Vedic literatures. Such a program of reception is full of sincerity, both on
the part of the receiver and the received.

At the same time, many hundreds of well-known prostitutes began to

and their beautiful faces were decorated with dazzling earrings, which
enhanced the beauty of their foreheads.
PURPORT
We may not hate even the prostitutes if they are devotees of the Lord.
Even to date there are many prostitutes in great cities of India who are
sincerely devotees of the Lord. By tricks of chance one may be obliged
to adopt a profession which is not very adorable in society, but that does


--- Page 199 ---
576 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 11
not hamper one in executing devotional service to the Lord. Devotional
service of the Lord is uncheckable in all circumstances. It is understood
herewith that even in those days, about 5,000 years ago, there were
prostitutes in a city like Dvaraka, where Lord Krsna resided. This means
that prostitutes are necessary citizens for the proper upkeep of society.
The government opens wine shops, but this does not mean that the
government encourages the drinking of wine. The idea is that there is a
class of men who will drink at any cost, and it has been experienced that
prohibition in great cities encouraged illicit smuggling of wine. Similarly,
men who are not satisfied at home require such concessions, and if there
is no prostitute, then such low men will induce others into prostitution.
It is better that prostitutes be available in the marketplace so that the
sanctity of society can be maintained. It is better to maintain a class of
prostitutes than to encourage prostitutes within society. The real reforma-
tion is to enlighten all people to become devotees of the Lord, and that
will check all kinds of deteriorating factors of life.

Sri Bilvamangala Thakur, a great dcarya of the Visnusvami Vaisnava sect,
in his householder life was overly attached to a prostitute who happened
to be a devotee of the Lord. One night when the Thakur came to
Cintamani’s house in torrents of rain and thunder, Cintamani was aston-
ished to see how the Thakur could come on such a dreadful night after
crossing a foaming river which was full of waves. She said to Thakur
Bilvamangala that his attraction for the flesh and bone of an insignificant
woman like her would be properly utilized if it could be diverted to
devotional service of the Lord to achieve attraction for the transcendental
beauty of the Lord. It was a momentous hour for the Thakur, and he took
a turn towards spiritual realization by the words of a prostitute. Later on
the Thakur accepted the prostitute as his spiritual master, and in several
places of his literary works he has glorified the name of Cintamani, who
showed him the right path.

In the Bhagavad-gita (Bg. 9.32) the Lord says, ““O son of Prtha, even the
low-born candalas and those who are born in a family of unbelievers, and
even the prostitutes, shall attain perfection of life if they take shelter of
unalloyed devotional service to Me because in the path of devotional
service there are no impediments due to degraded birth and occupation.
The path is open for everyone who agrees to follow it.”

It appears that the prostitutes of Dvaraka, who were so eager to meet
the Lord, were all His unalloyed devotees, and thus they were all on the
path of salvation according to the above version of the Bhagavad-gita.
Therefore, the only reformation that is necessary in society is to make an


--- Page 200 ---
Text 20] Lord Krsna’s Entrance in Dvaraka 577
organized effort to turn the citizens into devotees of the Lord, and thus
all good qualities of the denizens of heaven will overtake them in their
own way. On the other hand, those who are nondevotees have no good
qualifications whatsoever, however they may be materially advanced. The
difference is that the devotees of the Lord are on the path of liberation,
whereas the nondevgtees are on the path of further entanglement in
material bondage. The criterion of advancement of civilization is whether
the people are educated and advanced on the path of salvation.

Expert dramatists, artists, dancers, singers, historians, genealogists and

PURPORT
It appears that 5,000 years ago the society also needed the services of
the dramatists, artists, dancers, singers, historians, genealogists, public
speakers, etc. Dancers, singers and dramatic artists mostly hailed from
the $8070৫ community, whereas the learned historians, genealogists and
public speakers hailed from the brahmana community. All of them be-
longed to a particular caste, and they became so trained in their respective
families. Such dramatists, dancers, singers, historians, genealogists and


--- Page 201 ---
578 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 11
public speakers would dwell on the subject of the Lord’s superhuman
activities in different ages and millenniums, and not on ordinary events.
Nor were they in chronological order. All the Puranas are historical facts
described only in relation with the Supreme Lord in different ages and
times as well as on different planets also. Therefore, we do not find any
chronological order. The modern historians, therefore, cannot catch up
the link, and thus they unauthoritatively remark that the Puranas are all
imaginary stories only.

Even one hundred years ago in India, all dramatic performances were
centered round the superhuman activities of the Supreme Lord. The
common people would be verily entertained by the performances of
dramas, and yatra parties played wonderfully on the superhuman activities
of the Lord, and thus even the illiterate agriculturist would be a participant
in the knowledge of Vedic literature, despite a considerable lack of aca-
demic qualifications. Therefore, expert players in drama, dancers, singers,
speakers, etc., are required for the spiritual enlightenment of the common
man. The genealogists would give account completely of the descendants
of a particular family. Even at the present moment the guides in the
pilgrimages of India submit a complete account of genealogical tables
before a newcomer. This wonderful act sometimes attracts more customers
to receive such important information.

TRANSLATION
Lord Krsna, the Personality of Godhead, approached them and offered
due honor and respect to each and every one of the friends, relatives,
citizens and all others who came to receive and welcome Him.
PURPORT
The Supreme Lord Personality of Godhead is neither impersonal nor an
inert object unable to reciprocate the feelings of His devotees. Here the
word yathavidhi or “just as it behooves” is significant. He reciprocates
“just as it behooves” with His different types of admirers and devotees. Of
course, the pure devotees are of one type only because they have no other
object for service but the Lord, and therefore the Lord also reciprocates
with such pure devotees just as it behooves, namely, He is always attentive
to all the matters of His pure devotees. There are others who designate
Him as impersonal, and so the Lord also does not take any personal
interest. He satisfies everyone in terms of one’s development of spiritual
consciousness, and a sample of such reciprocation is exhibited here with
His different welcomers.

The Almighty Lord greeted everyone present by bowing His head,
exchanging greetings, embracing, shaking hands, looking and smiling, giving
assurances and awarding benedictions, even to the lowest in rank.
PURPORT
To receive the Lord Sri Krsna there were all grades of population
beginning from Vasudeva, Ugrasena, Gargamuni, etc., i.e. the father,
grandfather, teacher, etc., down to the prostitutes and candalas, who are
accustomed to eat dogs. And every one of them was properly greeted by
the Lord in terms of rank and position. As pure living entities, all are the
separated parts and parcels of the Lord, and thus no one is alien by His
eternal relation. Such pure living entities are graded differently in terms
of contamination of the modes of material nature, but the Lord is equally
affectionate to all His parts and parcels, despite material gradation. He
descends only to recall these materialistic living beings back to His
kingdom, and intelligent persons take advantage of this facility offered by
the Personality of Godhead to all living beings. No one is rejected by the
Lord for being accepted in the kingdom of God, and it remains with the
living being to accept this or not.

TRANSLATION
Then the Lord personally entered the city accompanied by elderly
relatives and invalid brahmanas with their wives, all offering benedictions
and singing the glories of the Lord. Others also praised the glories of the
Lord.
PURPORT

The brahmanas in society were never attentive in banking money for
future retired life. When they were old invalids, they used to approach the
assembly of the kings, and simply by praising the glorious deeds performed
by the kings, along with their wives, they would be provided with all
necessities of life. Such brahmanpas were not, so to speak, flatterers of the
kings, but the kings were actually glorified by their actions, and they were
sincerely still more encouraged in pious acts by such 07৫10701805 in a
dignified way. Lord Sri Krsna is worthy of all glories, and the praying
brahmanas and others were glorified themselves by chanting the glories of
the Lord.

to have a look at the Lord. They considered this to be the greatest festival.


--- Page 205 ---
582 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 11
PURPORT

To have a look at the Lord is a great festive occasion undoubtedly, as it
was considered by the metropolitan ladies of Dvaraka. Thisis still followed
by the devout ladies of India. Especially during the days of the Jhulana
and Janmastami ceremonies, the ladies of India still throng up in the
greatest number at the temple of the Lord, where His transcendental
eternal form is worshiped. The transcendental form of the Lord installed
in a temple is not different from the Lord personally. Such a form of the
Lord is called arca-vigraha, or arca incarnation, and is expanded by the
Lord by His internal potency just to facilitate the devotional service of His
innumerable devotees who are in the material world. The material senses
cannot perceive the spiritual nature of the Lord, and therefore the Lord
accepts the arca-vigraha which is apparently made of material elements
like earth, wood, stone, etc., but actually there is no material contami-
nation. The Lord being kaivalya (one alone), there is no matter in Him. He
is one without a second, and therefore the Almighty Lord can appear in
any form without being contaminated by the material conception. There-
fore, festivities in the temple of the Lord, as held generally, are like
festivals performed during the manifestive days of the Lord of Dvaraka,
about 5,000 years ago. The authorized acaryas, who know the science
perfectly, install such temples of the Lord under regulative principles just
to offer facilities to the common man, but persons who are less intelligent,
without being conversant with the science, mistake this great attempt to
be idol worship and poke their nose into that to which they have no
access. Therefore, the ladies or men who observe festivals in the temples
of the Lord just to have a look at the transcendental form are a thousand
times more glorious than those who are nonbelievers in the transcendental
form of the Lord.

It appears from the verse that the inhabitants of Dvaraka were all owners
of big palaces. This indicates the prosperity of the city. The ladies got up
on the roofs just to have a look at the procession and the Lord. The ladies
did not mix with the crowd on the street, and thus their respectability was
perfectly observed. There was no artificial equality with the man. Female
respectability is preserved more elegantly by keeping her separate from the
man. The sexes should not mix unrestrictedly.

TRANSLATION
The inhabitants of Dvaraka were regularly accustomed to look upon
the reservoir of all beauty, the infallible Lord, yet they were never satiated.
PURPORT

When the ladies of the city of Dvaraka got up on the roofs of their
palaces, they never thought that they had previously many times seen the
beautiful body of the infallible Lord. This indicates that they had no
satiation in desiring to see the Lord. Anything material seen for a number
of times ultimately becomes unattractive by the law of satiation. The law
of satiation acts materially, but there is no scope for it in the spiritual
realm. The word infallible is significant here, because although the Lord
has mercifully descended-on earth, He is still infallible. The living entities
are fallible because when they come in contact with the material world
they lack their spiritual identity, and thus the body materially obtained
becomes subjected to birth, growth, transformation, situation, deteriora-
tion and annihilation under the laws of nature. The Lord’s body is not
like that. He descends as He is and is never under the laws of the material
modes. His body is the source of everything that be, the reservoir of all
beauties beyond our experience. No one, therefore, is satiated by seeing
the transcendental body of the Lord because there are always manifesta-
tions of newer and newer beauties. The transcendental name, form,
qualities, entourage, etc., are all spiritual manifestations, and there is no
satiation in chanting the holy name of the Lord, there is no satiation in
discussing the qualities of the Lord, and there is no limitation of the

entourage of the Lord. He is the source of all and is limitless.

TRANSLATION
The Lord’s chest is the abode of the goddess of fortune. His moonlike
face is the drinking vessel for eyes which hanker after all that is beautiful.
His arms are resting places for the administrative demigods. And His lotus
feet are the refuge of pure devotees who never talk or sing of any subject
except His Lordship.
PURPORT
There are different classes of human beings, all seeking different enjoy-
ments from different objects. There are persons who are seeking after the
favor of the goddess of fortune, and for them the Vedic literatures give
information that the Lord is always served with all reverence by thousands
and thousands of goddesses of fortune at the cintamani-dhama,* the
transcendental abode of the Lord where the trees are all desire-trees and
the buildings are made of touchstone. The Lord Govinda is engaged there
in herding the surabhi cows as His natural occupation. These goddesses of

fortune can be seen automatically if we are attracted by the bodily features
of the Lord. The impersonalists cannot observe such goddesses of fortune
because of their dry speculative habit. And those who are artists, overtaken
by the beautiful creation, should better see to the beautiful face of the
Lord for complete satisfaction. The face of the Lord is the embodiment of
beauty. What they call beautiful nature is but His smile, and what they
call the sweet songs of the birds are but specimens of the whispering voice
of the Lord. There are administrative demigods in charge of departmental
service of cosmic management, and there are tiny administrative gods in
the state service. They are always afraid of other competitors, but if they
take shelter of the arms of the Lord, the Lord can protect them always
from the attacks of enemies. A faithful servant of the Lord engaged in the
service of administration is the ideal executive head and can well protect
the interest of the people in general. Other so-called administrators are
symbols of anachronisms leading to the acute distress of the people who
are governed by them. The administrators can remain safely under the
protection of the arms of the Lord. The essence of everything is the
Supreme Lord: He is called the 5৫7077. And those who sing and talk about
Him are called the sarangas, or the pure devotees. The pure devotees are
always hankering after the lotus feet of the Lord. The lotus has a kind of
honey which is transcendentally relished by the devotees. They are like
the bees who are always after the honey. da Riipa Gosvami, the great
devotee dcarya of the Gaudiya-Vaisnava-sampradaya, has sung a song about
this lotus honey, comparing himself to the bee: ““O my Lord Krsna, I beg
to offer my prayers unto You. My mind is like the bee, and it is after some
honey. Kindly, therefore, give my bee-mind a place at Your lotus feet,
which are the resources for all transcendental honey. I know that even big
demigods like Brahma do not see the rays of the nails of Your lotus feet,
even though they are engaged in deep meditation for years together. Still,
O infallible one, my ambition is such, for You are very merciful to your
surrendered devotees. O Madhava, I know also that I have no genuine
devotion for the service of Your lotus feet, but because Your Lordship is
inconceivably powerful, You can do what is impossible to be done. Your
lotus feet can deride even the nectar of the heavenly kingdom, and there-
fore I am very much attracted by them. O supreme eternal, please,
therefore, let my mind be fixed at Your lotus feet so that eternally I may
be able to relish the taste of Your transcendental service.” The devotees
are satisfied with being placed at the lotus feet of the Lord and have no
ambition to see His all-beautiful face or aspire for the protection of the
strong arms of the Lord. They are humble by nature, and the Lord is
always leaning towards such humble devotees.

TRANSLATION
As the Lord passed along the public road of Dvaraka, His head was
protected from the sunshine by a white umbrella. White feathered fans
moved in semicircles, and showers of flowers fell upon the road. His yellow
garments and garlands of flowers made it appear as if a dark cloud were
surrounded simultaneously by sun, moon, lightning and rainbows.
PURPORT
The sun, moon, rainbow and lightning do not appear in the sky simul-

taneously. When there is sun, the moonlight becomes insignificant, and if
there are clouds and a rainbow, there is no manifestation of lightning. The
Lord’s bodily hue is just like a new monsoon cloud. He is compared herein
to the cloud. The white umbrella over His head is compared to the sun.
The movement of the bunch-hair fan of flukes is compared to the moon.
The showers of flowers are compared to the stars. His yellow garments are
compared to the rainbow. So all these activities of the firmament, being
impossible simultaneous factors, cannot be adjusted by comparison. The
adjustment is only possible when we think of the inconceivable potency

of the Lord. The Lord is all-powerful, and in His presence anything
impossible can be made possible by His inconceivable energy. But the
situation created at the time of His passing on the roads of Dvaraka
was beautiful and could not be compared to anything besides the descrip-
tion of natural phenomena.

TRANSLATION
After entering the house of His father, He was embraced by the moth-
ers present, and the Lord offered His obeisances unto them by placing His
head at their feet. The mothers were headed by Devaki [His real mother].
PURPORT

It appears that Vasudeva, the father of Lord Krsna, had completely sepa-
rate residential quarters where he lived with his eighteen wives, out of
whom Srimati Devak is the real mother of Lord Krsna. But inspite of this,
all other stepmothers were equally affectionate to Him, as will be evident
from the following verse. Lord Krsna also did not distinguish His real
mother from His stepmothers, and He equally offered His obeisances unto
all the wives of Vasudeva present on the occasion. According to scriptures
also, there are seven mothers: 1) the real mother, 2) the wife of the
spiritual master, 3) the wife of a brahmana, 4) the wife of the king, 5) the
cow, 6) the nurse, and 7) the earth. All of them are mothers. Even by this
injunction of the $astras, the stepmother, who is the wife of the father, is


--- Page 211 ---
588 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 11
also as good as the mother because the father is also one of the spiritual
masters. Lord Krsna, the Lord of the universe, plays the part of an ideal son
just to teach others how to treat their stepmothers.

The mothers, after embracing their son, sat Him on their laps. Due to
pure affection, milk sprang from their breasts. They were overwhelmed
with delight, and the tears from their eyes wetted the Lord.
PURPORT
When Lord Krsna was at Vrndavana even the cows would become
moistened by affection towards Him, and He would draw milk from the
nipples of every affectionate living being, so what to speak of the step-
mothers who were already as good as His own mother.

TRANSLATION
Thereafter, the Lord entered His palaces, which were perfect to the
fullest extent. His wives lived in them, and they numbered over sixteen
thousand.
PURPORT
Lord Krsna had 16,108 wives, and for each and every one of them there
was a fully equipped palace complete with necessary compounds and
gardens. Full description of these palaces is given in the Tenth Canto. All
the palaces were made of the best marble stone. They were illuminated by
jewels and decorated by curtains and carpets of velvet and silk, nicely
bedecked and embroidered with gold lace. The Personality of Godhead
means one who is full with all power, all energy, all opulences, all
beauties, all knowledge and all renunciation. Therefore, in the palaces of
the Lord there was nothing wanting for fulfilling all desires of the Lord.
The Lord is unlimited, and therefore His desires are also unlimited, and the
supply is also unlimited. Everything being unlimited, it is shortly described
here as sarva-kamam, or full with all desirable equipment.

TRANSLATION
The queens of Lord Sri Krsna rejoiced within their minds to see their
husband home after a long period abroad. The queens got up at once
from their seats and meditations. As was socially customary, they covered
their faces shyly and looked about coyly.
PURPORT
As mentioned above, the Lord entered His home palaces occupied by
16,108 queens. This means that the Lord at once expanded Himself in as
many plenary expansions as there were queens and palaces and entered in
each and every one of them simultaneously and separately. Here is another
manifestation of the feature of His internal potency: He can expand
Himself in as many forms of spiritual identity as He desires, even though
He is one without a second. It is confirmed by the sruti mantra that the
Absolute is one alone, and yet He becomes many as soon as He so desires.
These manifold expansions of the Supreme Lord are manifested as plenary
and separated portions. The separated portions are representations of His
energy, and the plenary portions are manifestations of His Personality.
Thus the Personality of Godhead manifested Himself in 16,108 plenary
expansions and simultaneously entered into each and every one of the
palaces of the queens. This is called vaibhava, or the transcendental
potency of the Lord. And because He can do so, He is also known as
yogesvara. Ordinarily a yogi or mystic living being is able to expand him-
self at utmost to tenfold expansions of his body, but the Lord can do so
to the extent of as many thousands or infinitely, as He likes. Unbelievers
become astonished to learn that Lord Krsna married more than 16,000
queens because they think of Lord Krsna as one of them and measure the
potency. of the Lord by their own limited potency. One should know,
therefore, that the Lord is never on the level of the living beings who are
but expansions of His marginal potency, and one should never equalize


--- Page 214 ---
Text 31] Lord Krsna’s Entrance in Dvaraka 591
the potent and the potency, although there is very little difference of
quality between the potent and the potency. The queens were also
expansions of His internal potency, and thus the potent and potencies are
perpetually exchanging transcendental pleasures, known as pastimes of the
Lord. One should not, therefore, become astonished to learn that the
Lord married so many wives. On the contrary, one should affirm that even
if the Lord marries sixteen thousand million wives, He is not completely
manifesting His unlimited and inexhaustible potency. He married only
16,000 wives and entered in each and every one of the different palaces
just to impress in the history of the human beings on the surface of the
earth that the Lord is never equal to or lesser than any human being,
however powerful he may be. No one is, therefore, either equal to or
greater than the Lord. The Lord is always great in all respects. “God is
great” is eternal truth.

Therefore, as soon as the queens saw from a distance their husband,
who was away from home for long periods due to the Battle of Kuruksetra,
they all arose from the slumber of meditation and prepared to receive
their most beloved. According to Yajfiavalkya’s religious injunctions, a
woman whose husband is away from home should not take part in any
social functions, should not decorate her body, should not laugh and
should not go to any relative’s house in any circumstance. This is the vow
of the ladies whose husbands are away from home. At the same time, it is
also enjoined that a wife should never present herself before the husband
in an unclean state. She must decorate herself with ornaments and good
dress and should always be present before the husband in a happy and
joyous mood. The queens of Lord Krsna were all in meditation, thinking
of the Lord’s absence, and were always meditating upon Him. The Lord’s
devotees cannot live for a moment without meditating on the Lord, and
what to speak of the queens who were all goddesses of fortune incarnated
as queens in the pastimes of the Lord at Dvaraka. They can never be
separated from the Lord, either by presence or by trance. The gopis at
Vrndavana could not forget the Lord when the Lord was away in the for-
est cow herding. When the Lord boy Krsna was absent from the village,
the gopis at home used to worry about Him traversing the rough ground
with His soft lotus feet. By thinking thus, they were sometimes over-
whelmed in trance and mortified in the heart. Such is the condition of the
pure associates of the Lord. They are always in trance, and so the queens
also were in trance during the absence of the Lord. Presently, having seen
the Lord from a distance, they at once gave up all their engagements,
including the vows of women as described above. According to Sri


--- Page 215 ---
592 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 11
Vidvanitha Cakravarti Thakur, there was a regular psychological reaction
on the occasion. First of all, rising from their seats, although they wanted
to see the husband, they were deterred because of feminine shyness. But
due to strong ecstasy, they overcame that stage of weakness and became
caught up with the idea of embracing the Lord, and this thought factually
made them unconscious of their surrounding environment. This prime
state of ecstasy annihilated all other formalities and social conventions,
and thus they escaped all stumbling blocks in the path of meeting the
Lord. And that is the perfect stage of meeting the Lord of the soul, ऽप
Krsna.

The insuperable ecstasy was so strong that the queens, who were shy,
first embraced the Lord in the innermost recesses of their hearts. Then
they embraced Him visually, and then they sent their sons to embrace Him
[which is equal to personal embracing]. But, O chief amongst the Bhrgus,
though they tried to restrain their feelings, they inadvertently shed tears.


--- Page 216 ---
Text 33) Lord Krsna’s Entrance in Dvaraka 593
PURPORT
Although due to feminine shyness there were many hindrances to
embracing the dear husband Lord Sri Krsna, the queens performed that
act by seeing Him, by putting Him in the core of their hearts, and by
sending their sons to embrace Him. Still, the act remained unfinished, and
tears rolled down their cheeks despite all endeavors to check them. One in-
directly embraces the husband by sending the son to embrace him because
the son is developed as part of the mother’s body. The embrace of the son
is not exactly the embrace of husband and wife from the sexual point of
view, but the embrace is satisfaction from the affectionate point of view.
The embrace of the eyes is more effective in the conjugal relation, and
thus according to Srila Jiva Gosvami there is nothing wrong in such an ex-
change of feeling between husband and wife.

Although Lord Sri Krsna was constantly by their sides, as well as

--- Page 217 ---

goddess of fortune, although by nature always restless and moving, could
not quit the Lord's feet. So what woman can be detached from those feet,
having once taken shelter of them?

PURPORT

Conditioned living beings are always after the favor of the goddess of
fortune, although by nature she is moving from one place to another. In
the material world no one is permanently fortunate, however clever one
may be. There have been so many big empires in different parts of the
world, there have been so many powerful kings all over the world, and
there have been so many fortunate men, but all of them have been
liquidated gradually. This is the law of material nature. But spiritually it is
different. According to Brahma-samhita, the l.ord is served very respect-
fully by hundreds and thousands of goddesses of fortune. They are always
in alonely place also with the Lord. But still the association of the Lord is
so inspiringly newer and newer that they cannot quit the Lord for a
moment, even though they are by nature very restless and are moving
about. The spiritual relation with the Lord is so enlivening and resourceful
that no one can leave the company of the Lord, once having taken shelter
of it.

The living beings are by constitution feminine by nature. The male or
enjoyer is the Lord, and all manifestations of His different potencies are
feminine by nature. In the Bhagavad-gita, the living beings are designated
as para-prakrti, or the superior potency. The material elements are apara-
prakrti, or inferior potency. Such potencies are always employed for the
satisfaction of the employer or the enjoyer. The supreme enjoyer is the
Lord Himself, as stated in the Bhagavad-gita (Bg. 5.29). The potencies,
therefore, when engaged directly in the service of the Lord, revive the
natural color, and thus there is no disparity in the relation of the potent
and potency.

Generally people engaged in service are always seeking some post under
the government or the supreme enjoyer of the state. Since the Lord is the
supreme enjoyer of everything in or outside the universe, it is happiness to
be employed by Him. Once engaged in the supreme governmental service
of the Lord, no living being wishes to be relieved from the engagement.
The highest perfection of human life is to seek some employment under
the Lord’s supreme service. That will make one extremely happy. One
need not seek the moving goddess of fortune without the relation of the
Lord.

TRANSLATION
The Lord was pacified after killing those kings who were burdensome
to the earth. They were puffed up with their military strength, their horses,
elephants, chariots, infantry, etc. He Himself was not a party in the fight.
He simply created hostility between the powerful administrators, and they
fought amongst themselves. He was like the wind which causes friction
between bamboos and so sparks a fire.
PURPORT
As stated above, the living beings are not factual enjoyers of things
which are manifested as God’s creation. The Lord is the genuine proprietor
and enjoyer of everything manifested in His creation. Unfortunately,
influenced by the deluding energy, the living being becomes a false enjoyer
under the dictation of the modes of nature. Puffed up by such a false
sense of becoming God, the deluded living being increases his material
strength by so many activities and thus becomes the burden of the earth,


--- Page 219 ---
596 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 11
so much so that the earth becomes completely uninhabitable by the sane.
This state of affairs is called dharmasya glanih, or misuse of the energy of
the human being. When such misuse of human energy is prominent, the
saner living beings become perturbed by the awkward situation created by
the vicious administrators who are simply burdens of the earth, and the
Lord appears by His internal potency just to save the saner section of
humanity and to alleviate the burden due to the earthly administrators in
different parts of the world. He does not favor either of the unwanted
administrators, but by His potential power He creates hostility between
such unwanted administrators, as the air creates fire in the forest by the
friction of the bamboos. The fire in the forest takes place automatically by the
force of the air, and similarly the hostility between different groups of
politicians takes place by the unseen design of the Lord. The unwanted
administrators, puffed up by false power and military strength, thus
become engaged in fighting amongst themselves over ideological conflicts
and so exhaust themselves of all powers. The history of the world reflects
this factual will of the Lord, and it will continue to be enacted until the
living beings are attached to the service of the Lord.In the Bhagavad-gita
this fact is very vividly described (Bg. 7.14-15). It is said, “The deluding
energy is My potency, and thus it is not possible for the dependent living
beings to supersede the strength of the material modes. But those who take
shelter in Me [the Personality of Godhead Sri Krsna] can cross over the
gigantic ocean of material energy.” This means that no one can establish
peace and prosperity in the world by fruitive activities or by speculative
philosophy or ideology. The only way is to surrender unto the Supreme
Lord and thus become free from the illusion of the deluding energy.
Unfortunately persons who are engaged in destructive work are unable
to surrender unto the Personality of Godhead. They are all fools of the
first order; they are the lowest of the human species of life; they are
robbed of their knowledge, although apparently they seem to be academi-
cally educated. They are all of the demoniac mentality, always challenging
the supreme power of the Lord. Those who are very materialistic, always
hankering after material power and strength, are undoubtedly fools of the
first order because they have no information of the living energy, and being
ignorant of that supreme spiritual science, they are absorbed in material
science, which ends with the end of the material body. They are the
lowest of human beings because the human life is especially meant for
reestablishing the lost relation with the Lord, and they miss this oppor-
tunity by being engaged in material activities. They are robbed of their
knowledge because even after prolonged speculation they cannot reach
to the stage of knowing the Personality of Godhead, the summum bonum


--- Page 220 ---

of everything. And all of them are men of demonic principle, and they
suffer the consequences, as did such materialistic heroes as Ravana,
Hiranyakasipu, Karhsa and others.

TRANSLATION
That Supreme Personality of Godhead Sri Krsna, out of His causeless
mercy, appeared on this planet by His internal potency and enjoyed Him-
self amongst competent women as if He were engaging in mundane affairs.
PURPORT
The Lord married and lived like a householder. This is certainly like a
mundane affair, but when we learn that He married 16,108 wives and
lived with them separately in each and every palace, certainly it is not
mundane. Therefore, the Lord, living as a householder amongst His
competent wives, is never mundane, and His behavior with them is never
to be understood as mundane sex relation. The women who became the
wives of the Lord are certainly not ordinary women, because to get the
Lord as one’s husband is the result of many, many millions of births’
tapasya (austerity). When the Lord appearson different lokas, or planets,
oron this planet of human beings, He displays His transcendental pastimes
just to attract the conditioned souls to become His eternal servitors,

the Lord eternally reciprocates such exchanges of service. Service is
pervertedly represented in the material world and broken untimely, result-
ing in sad experience. The illusioned living being conditioned by material
nature cannot understand out of ignorance that all our relations here in
the mundane world are temporary and full of inebrieties. Such relations
cannot help us be happy perpetually, but if the same relation is established
with the Lord, then we are transferred to the transcendental world after
leaving this material body and become eternally related with Him in the
relation we desire. The women amongst whom He lived as their husband
are not, therefore, women of this mundane world, but are eternally related
with Him as transcendental wives, a position which they attained by
perfection of devotional service. That is their competency. The Lord is
param brahma, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Conditioned souls
seek after perpetual happiness in all places—not only on this earth but also
on other planets throughout the universe because constitutionally a spiritual
spark, as he is, can travel to any part of God’s creation. But being
conditioned by the material modes, he tries to travel in space by space-
craft and so fails to reach his destination. The law of gravitation is binding
upon him like the shackles of a prisoner. By other processes he can reach
anywhere, but even if he reaches the highest planet, he cannot attain
that perpetual happiness which he is searching after life after life. When he
comes, however, to his senses, he seeks after Brahman happiness, knowing
it for certain that unlimited happiness, which he is seeking, is never attain-
able in the material world. As such, the Supreme Being, Param Brahman,
certainly does not seek His happiness anywhere in the material world. Nor
can His paraphernalia of happiness be found in the material world. He
is not impersonal. Because He is the leader and Supreme Being amongst
innumerable living beings, He cannot be impersonal. He is exactly like us,
and He has all the propensities of an individual living being in fullness. He
marries exactly like us, but His marriage is neither mundane nor limited by
our experience in the conditioned state. His wives, therefore, appear like
mundane women, but factually they are all transcendental liberated souls,
perfect manifestations of internal energy.

TRANSLATION
Although the queens’ beautiful smiles and furtive glances were all
spotless and exciting, and although they could conquer Cupid himself by
making him give up his bow in frustration, and although even the tolerant
Siva could fall victim to them, still, despite all their magical feats and
attractions, they could not agitate the senses of the Lord.
PURPORT
The path of salvation or the path of going back to Godhead always
forbids the association of women, and the complete sanatana-dharma or
varnasrama-dharma scheme forbids or restricts association with women.
How, then, can one be accepted as the Supreme Personality of Godhead
who is addicted to more than sixteen thousand wives? This question may
be relevantly raised by inquisitive persons really anxious to know about
the transcendental nature of the Supreme Lord. And to answer such
questions, the sages at Naimisiranya have discussed the transcendental
character of the Lord in this and in following verses. It is clear herein that
the feminine attractive features which can conquer Cupid or even the
supermost tolerant Lord Siva could not conquer the senses of the Lord.
Cupid’s business is to invoke mundane lust. The whole universe is moving
being agitated by Cupid’s arrow. The activities of the world are being
carried on by the central attraction of male and female. A male is search-
ing after a mate to his liking, and the female is looking after a suitable
male. That is the way of material stimulus. And as soon as a male is


--- Page 223 ---
600 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 11
combined with a female, the material bondage of the living being is at
once tightly interlocked by sex relation, and as a result of this, both the
male and female’sattraction for sweet home, motherland, bodily offspring,
society and friendship and accumulation of wealth become the illusory
field of activities, and thus a false but indefatigable attraction for the
temporary material existence, which is full of miseries, is manifest. Those
who are, therefore, on the path of salvation for going back home and back
to Godhead are especially advised by all scriptural instruction to become
free from such paraphernalia of material attraction. And that is possible
only by the association of the devotees of the Lord who are called the
mahatmas. Cupid, therefore, throws his arrow upon the living beings to
make them mad after the opposite sex, whether the party is actually
beautiful or not. Cupid’s provocations are going on, even among beastly
societies who are all ugly-looking in the estimation of the civilized nations.
Thus Cupid’s influence is exerted even amongst the ugliest forms, and what
to speak of the most perfect beauties. Lord Siva, who is considered to be
most tolerant, was also struck by Cupid’s arrow because he also became
mad after the Mohini incarnation of the Lord and acknowledged himself
to be defeated. Cupid, however, was himself captivated by the grave and
exciting dealings of the goddesses of fortune, and he voluntarily gave up his
bow and arrow in a spirit of frustration. Such was the beauty and attraction
of the queens of Lord Krsna. Yet they could not disturb the transcendental
senses of the Lord. This is because the Lord is all-perfect atmarama, or self-
sufficient. He does not require anyone's extraneous help for His personal
satisfaction. Therefore, the queens could not satisfy the Lord by their
feminine attractiveness, but they satisfied Him by their sincere affection
and service. Only by unalloyed transcendental loving service could they
satisfy the Lord, and the Lord was pleased to treat them as wives in
reciprocation. Thus being satisfied by their unalloyed service only, the
Lord reciprocated the service just like a devout husband. Otherwise He
had no business to become the husband of so many wives. He is the
husband of everyone, but to one who accepts Him as such, He reciprocates.
This unalloyed affection for the Lord is never to be compared to mundane
lust. It is purely transcendental. And the grave dealings, which the queens
displayed in natural feminine ways, were also transcendental because the
feelings were expressed out of transcendental ecstasy. It is already explained
in the previous verse that the Lord appeared like a mundane husband, but
factually His relation with His wives was transcendental, pure and uncon-
ditioned by the modes of material nature.

TRANSLATION

The common materialistic conditioned souls speculate that the Lord is
one of them. Out of their ignorance they think that the Lord is affected
by matter, although He is unattached.

PURPORT

The word abudhah is significant here. Due to ignorance only, the foolish
mundane wranglers misunderstand the Supreme Lord and spread their
foolish imaginations amongst innocent persons by propaganda. The Su-
preme Lord Sri Krsna is the original primeval Personality of Godhead, and
when He was personally present before the eyes of everyone, He displayed
full-fledged divine potency in every field of activities. As we have already
explained in the first verse of Srimad-Bhagavatam, He is completely
independent to act however He likes, but all His actions are full of bliss,
knowledge and eternity. Only the foolish mundaners misunderstand Him,
unaware of His eternal form of knowledge and bliss which is confirmed
in the Bhagavad-gita and Upanisads. His different potencies work in a
perfect plan of natural sequence, and doing everything by the agency of
His different potencies, He remains eternally the supreme independent.


--- Page 225 ---
602 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 11
When He descends on the material world by His causeless mercy to
different living beings, He does so by His own potency, He is not subject
to any condition of the material modes of nature, and He descends as He
is originally. The mental speculators misunderstand Him as the Supreme
Person, and they consider His impersonal features as inexplicable Brahman
tobe all. Such a conception is also the product of conditioned life, because
they cannot go beyond their own personal capacity. Therefore, one who
considers the Lord on the level of one’s limited potency is only a common
man. Such a man cannot be convinced that the Personality of Godhead is
always unaffected by the modes of material nature. He cannot understand
that the sun is always unaffected by infectious matter. The mental
speculators compare everything from the standpoint of experimental
knowledge of their own selves. Thus when the Lord is found to act like an
ordinary person in matrimonial bondage, they consider Him to be like one
of them, without considering that the Lord can marry at once sixteen
thousand wives or more. Due to a poor fund of knowledge they accept
one side of the picture while disbelieving the other. This means-that due
to ignorance only they always think of Lord Krsna as like themselves and
make their own conclusions, which are absurd and unauthentic from the
version of the Srimad-Bhagavatam.

--- Page 226 ---
Text 38] Lord Krsna’s Entrance in Dvaraka 603
Similarly, the devotees who have taken shelter of the Lord do not become
influenced by the material qualities.
PURPORT

In the Vedas and Vedic literatures (Sruti and Smrti) it 15 affirmed that
in the Divinity there is nothing material. He is transcendental (nirguna)
only, the supreme cognizant. Hari, or the Personality of Godhead, is the
Supreme transcendental Person situated beyond the range of material
affection. These statements are also confirmed even by Acarya Sankara.
One may argue that His relation with the goddesses of fortune may be
transcendental, but what about His relation with the Yadu dynasty, being
born in that family, or His killing the nonbelievers like Jarasandha and
other asuras directly in contact with the modes of material nature. The
answer is that the Divinity of the Personality of Godhead is never in
contact with the qualities of material nature in any circumstances. Actually
He is in contact with such qualities because He is the ultimate source of
everything, yet He is above the actions of such qualities. He is known,
therefore, as Yogesvara, or the master of mystic power, or in other words
the all-powerful. Even His learned devotees are not affected by the influ-
ence of the material modes. The great six Gosvamis of Vrndavana all came
from greatly rich and aristocratic families, but when they adopted the life
of mendicants at Vindavana, superficially they appeared to be in wretched
conditions of life, but factually they were the richest of all in spiritual
values. Such mahabhagavatas, or first-grade devotees, although moving
amongst men, are not contaminated by honor or insult, hunger or satisfac-
tion, by sleep or wakefulness, which are all resultant actions of the three
modes of material nature. Similarly, some of them are engaged in worldly
dealings, yet are unaffected. Unless these neutralities of life are there, one
cannot be considered situated in transcendence. The Divinity and His
associates are on the same transcendental plane, and their glories are
always sanctified by the action of yogamaya, or the internal potency of
the Lord. The devotees of the Lord are always transcendental, even if
they are sometimes found to have fallen in their behavior. The Lord
emphatically declares in the Bhagavad-gita (Bg. 9.30) that even if an
unalloyed devotee is found to be fallen due to a previous material contami-
nation, he is nevertheless to be accepted as fully transcendental because of
his being engaged cent percent in the devotional service of the Lord. The
Lord protects him always because of his rendering service unto Him, and
the fallen conditions are to be considered accidental and temporary. They
will vanish in no time.

TRANSLATION
The simple and delicate women truly thought that the Lord Sri Krsna,
their beloved husband, followed them and was dominated by them. They
were unaware of the extent of the glories of their husband, as the atheists
are unaware of Him as the supreme controller.
PURPORT
Even the transcendental wives of Lord Sri Krsna did not know com-
pletely the unfathomable glories of the Lord. This ignorance is not mun-
dane because there is some action of the internal potency of the Lord in
the exchange of feelings between Him and His eternal associates. The Lord
exchanges transcendental relations in five ways, as proprietor, master,
friend, son and lover, and in each of these pastimes He plays fully by the
potency of yogamaya, the internal potency. He plays exactly like an equal
friend with the cowherd boys or even with friends like Arjuna. He plays
exactly like a son in the presence of Yasodamata, He plays exactly like a
lover in the presence of the cowherd damsels, and He plays
exactly like a husband in the presence of the queens of Dvaraka. Such
devotees of the Lord never think of the Lord as the Supreme, but think of
Him exactly as a common friend, a pet son or a lover or husband very
much dear to heart and soul. That is the relation between the Lord and
His transcendental devotees, who act as His associates in the spiritual sky


--- Page 228 ---
Text 39] Lord Krsna’s Entrance in Dvaraka 605
where there are innumerable Vaikuntha planets. When the Lord descends,
He does so along with His entourage to display a complete picture of the
transcendental world where pure love and devotion for the Lord prevail
without any mundane tinge of lording it over the creation of the Lord.
Such devotees of the Lord are all liberated souls, perfect representations
of the marginal or internal potency in complete negation of the influence
of the external potency. The wives of Lord Krsna were made to forget the
immeasurable glories of the Lord by the internal potency so that there
might not be any flaw of exchange, and they took it for granted that the
Lord was a henpecked husband, always following them in lonely places. In
other words, even the personal associates of the Lord do not know Him
perfectly well, so what do the thesis writers or mental speculators know
about the transcendental glories of the Lord? The mental speculators
present different theses as to His becoming the causes of the creation, the
ingredients of the creation or the material and efficient cause of the
creation, etc., but all this is but partial knowledge about the Lord.
Factually they are as ignorant as the common man. The Lord can be known
by the mercy of the Lord only, and by no other means. But since the
dealings of the Lord with His wives are based on pure transcendental love
and devotion, the wives are all on the transcendental plane without
material contamination.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the First Canto, Eleventh
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “Lord Krsna’s Entrance into
Dvaraka.”

Lord’s departure for Dvaraka were discussed. His arrival at Dvaraka and
residing with the sixteen thousand queens, etc., were narrated. They were
absorbed in hearing such descriptions, but now they wanted to turn to the
original topic, and thus the inquiry was made by Saunaka Rsi. So the sub-

How was the great Emperor Pariksit, who was a highly intelligent and

PURPORT

The King of Hastinapura (now Delhi) used to be the Emperor of the
world, at least till the time of the son of Emperor Pariksit. Maharaja
Pariksit was saved by the Lord in the womb of his mother, so he could
certainly be saved from an untimely death due to the ill will of the son of
a brahmana. Because the age of Kali began to act just after the assumption
of power by Maharaja Pariksit, the first sign of misgivings was ex-
hibited in the cursing of a greatly intelligent and devoted king like


--- Page 231 ---
Text 3] Birth of Emperor Pariksit 609
Maharaja Pariksit. The king is the protector of the helpless citizens,
and their welfare, peace and prosperity depend on him. Unfortunately,
by the instigation of the fallen age of Kali, an unfortunate brahmana’s
son was employed to condemn the innocent Maharaja Pariksit, and so the
King had to prepare himself for death within seven days. Maharaja
Pariksit is especially famous as one whois protected by Visnu, and whenhe
was unduly cursed by a brahmana’s son, he could have invoked the mercy
of the Lord to save him, but he did not want to because he was a pure
devotee. A pure devotee never asks the Lord for any undue favor. Maharaja
Pariksit knew that the curse of the brahmana’s son upon him was un-
justified, as everyone else knew, but he did not want to counteract it
because he knew also that the age of Kali had begun and that the first
symptom of the age, namely degradation of the highly talented brahmana
community, had also begun. He did not want to interfere with the cur-
rent of the time, but he prepared himself to meet death very cheerfully
and very properly. Being fortunate, he got at least seven days to prepare
himself to meet death, and so he properly utilized the time in the associa-
tion of Sukadeva Gosvami, the great saint and devotee of the Lord.

610 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 12
PURPORT

Sukadeva Gosvami imparted transcendental knowledge to Maharaja
Pariksit during the remaining seven days of his life, and Maharaja Pariksit
heard him properly, just like an ardent student, and the effect of such a
bona fide hearing and chanting of Srimad-Bhagavatam was equally shared
by both the hearer and the chanter. Both of them were benefited. Out
of the nine different transcendental means of devotional service of the
Lord prescribed in the Bhagavatam, either all of them, or some of them or
even one of them, are equally beneficial if properly discharged. Maharaja
Pariksit and Sukadeva Gosvami were serious performers of the first two
important items, namely the process of chanting and the process of hearing,
and therefore both of them were successful in their laudable attempt.
Transcendental realization is attained by such serious hearing and chanting
and not otherwise. There is a type of spiritual master and disciple much
advertised in this age of Kali. It is said that the master injects spiritual
force into the disciple by an electrical current generated by the master, and
the disciple begins to feel the shock. He becomes unconscious, and the
master weeps for his exhausting his store of so-called spiritual assets. Such
bogus advertisement is going on in this age, and the poor common man is
becoming the victim of such advertisement. We do not find such folk tales
in the dealings of Sukadeva Gosvimi and his great disciple Maharaja
Pariksit. The sage recited Srimad-Bhagavatam in devotion, and the great
King heard him properly. The King did not feel any shock of electrical
current from the master, nor did he become unconscious while receiving
knowledge from the master. One should not, therefore, become a victim
of these unauthorized advertisements made by some bogus representative
of Vedic knowledge. The sages of Naimisaranya were very respectful in
hearing about Maharaja Pariksit because of his receiving knowledge from
Sukadeva Gosvami by means of ardent hearing. Ardent hearing from the
bona fide master is the only way to receive transcendental knowledge, and
there is no need for medical performances or occult mysticism for miracu-
lous effects. The process is simple, but only the sincere party can achieve
the desired result.

Sri Suita Gosvami said: Emperor Yudhisthira administered generously
to everyone during his reign. He was exactly like his father. He had no
personal ambition and was freed from all sorts of sense gratification be-
cause of his continuous service unto the lotus feet of the Lord Sri Krsna.
PURPORT
As mentioned in our introduction, “There is a need for the science of
Krsna in human society for all the suffering humanity of the world, and
we simply request the leading personalities of all nations to take to the
science of Krsna for their own good, for the good of society, and for the
good of all the people of the world.” So it is confirmed herein by the
example of Maharaja Yudhisthira, the personality of goodness. In India
the people hanker after Rama-rajya because the Personality of Godhead
was the ideal king and all other kings or emperors in India controlled the
destiny of the world for the prosperity of every living being who took
birth on the earth. Herein the word prajah is significant. The etymological
import of the word is “that which is born.” On the earth there are many
species of life, from the aquatics up to the perfect human beings, and all
are known as prajas. Lord Brahma, the creator of this particular universe,
is known as the prajapati because he is the grandfather of all who have
taken birth. Thus praja is used in a broader sense than it is now used. The
king represents all living beings, the aquatics, plants, trees, the reptiles, the
birds, the animals and man. Every one of them is a part and parcel of the
Supreme Lord (Bg. 14.4), and the king, being the representative of the
Supreme Lord, is duty-bound to give proper protection to every one of


--- Page 234 ---
612 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 12
them. This is not the case with the presidents and dictators of this de-
moralized system of administration where the lower animals are given no
protection while the higher animals are given so-called protection. But
this is a great science which can be learned only by one who knows the
science of Krsna. By knowing the science of Krsna, one can become the
most perfect man in the world, and unless one has knowledge in this
science, all qualifications and doctorate diplomas acquired by academic
education are spoiled and useless. Maharaja Yudhisthira knew this science
of Krsna very well, for it is stated here that by continuous cultivation of
this science, or by continuous devotional service to Lord Krsna, he ac-
quired the qualification of administering the state. The father is sometimes
seemingly cruel to the son, but that does not mean that the father has lost
the qualification to be a father. A father is always a father because he has
always the good of the son at heart. The father wants every one of his sons
to become a better man than himself. Therefore, a king like Maharaja
Yudhisthira, who is the personality of goodness, wanted everyone under
his administration, especially human beings who have better developed
consciousness, to become devotees of Lord Krsna so that everyone can
become free from the trifles of material existence. His motto of adminis-
tration was all good for the citizens, for as personified goodness, he knew
perfectly well what is actually good for them. He conducted the adminis-
tration on that principle, and not on the raksasi or demonic principle of
sense gratification. As an ideal king, he had no personal ambition, and
there was no place for sense gratification because all his senses at all times
were engaged in the loving service of the Supreme Lord, which includes
the partial service to the living beings who form the parts and parcels of the
complete whole. Those who are busy rendering service to the parts and
parcels, leaving aside the whole, only spoil time and energy, as one does
when watering the leaves of a tree without watering the root. If water is
poured on the root, the leaves are enlivened perfectly and automatically,
but if water is poured on the leaves only, the whole energy is spoiled.
Maharaja Yudhisthira, therefore, was constantly engaged in the service of
the Lord, and thus the parts and parcels of the Lord, the living beings under
his careful administration, were perfectly attended with all comforts in
this life and all progress in the next. That is the way of perfect management
of state administration.

TRANSLATION
News even reached the celestial planets about Maharaja Yudhisthira’s
worldly possessions, the sacrifices by which he would attain a better
destination, his queen, his stalwart brothers, his extensive land, his
sovereignty over the planet earth, and his fame, etc.
PURPORT
Only a rich and great man’s name and fame are known all over the
world, and the name and fame of Maharaja Yudhisthira reached the
higher planets because of his good administration, worldly possessions,
glorious wife Draupadi, the strength of his brothers Bhima and Arjuna, and
his solid sovereign power over the world, known as Jambiidvipa. Here the
word loka is significant. There are different lokas or higher planets scat-
tered all over the sky, both material and spiritual. A person can reach them
by dint of his work in the present life, as stated in the Bhagavad-gita
(Bg. 9.25). No forceful entrance is allowed there. The tiny material scien-
tists and engineers who have discovered vehicles to travel over a few thou-
sand miles in outer space will not be allowed entrance. That is not the way
to reach the better planets. One must qualify himself to enter into such
happy planets by sacrifice and service. Those who are sinful in every step
of life can expect only to be degraded into animal life to suffer more and
more the pangs of material existence. and this is also stated in the
Bhagavad-gita (Bg. 16.19). Maharaja Yudhisthira’s good sacrifices and
qualifications were so lofty and virtuous that even the residents of the
higher celestial planets were already prepared to receive him as one of
them.

TRANSLATION
0 brahmanas, the opulence of the King was sc enchanting that the
denizens of heaven aspired for it. But because he was absorbed in the
service of the Lord, nothing could satisfy him except the Lord’s service.
PURPORT
There are two things in the world which can satisfy living beings. When
one is materially engrossed, he is satisfied only by sense gratification, but
when one is liberated from the conditions of the material modes, he is
satisfied only by rendering loving service for the satisfaction of the Lord.
This means that the living being is constitutionally a servitor, and not one
who is served. Being illusioned by the conditions of the external energy,
one falsely thinks himself to be the served, but actually he is not served;
he is servant of the senses like lust, desire, anger, avarice, pride, madness
and intolerance. When one is in his proper senses by attainment of spiritual
knowledge, he realizes that he is not the master of the material world but
is only a servant of the senses. At that time he begs for the service of the
Lord and thus becomes happy without being illusioned by so-called mate-
rial happiness. Maharaja Yudhisthira was one of the liberated souls, and
therefore for him there was no pleasure in a vast kingdom, good wife,
obedient brothers, happy subjects and prosperous world. These blessings
automatically follow for a pure devotee, even though the devotee does not
aspire for them. The example set herein is exactly suitable. It is said that
one who is hungry is never satisfied by anything other than food.
The whole material world is full of hungry living beings. The hunger is
not for good food, shelter or sense gratification. The hunger is for the
spiritual atmosphere. Due to ignorance only they think that the world is


--- Page 237 ---
Text 7] Birth of Emperor Pariksit 615
not satisfied because there is not sufficient food, shelter, defense and ob-
jects of sense gratification. This is called illusion. When the living being is
hungry for spiritual satisfaction, he is misrepresented by material hunger.
But the foolish leaders cannot see that even the people who are most
sumptuously materially satisfied are still hungry. And what is their hunger
and poverty? This hunger is actually for spiritual food, spiritual shelter.
spiritual defense and spiritual sense gratification. These can be obtained in
the association of the Supreme Spirit Lord Sri Krsna, and therefore one
who has them cannot be attracted by the so-called food, shelter, defense
and sense gratification of the material world, even if they are relished by
the denizens of the heavenly planets. Therefore, in the Bhagavad-gita it is
said by the Lord (Bg. 8.16) that even in the topmost planet of the universe,
namely the Brahmaloka, where the duration of life is multiplied by millions
of years by earth calculation, one cannot satisfy his hunger. Such hunger
can only by satisfied when the living being is situated in immortality, which
is attained in the spiritual sky far, far above the Brahmaloka, in the
association of Lord Mukunda, the Lord who awards His devotees the
transcendental pleasure of liberation.

616 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 12
PURPORT
Death generally involves remaining in trance for seven months. A living
being, according to his own action, is allowed to enter into the womb of a
mother by the vehicle of a father’s semina, and thus he develops his de-
sired body. This is the law of birth in specific bodies according to one’s
past actions. When he is awake from trance, he feels the inconvenience of
being confined within the womb, and thus he wants to come out of it and
sometimes fortunately prays to the Lord for such liberation. Maharaja
Pariksit, while in the womb of his mother, was struck by the brahmastra
released by Asvatthama, and he was feeling the burning heat. But because
he was a devotee of the Lord, the Lord at once appeared Himself within
the womb by His all-powerful energy, and the child could see that someone
else had come to save him. Even in that helpless condition, the child
Pariksit endured the unbearable temperature due to his being a great
fighter by nature. And for this reason the word virah has been used.

The Lord was enriched with four hands, earrings of molten gold and
eyes blood red with fury. As He loitered about, His club constantly en-
circled Him like a shooting star.
PURPORT
It is said in the Brahma-sarihita (Ch. ४) that the Supreme Lord Govinda
by His one plenary portion enters into the halo of the universe and dis-
tributes himself as Paramatma, or the Supersoul, not only within the heart
of every living being, but also within every atom of the material elements.
Thus the Lord is all-pervading by His inconceivable potency, and thus He
entered the womb of Uttara to save His beloved devotee Maharaja Pariksit.
In the Bhagavad-gita (Bg. 9.13) the Lord assured everyone that His devotees
are never to be vanquished. No one can kill a devotee of the Lord because
he is protected by the Lord, and no one can save a person whom the Lord
desires to kill. The Lord is all-powerful, and therefore He can both save
and kill as He likes. He became visible to His devotee Maharaja Pariksit


--- Page 240 ---
618 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 12
even in that awkward position (in the womb of his mother) in a shape just
suitable for his vision. The Lord can become bigger than thousands of
universes and can become smaller than an atom at the same time. Merciful
as He is, He becomes just suitable to the vision of the limited living being.
He is unlimited. He is not limited by any measurement of our calculation.
He can become bigger than what we can think of, and He can become
smaller than what we can conceive. But in all circumstances He is the same
all-powerful Lord. There is no difference between the thumblike Visnu in
the womb of Uttara and the full-fledged Narayana in the Vaikuntha-dhama,
the kingdom of Godhead. He accepts the form of arca-vigraha (worshipable
Deity) just to accept service from His different incapable devotees. By the
mercy of the arca-vigraha, the form of the Lord in material elements, the
devotees who are in the material world can easily approach the Lord,
although He is not conceivable by the material senses. The arca-vigraha
is therefore an all-spiritual form of the Lord to he perceived by the
material devotees; such arca-vigraha of the Lord is never to be considered
material. There is no difference between matter and spirit for the Lord,
although there is a gulf of difference between the two in the case of the
conditioned living being. As for the Lord, there is nothing but spiritual
existence, and there is nothing except spiritual existence for the pure
devotee of the Lord in his intimate relation with the Lord.

While thus being observed by the child, the Supreme Lord Personality

who stretches in all directions and who is unlimited by time and space,
disappeared at once.
PURPORT
Child Pariksit was not observing a living being who is limited by time
and space. There is a gulf of difference between the Lord and the individu-
al living being. The Lord is mentioned herein as the supreme living being
unlimited by time and space. Every living being is limited by time and
space. Even though a living being is qualitatively one with the Lord, still
quantitatively there is a great difference between the Supreme Soul and
the common individual soul. In the Bhagavad-gita both the living beings
and the Supreme Being are said to be all-pervading (yena sarvam idam ta-
tam), yet thereis a difference between these two kinds of all-pervasiveness.
A common living being or soul can be all-pervading within his own limited
body, but the supreme living being is all-pervading in all space and all time.
A common living being cannot extend its influence over another common
living being by its all-pervasiveness, but the Supreme Supersoul, the
Personality of Godhead, is unlimitedly able to exert His influence over all
places and all times and over all living beings. And because He is all-
pervasive, unlimited by time and space, He can appear even within the


--- Page 242 ---
620 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 12
womb of the mother of child Pariksit. He is mentioned herein as the
protector of the righteous. Anyone who is a surrendered soul unto the
Supreme is righteous, and he is specifically protected by the Lord in all
circumstances. He is the indirect protector of the unrighteous also, for He
rectifies their sins through His external potency. The Lord is mentioned
herein as one who is dressed in the ten directions. This means dressed with
garments on ten sides, up and down. He is present everywhere and can
appear and disappear at His will from everywhere and anywhere. His
disappearance from the sight of the child Pariksit does not mean that He
appeared on the spot from any other place. He was present there, and even
after His disappearance He was there, although invisible to the eyes of the
child. This material covering of the effulgent firmament is also something
like a womb of the mother nature, and we are all put into the womb by
the Lord, the father of all living beings. He is present everywhere, even in
this material womb of mother Durga, and amongst those who deserve to
see the Lord.

PURPORT

Astronomical calculations of stellar influences upon a living being are
not suppositions but are factual, as confirmed in Srimad-Bhagavatam.
Every living being is controlled by the laws of nature at every minute, just
as a citizen is controlled by the influence of the state. The state laws are
grossly observed, but the laws of material nature, being subtle to our gross
understanding, cannot be experienced grossly. As stated in the Bhagavad-
gita (Bg. 3.9), every action of life produces another reaction, which is
binding upon us, and only those who are acting on behalf of Yajiia (ছাড়া)
are not bound by reactions. Our actions are judged by the higher authori-
ties, the agents of the Lord, and thus we are awarded bodies according to
our activities. The law of nature is so subtle that every part of our body
is influenced by the respective stars, and a living being obtains his working
body to fulfill his terms of imprisonment by the manipulation of such
astronomical influence. A man’s destiny is therefore ascertained by the
birthtime constellation of stars, and a factual horoscope is made by a
learned astrologer. It is a great science, and misuse of a science does not
make it useless. Maharaja Pariksit or even the Personality of Godhead
appear in certain constellations of good stars, and thus the influence is
exerted upon the body thus born at an auspicious moment. The most
auspicious constellation of stars takes place during the appearance of the
Lord on this material world, and it is specifically called jayanti and is not
to be abused for any other purposes. Maharaja Pariksit was not only a
great ksatriya emperor, but also a great devotee of the Lord. Thus he
cannot take his birth at any inauspicious moment. As a proper place and
time is selected to receive a respectable personage, so also to receive a
personality like Maharaja Pariksit, who is especially cared for by the
Supreme Lord, a suitable moment is chosen when all good stars assembled
together to exert their influence upon the King. Thus he took his birth
just to be known as the great hero of Srimad-Bhagavatam. This suitable
arrangement of astral influences is never a creation of man’s will, but is
the arrangement of the superior management of the agency of the Supreme
Lord. Of course, the arrangement is made according to the good or bad
deeds of the living being. Herein lies the importance of pious acts per-
formed by the living being. By pious acts only can one be allowed to get
good wealth, good education and beautiful features. The sariiskdaras of the
school of sandtana-dharma (man’s eternal engagement) are highly suitable
for creating an atmosphere for taking advantage of good stellar influences,


--- Page 244 ---
622 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 12
and, therefore, Garbhadhana-sariskaram, or the first seedling purificatory
process prescribed for the higher castes, is the beginning of all pious acts to
receive a good, pious and intelligent class of men in human society. There
will be peace and prosperity in the world due to good and sane population
only; there is hell and disturbance only because of the unwanted insane
populace addicted to sex indulgence.

King Yudhisthira, who was very satisfied with the birth of Maharaja
Pariksit, had the purificatory process of birth performed. Learned brih-
manas, headed by Dhaumya and Krpa, recited auspicious hymns.
PURPORT
There is a need for a good and intelligent class of brahmanas who are
expert in performing the purificatory processes prescribed in the system
of varnasrama-dharma. Unless such purificatory processes are performed,
there is no possibility of good population, and in the age of Kali the
population all over the world is of sudra quality or lower for want of this
purificatory process. It is not possible, however, to revive the Vedic process
of purification in this age for want of proper facilities and good brahmanas,
but there is the Paiicaratrika system also recommended for this age. The


--- Page 245 ---
Text 13] Birth of Emperor Pariksit 623
[0270007৫710 system acts on the $iidra class of men, supposedly the popula-
tion of the Kali-yuga, and it is the prescribed purificatory process suitable
to the age and time. Such a purificatory process is allowed only for
spiritual upliftment and not for any other purpose. Spiritual upliftment is
never conditioned by higher or lower parentage.

After the Garbhadhana purificatory process, there are certain other
50185100105 like Stmantonnayana, Sadhabhaksanam, etc., during the period
of pregnancy, and when the child is born the first purificatory process is
jatakarman. This was performed duly by Maharaja Yudhisthira with the help
of good and learned brahmanas like Dhaumya, the royal priest, and
Krpacarya, who was not only a priest but also a great general. Both these
learned and perfect priests assisted by other good brahmanas were em-
ployed by Maharaja Yudhisthira to perform the ceremony. Therefore all
the sariiskaras or purificatory processes are not mere formalities or social
functions only, but they are all for practical purposes and can be success-
fully performed by expert brahmanas like Dhaumya and Krpa. Such
brahmanas are not only rare but also not available in this age, and there-
fore, for the purpose of spiritual upliftment in this fallen age, the Go-
svamis prefer the purificatory processes under Paficaratrika formulas to the
Vedic rites.

Krpacarya is the son of the great Rsi Sardban and was born in the
family of Gautama. The birth is said to be accidental. By chance, the great
Rsi Sardban met Janapadi, a famous society girl of heaven, and the Rsi
Sardban discharged semina in two parts. By one part immediately a male
child and by the other part a female child were born as twins. The male
child was later on known as Krpa, and the female child was known as Krpi.
Maharaja Santanu, while engaged in chase in the jungle, picked up the
children and brought them up to the brahminical status by the proper
purificatory process. Krpacarya later on became a great general like
Dronacarya, and his sister was married to Dronacarya. Krpacarya later on
took part in the Battle of Kuruksetra and joined the party of Duryodhana.
Krpacarya helped kill Abhimanyu, the father of Maharaja Pariksit, but he
was still held in esteem by the family of the Pandavas due to his becoming
as great a brahmana as Dronacarya. When the Pandavas were sent to the
forest after being defeated in the gambling game with Duryodhana,
Dhrtariistra entrusted the Pandavas to Krpacarya for guidance. After the
end of the battle, Krpacarya again became a member of the royal assembly,
and he was called during the birth of Maharaja Pariksit for recitation of
auspicious Vedic hymns to make the ceremony successful. Maharaja
Yudhisthira, while quitting the palace for his great departure to the


--- Page 246 ---
624 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 12
Himalayas, entrusted Krpacarya with Maharaja Pariksit as his disciple, and
he left home satisfied because of Krpacarya’s taking charge of Maharaja
Pariksit. The great administrators, kings and emperors were always under
the guidance of learned brahmanas like Krpacarya and thus were able to
act properly in the discharge of political responsibilities.

TRANSLATION
Upon the birth of a son, the King, who knew how, where and when
charity should be given, gave gold, land, villages, elephants, horses and
good food grains to the brahmanas.
PURPORT

Only the brahmanas and sannyasis are authorized to accept charity from
the householders. In all the different occasions of samskaras, especially
during the time of birth, marriage and death, wealth is distributed to the
brahmanas because the brahmanas give the highest quality of service in
regards to the prime necessity of humankind. The charity was substantial
in the shape of gold, land, villages, horses, elephants and food grains, with
other materials for cooking complete foodstuff. The brahmanas were not,
therefore, poor in the actual sense of the term. On the contrary, because


--- Page 247 ---
Text 15] Birth of Emperor Pariksit 625
they possessed gold, land, villages, horses, elephants and sufficient grains,
they had nothing to earn for themselves. They would simply devote them-
selves to the well-being of the entire society.

The word tirthavit is significant because the King knew well where and
when charity has to be given. Charity is never unproductive nor blind. In
the 25705 charity was offered to persons who deserve to accept charity by
dint of spiritual enlightenment. The so-called Daridra-Narayana, a miscon-
ception of the Supreme Lord by unauthorized persons, is never to be
found in the $astras as the object of charity. Nor can a wretched poor man
receive much munificent charity in the way of horses, elephants, land and
villages. The conclusion is that the intelligent men, or the brahmanas
specifically engaged in the service of the Lord, were properly maintained
without anxiety for the needs of the body, and the King and other house-
holders gladly looked after all their comforts.

It is enjoined in the $astras that as long as a child is joined with the
mother by the navel pipe, the child is considered to be of one body with
the mother, but as soon as the pipe is cut and the child is separated from
the mother, the purificatory process of jatakarman is performed. The admin-
istrative demigods and past forefathers of the family come to see a newly
born "child, and such an occasion is specifically accepted as the proper time
for distributing wealth to the right persons productively for the spiritual
advancement of society.

PURPORT
The child Pariksit was saved by the all-powerful and all-pervasive Visnu
(Lord Krsna) for two reasons. The first reason is that the child in the
womb of his mother was spotless due to his becoming a pure devotee of the
Lord. The second reason is that the child was the only surviving male
descendant of Puru, the pious forefather of the virtuous King Maharaja
Yudhisthira. The Lord wants to continue the line of pious kings to rule
over the earth as His representatives for actual progress of a peaceful and

prosperous life. After the Battle of Kuruksetra, even up to the next genera-
tion of Maharaja Yudhisthira was annihilated, and there were none who
could generate another son in the great royal family. Maharaja Pariksit,
the son of Abhimanyu, was the only surviving heir apparent in the family,
and by the irresistible supernatural brahmastra weapon of Aévatthama, he
was forced to be annihilated. Lord Krsna is described herein as Visnu, and
this is also significant. Lord Krsna, the original Personality of Godhead,
does the work of protection and annihilation in His capacity as Visnu.
Lord Visnu is the plenary expansion of Lord Krsna. The all-pervasive
activities of the Lord are executed by Him in His Visnu feature. Child
Pariksit is described here as spotlessly white because he is an unalloyed
devotee of the Lord. Such unalloyed devotees of the Lord appear on the
earth just to execute the mission of the Lord. The Lord desires the
conditioned souls hovering in the material creation to be reclaimed to go
back home, back to Godhead, and thus He helps them by preparing the
transcendental literatures like the Vedas, by sending missionaries of saints
and sages and by deputing His representative, the spiritual master. Such
transcendental literatures, missionaries and representatives of the Lord
are spotlessly white because the contamination of the material qualities
cannot even touch them. They are always protected by the Lord when
they are threatened with annihilation. Such foolish threats are made by
the gross materialists. The brahmadstra, which was thrown by Aévatthama
at the child Pariksit, was certainly supernaturally powerful, and nothing of
the material worldcould resistits force of penetration. But the all-powerful
Lord, who is present everywhere, within and without, could counteract it
by His all-powerful potency just to save a bona fide servant of the Lord
and descendant of another devotee, Maharaja Yudhisthira, who was always
obliged by the Lord by His causeless mercy.

TRANSLATION
For this reason this child will be well known in the world as one who
is protected by the Personality of Godhead. O most fortunate one, there
is no doubt that this child will become a first-class devotee and will be
qualified with all good qualities.
PURPORT

The Lord gives protection to all living beings because He is their supreme
leader. The Vedic hymns confirm that the Lord is the Supreme Person
amongst all personalities. The difference between the two living beings is
that the one, the Personality of Godhead, provides for all other living
beings, and by knowing Him one can achieve eternal peace (Katha
Upanisad). Such protection is given by His different potencies to different
grades of living beings. But as far as His unalloyed devotees are concerned,
He gives the protection personally. Therefore, Maharaja Pariksit is pro-
tected from the very beginning of his appearance in the womb of his
mother. And because he is especially given protection by the Lord, the
indication must be concluded that the child would be a first-grade devotee
of the Lord with all good qualities. There are three grades of devotees,
namely the mahabhagavata, madhyam-adhikari and the kanisthadhikari.
Those who go to the temples of the Lord and offer worshipful respect to
the Deity without sufficient knowledge in the theological science and
therefore without any respect for the devotees of the Lord are called
materialistic devotees, or kanisthadhikari, or the third-grade devotees.
Secondly, the devotees who have developed genuine service mentality for
the Lord and thus make friendships with similar devotees only, show favor
to the neophytes and avoid the atheists are called the second-grade
devotees. But those who see everything in the Lord or everything of the
Lord and also see in everything an eternal relation of the Lord, so that
there is nothing within their purview of sight except the Lord, are called
the mahabhagavatas, or the first-grade devotees of the Lord. Such first-
grade devotees of the Lord are perfect in all respects. A devotee who may ~

Text 18] Birth of Emperor Pariksit 629
be in any of these categories is automatically qualified by all good qualities,
and thus a mahabhagavata devotee like Maharaja Pariksit is certainly per-
fectin all respects. And because Maharaja Pariksit took his birth in the fami-
ly of Maharaja Yudhisthira, he is addressed herein as the mahabhagavata,
or the greatest of the fortunates. The family in which a mahabhagavata
takes his birth is fortunate because due to the birth of a first-grade devotee,
the members of the family, past, present and future up to one hundred
generations, become liberated by the grace of the Lord, out of respect for
His beloved devotee. Therefore, the highest benefit is done to one’s family
simply by becoming an unalloyed devotee of the Lord.

The good King [ Yudhisthira] inquired: O great souls, will he become
as saintly a king, as pious in his very name and as famous and glorified in
his achievements, as others who appeared in this great royal family?
PURPORT
The forefathers of King Yudhisthira were all great saintly kings, pious
and glorified by their great achievements. They were all saints on the
royal throne. And, therefore, all the members of the state were happy,
pious, well behaved, prosperous and spiritually enlightened. Under strict


--- Page 252 ---
630 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 12
guidance of the great souls and spiritual injunctions, such great saintly
kings were trained up, and as a result the kingdom was full of saintly
persons and was a happy land of spiritual life. Maharaja Yudhisthira was
himself a prototype of his ancestors, and he desired that the next king
after him become exactly like his great forefathers. He was happy to learn
from the learned brahmanas that by astrological calculations the child
would be born a first-grade devotee of the Lord, and more confidentially
he wanted to know whether the child was going to follow in the footsteps
of his great forefathers. That is the way of the monarchical state. The
reigning king should be a pious, chivalrous devotee of the Lord and fear
personified for the upstarts. He must also leave an heir apparent equally
qualified to rule over the innocent citizens. In the modern setup of the
democratic states, the people themselves are fallen to the qualities of the
$8 0705 or less, and the government is run by their representative, who is
ignorant of the scriptural mode of administrative education. Thus the
whole atmosphere is surcharged with Sidra qualities, manifested by lust
and avarice. Such administrators quarrel every day among themselves. The
cabinet of ministers changes often due to party and group selfishness.
Everyone wants to exploit the state resources till he dies. No one retires
from political life unless forced to do so. How can such low-grade men do
good to the people? The result is corruption, intrigue and hypocrisy. They
should learn from the Srimad-Bhagavatam how ideal the administrators
must be before they can be given charge of different posts.

The learned brahmanas said: O son of Prtha, this child shall be exactly

And as for following the brahminical principles, especially in being true to
his promise, he shall be exactly like Rama, the Personality of Godhead, the
son of Maharaja Dasaratha.
PURPORT
Praja means the living being who has taken his birth in the material
world. Actually the living being has no birth and no death, but because of
his separation from the service of the Lord and due to his desire to lord it
over material nature, he is offered a suitable body to satisfy his material
desires. In doing so, one becomes conditioned by the laws of material
nature, and the material body is changed in terms of his own work. The
living entity thus transmigrates from one body to another in 8,400,000
species of life. But due to his being the part and parcel of the Lord, he
is not only maintained with all necessaries of life by the Lord, but also
is protected by the Lord and His representatives, the saintly kings. These
saintly kings give protection to all the prajas, or living beings, to live and
to fulfill their terms of imprisonment. Maharaja Pariksit was actually an
ideal saintly king because while touring his kingdom he happened to see
that a poor cow was about to be killed by the personified Kali, and he at
once took him to task as a murderer. This means that even the animals
were given protection by the saintly administrators, not from any senti-
mental point of view, but because those who have taken their birth in the
world have the right to live. All the saintly kings, beginning from the King
of the sun globe down to the King of the earth, are so inclined by the
influence of the Vedic literatures. The Vedic literatures are taught in higher
planets also, as there is reference in the Bhagavad-gita (Bg. 4.7) about the
teachings to the sun-god (Vivasvan) by the Lord, and such lessons are
transferred by disciplic succession, as it was done by the sun-god to his son
Manu, and from Manu to Maharaja Iksvaku. There are fourteen Manus in
one day of Brahmi, and the Manu referred to herein is the seventh Manu,
who is one of the Prajapatis (those who create progeny), and he is the son
of the sun-god. He is known as the Vaivasvata Manu. He had ten sons, and
Maharaja Iksvaku is one of them. Maharaja Iksvaku also learned bhakti-yoga
as taught in the Bhagavad-gita from his father, Manu, who got it from his
father, the sun-god. Later on the teaching of the Bhagavad-gita came down
by disciplic succession from Maharaja Iksvaku, but in course of time the


--- Page 254 ---
632 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 12
chain was broken by unscrupulous persons, and therefore it again had to
be taught to Arjunaon the Battlefield of Kuruksetra. So all the Vedic
literatures are current from the very beginning of creation of the material
world, and thus the Vedic literatures are known as apauruseya (not made
by man). The Vedic knowledge was spoken by the Lord and first heard by
Brahma, the first created living being within the universe.

Maharaja ITksvaku: One of the sons of Vaivasvata Manu. He had one
hundred sons. He prohibited meat eating. His son Sasada became the next
king after his death.

Manu: The Manu mentioned in this verse as the father of Iksvaku is the
seventh Manu, of the name Vaivasvata Manu, the son of sun-god Vivasvan
to whom Lord Krsna instructed the teachings of Bhagavad-gita prior to
His teaching them to Arjuna. Mankind is the descendant of Manu. This
Vaivasvata Manu had ten sons, named Iksvaku, Nabhaga, Dhrsta, Saryati,
Narisyanta, Nabhaga, Dista, Karusa, Prsadhra, and Vasuman. The Lord’s
incarnation Matsya (the gigantic fish) was advented during the beginning
of Vaivasvata Manu’s reign. He learned the principles of Bhagavad-gita
from his father Vivasvan, the sun-god, and he reinstructed the same to his
son Maharaja Iksvaku. In the beginning of the Treta-yuga the sun-god
instructed devotional service to Manu, and Manu in his turn instructed it to
Iksvaku for the welfare of the whole human society.

Lord Rama: The Supreme Personality of Godhead incarnated Himself as
Sri Rama, accepting the sonhood of His pure devotee Maharaja Dadaratha,
the King of Ayodhya. Lord Rama descended along with His plenary por-
tions, and all of them appeared as His younger brothers. In the month of
Caitra on the ninth day of the growing moon in the Treta-yuga, the Lord
appeared, as usual, to establish the principles of religion and to annihilate
the disturbing elements. When He was just a young boy, He helped the
great sage Visvamitra by killing Subahu and striking Marica, the she-demon,
who was disturbing the sages in their daily discharge of duties. The
brahmanas and ksatriyas are meant to cooperate for the welfare of the
mass of people. The brahmana sages endeavor to enlighten the people by
perfect knowledge, and the ksatriyas are meant for their protection. Lord
Ramacandra is the ideal king for maintaining and protecting the highest
culture of humanity known as brahmanya-dharma. The Lord is specifically
the protector of the cows and the brahmanas, and hence He enhances the
prosperity of the world. He rewarded the administrative demigods by
effective weapons to conquer the demons through the agency of Visvamitra.
He was present in the bow sacrifice of King Janaka, and by breaking the
invincible bow of Siva, He married Sitadevi, daughter of Maharaja Janaka.


--- Page 255 ---
Text 20] Birth of Emperor Pariksit 633
After His marriage He accepted exile in the forest fourteen years by the
order of His father, Maharaja Dasaratla. To help the administration of the
demigods, He killed fourteen thousand demons, and by the intrigues of the
demons, His wife Sitadevi was kidnapped by Ravana. He made friendship
with Sugriva, who was helped by the Lord to kill Vali, brother of
Sugriva. By the help of Lord Rama, Sugriva became the king of the
Vanaras (a race of gorillas). He built a floating bridge of stones on the
Indian Ocean and reached Lanka, the kingdom of Ravana, who kidnapped
Sita. Later on Ravana was killed by Him, and Ravana’s brother Vibhisana
was installéd on the throne of Laika. Vibhisana was one of the brothers
of Ravana, a demon, but Lord Rama made him immortal by His blessings.
On the expiry of fourteen years, after settling the affairs at Larika, He
came back to His kingdom Ayodhya by flower plane. He instructed His
brother Satrughna to attack Lavanasura, who reigned at Mathura, and the
demon was killed. He performed ten Asvamedha sacrifices, and later on
He disappeared while taking a bath in the Sarayu River. The great epic
Ramayana is the history of Lord Rama’s activities in the world, and the
authoritative Ramayana is written by the great poet Valmiki.

expand the name and fame of his family like Bharata, the son of Maharaja
Dusyanta.
PURPORT

A king becomes famous by his acts of charity, performances of yajiias,
protection of the surrendered, etc. A ksatriya king is proud to give
protection to the surrendered souls. This attitude of a king is called
Svara-bhava, or powerful to give protection in a righteous cause. In the
Bhagavad-gita the Lord instructs living beings to surrender unto Him, and
He promises all protection. The Lord is all-powerful and true to His word,
and therefore, He never fails to give protection to His different devotees.
The king, being the representative of the Lord, must possess this attitude
to give protection to the surrendered souls at all risk. Maharaja Sibi, the
King of Usinara, was an intimate friend of Maharaja Yayati, who was able
to reach the heavenly planets along with Maharaja Sibi. Maharaja Sibi was
aware of the heavenly planet where he was to be transferred after his
death, and the description of this heavenly planet is given in the Maha-
bharata (Adi, 96/6-9). Maharaja Sibi was so charitably disposed that he
wanted to give over his acquired position in the heavenly kingdom to
Yayati, but he did not accept it. He went to the heavenly planet along
with great rsis like Astaka and others. On inquiry from the 7315, Yayati
gave an account of Sibi’s pious acts when all of them were on the path
to heaven. He has become a member of the assembly of Yamaraja, who
has become his worshipful deity. As confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita,
the worshiper of the demigods goes to the planets of the demigods
(yanti deva-vrata devan); so Maharaja Sibi has become an associate of the
great Vaisnava authority Yamaraja on that particular planet. While he was
on the earth he became very famous as a protector of surrendered souls
and a donor of charities. The King of heaven once took the shape of a
pigeon hunter bird (eagle), and Agni the fire-god took the shape of a
pigeon. The pigeon, while being chased by the eagle, took shelter on the
lap of Maharaja Sibi, and the hunter eagle wanted the pigeon back from
the King. The King wanted to give it some other meat to eat and requested
the bird not to kill the pigeon. The hunter bird refused to accept the
King’s offer, but it was settled later on that the eagle would accept flesh
from the body of the King of the pigeon’s equivalent weight. The King
began to cut flesh from his body to weigh in the balance equivalent to the
weight of the pigeon, but the mystic pigeon always remained heavier. The
King then put himself on the balance to equate with the pigeon, and the


--- Page 257 ---
Text 21] Birth of Emperor Pariksit 635
demigods were pleased with him. The King of heaven and the fire-god
disclosed their identity, and the King was blessed by them. Devarsi Narada
also glorified Maharaja Sibi for his great achievements, specifically in
charity and protection. Maharaja Sibi sacrificed his own son for the
satisfaction of human beings in his kingdom. And thus child Pariksit was
to become a second Sibi in charity and protection.

Dausyanti Bharata: There are many Bharatas in history, of which
Bharata the brother of Lord Rama, Bharata the son of King Rsabha, and
Bharata the son of Maharaja Dusyanta are very famous. And all these
Bharatas are historically known to the universe. This earth planet is
known as Bharata, or Bharatavarsa, due to King Bharata the son of Rsabha,
but according to some this land is known as Bharata due to the reign of
the son of Dusyanta. So far as we are convinced, this land’s name
Bharatavarsa was established from the reign of Bharata, the son of
King Rsabha. Before him the land was known as Hlavativarsa, but just after
the coronation of Bharata, the son of Rsabha, this land is famous as
Bharatavarsa.

But despite all this, Bharata, son of Maharaja Dusyanta, was not less
important. He is the son of the famous beauty Sakuntala. Maharaja
Dusyanta fell in love with Sakuntala in the forest, and Bharata was
conceived. After that, Maharaja forgot his wife Sakuntala by the curse
of Kanvamuni, and the child Bharata was brought up in the forest by his
mother. Even in his childhood he was so powerful that he challenged the
lions and elephants in the forest and would fight with them as little chil-
dren play with cats and dogs. Because of the boy’s becoming so strong,
more than the so-called modern Tarzan, the rsis in the forest called him
Sarvadaman, or one who is able to control everyone. A full description
of Maharaja Bharata is given in the Mahabharata Adi Parva. The Pandavas,
or the Kurus, are sometimes addressed as Bharata due to being born in the
dynasty of famous Maharaja Bharata, the son of King Dusyanta.

Amongst great bowmen, this child will be as good as Arjuna. He will

PURPORT

In history there are two Arjunas. One is Karta Viryarjuna, the King of
Haihya, and the other is the grandfather of the child. Both the Arjunas are
famous for their bowmanship, and the child Pariksit is foretold to be equal
to both of them, particularly in fighting. A short description of the Pan-
dava Arjuna is given below:

Papdava Arjuna: The great hero of the Bhagavad-gita. He is the ksetraja
son of Maharaja Pandu. Queen Kunti could call for any one of the demigods,
and thus she called Indra, and Arjuna is born by him. Arjunais therefore
a plenary part of the heavenly King Indra. He was born in the month of
Phalguna (Feb.-March), and therefore he is also called Phalguni. When he
appeared as the son of 14110, his future greatness was proclaimed by air
messages, and all the important personalities from different parts of the
universe, such as the demigods, the Gandharvas, the Adityas (from the sun
globe) the Rudras, the Vasus, the Nagas and different rsis (sages) of
importance, and the Apsaras or the society girls of heaven, all attended the
ceremony. The Apsaras pleased everyone by their heavenly dances and
songs. Vasudeva, the father of Lord Krsna and the maternal uncle of
Arjuna, sent his priest representative Kasyapa to purify Arjuna by all the
prescribed sariskaras or reformatory processes. His samskara of giving a
name was performed in the presence of the rsis, residents of Satasriga.
He married four wives, Draupadi, Subhadra, Citrangada and Ulapi, from
whom he got four sons of the names Srutakirti, Abhimanyu, Babhruvahana,
and Iravan respectively.

During his student life he was entrusted to study under the great
professor Dronacarya, along with other Pandavas and the Kurus. But he
excelled everyone by his studious intensity, and Dronacirya was especially
attracted by his disciplinary affection. Dronacarya accepted him as a first-


--- Page 259 ---
Text 21] Birth of Emperor Pariksit 637
grade scholar and loved heartily to bestow upon him all the blessings of
military science. He was so ardent a student that he used to practice
bowmanship even at night, and for all these reasons Professor Dronacarya
was determined to make him the topmost bowman of the world. He
passed very brilliantly the examination in piercing the target, and
Dronacarya was very pleased. Royal families at Manipur and Tripura are
descendants of Babhruvahana. He saved Dronacarya from the attack of a
crocodile, and the Acarya, being pleased with him, rewarded him a
weapon of the name Brahmagira. Maharaja Drupada was inimical toward
Dronacarya, and thus when he attacked the Acarya, Arjuna got him arrested
and brought him before Dronacirya. He besieged a city of the name
Ahichhatra, belonging to Maharaja Drupada, and after taking it over he
gave it to Dronacarya. The confidential treatment of the weapon Brahma-
éira was explained to Arjuna, and Dronacarya was promised by Arjuna that
he would use the weapon if necessary when he (Dronacarya) personally
became an enemy of Arjuna. By this, the Acarya forecasted the future
battle of Kuruksetra, in which Dronacarya was on the opposite side.
Maharaja Drupada, although defeated by Arjuna on behalf of his professor
Dronicarya, decided to hand over his daughter Draupadi to his young
combatant, but he was disappointed when he heard the false news of
Arjuna’s death in the fire of a lac-house intrigued by Duryodhana. He
therefore arranged for Draupadi’s personal selection of a groom who could
pierce the eye of a fish hanging on the ceiling. This trick was especially
made because only Arjuna could do it, and he was successful in his desire
to hand over his equally worthy daughter to Arjuna. His brothers were at
that time living incognito under agreement with Duryodhana, and Arjuna
and his brothers attended the meeting of Draupadi’s selection in the dress
of brahmanas. When all the ksatriya kings assembled saw that a poor
brahmana had been garlanded by Draupadi for her lord, Sri Krsna dis-
closed his identity to Balarama.

He met Ulapi at Haridvar, and he was attracted by the girl belonging to
Nagaloka, and thus Iravan was born. Similarly, he met Citrangada, a
daughter of the King of Manipura, and thus Babhruvahana was born. Lord
Sri Krsna made a plan to help Arjuna to kidnap Subhadra, sister of Sri
Krsna, because Baladeva was inclined to hand her over to Duryodhana.
Yudhisthira also agreed with Sri Krsna, and thus Subhadra was taken by
force by Arjuna and then married to him. Subhadra’s son is Abhimanyu,
the father of Parilksit Maharaja, the posthumous child. He satisfied the
fire-god by setting fire to the Khandava Forest, and thus the fire-god gave
him one weapon. Indra was angry when fire was set in the Khandava


--- Page 260 ---
638 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 12
Forest, and thus Indra, assisted by all other demigods, began fighting with
Arjuna for his great challenge. They were defeated by Arjuna, and Indra-
deva returned to his heavenly kingdom. Arjuna also promised all protec-
tion to one Mayasura, and the latter presented him one valuable conchshell
celebrated as the Devadatta. Similarly, he received many other valuable
weapons from Indradeva when he was satisfied to see his chivalry.

When Maharaja Yudhisthira was disappointed in defeating the King of
Magadha, Jarasandha, it was Arjuna only who gave King Yudhisthira all
kinds of assurances, and thus Arjuna, Bhima and Lord Krsna started for
Magadha to kill Jarasandha. When he went out to bring all other kings of
the world under the subjection of the Pandavas, as was usual after the
coronation of every emperor, he conquered the country named Kelinda
and brought in subjugation King Bhagdutt. Then he travelled through
countries like Antagiri, Ulukpur, Modapur, etc., and brought under subju-
gation all the rulers.

Sometimes he underwent severe types of penances, and later on he was
rewarded by Indradeva. Lord Siva also wanted to try the strength of
Arjuna, and in the form of an aborigine, Lord Siva met him. There was a
great fight between the two, and at last Lord Siva was satisfied with him
and disclosed his identity. Arjuna prayed to the lord in all humbleness,
and the lord, being pleased with him, presented him the pasupata weapon.
He acquired many other important weapons from different demigods. He
received dapdastra from Yamaraja, 04525670 from Varuna, and antardhana-
astra from Kuvera, the treasurer of the heavenly kingdom. Indra wanted
him to come to the heavenly kingdom, the Indraloka planet beyond the
moon planet. In that planet he was cordially received by the local residents,
and he was awarded reception in the heavenly parliament of Indradeva.
Then he met Indradeva, who not only presented him with his Vajra
weapon, but also taught him the military and musical science as used in the
heavenly planet. In one sense, Indra is the real father of Arjuna, and there-
fore indirectly he wanted to entertain Arjuna with the famous society girl
of heaven, Urvasi the celebrated beauty. The society girls of heaven are
lusty, and [1988] was very eager to contact Arjuna, the strongest human
being, and she met him in his room and expressed her desires. But Arjuna
sustained his unimpeachable character by closing his eyes before Urvas
and addressing her as mother of the Kuru dynasty and placing her in the
category of his mothers Kunti, Madri and Sacidevi, wife of Indradeva.
Disappointed, Urvasi cursed Arjuna and left. In the heavenly planet he also
met the great celebrated ascetic Lomasa and prayed to him for the protec-
tion of Maharaja Yudhisthira.

When his inimical cousin Duryodhana was under the clutches of the
Gandharvas, he wanted to save him and requested the Gandharvas to
release Duryodhana, but the Gandharvas refused, and thus he fought with
them and got Duryodhana released. When all the Pandavas lived incognito,
he presented himself in the court of King Virata as a eunuch and was
employed as the musical teacher of Uttara, his future daughter-in-law, and
was known in the Virata court as the Brhannala. As Brhannala, he fought
on behalf of Uttara, the son of King Virata, and thus defeated the Kurus
in the fight incognito. His secret weapons were safely kept in the custody
of a somi tree, and he ordered Uttara to get them back. His identity and
his brothers’ identity were later on disclosed to Uttara. Dronacarya was
informed of Arjuna’s presence in the fight of the Kurus and the Viratas.
Later, on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra, Arjuna killed many great generals
like Karna and others. After the Battle of Kuruksetra, he punished
Asvatthama, who killed all the five sons of Draupadi. Then all the brothers
went to Bhismadeva.

It is due to Arjuna only that the great philosophical discourses of the
Bhagavad-gita were again spoken by the Lord on the Battlefield of
Kuruksetra. His wonderful acts on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra are vividly
described in the Mahabharata. Arjuna was, however, defeated by his son
Babhruvahana at Manipura and fell unconscious when 01001 saved him. After
the disappearance of Lord Krsna, the message was brought by him to
Maharaja Yudhisthira. Again, he visited Dvaraka, and all the widow wives
of Lord Krsna lamented before him. He took them all in the presence of
Vasudeva and pacified all of them. Later on, when Vasudeva passed away,
he performed his funeral ceremony in the absence of Krsna. While Arjuna
was taking all the wives of Krsna to Indraprastha, he was attacked on the
way, and he could not protect the ladies in his custody. At last, advised by
Vyasadeva, all the brothers headed for Mahaprasthan. On the way, at the
request of his brother, he gave up all important weapons as useless, and he
dropped them all in the water.

This child will be as strong as a lion, and as worthy a shelter as the
Himalayan mountains. He will be forbearing like the earth, and as tolerant
as his parents.
PURPORT
One is compared to thelion when oneis very strong in chasing an enemy.
One should be a lamb at home and a lion in the chase. The lion never fails
in the chase of an animal; similarly, the head of the state should never fail
in chasing an enemy. The Himalayan mountains are famous for all richness.
There are innumerable caves to live in, numberless trees of good fruits to
eat, good springs to drink water from and profuse drugs and minerals to
cure diseases. Any man who is not materially prosperous can take shelter
of these great mountains, and he will be provided with everything required.
Both the materialist and the spiritualist can take advantage of the great
shelter of the Himalayas. On the surface of the earth there are so many
disturbances caused by the inhabitants. In the modern age the people have
begun to detonate atomic weapons on the surface of the earth, and still
the earth is forbearing to the inhabitants, like a mother excuses a little
child. Similarly, parents are always tolerant to children for all sorts of
mischievous acts. An ideal king may be possessed of all these good qualities,
and the child Pariksit is foretold to have all these qualities in perfection.

TRANSLATION
This child will be like his grandfather Yudhisthira or Brahma in
equanimity of mind. He will be murnificent like the lord of the Kailasa Hill,
Siva. And he will be the resort of everyone, like the Supreme Personality
of Godhead Narayana who is even the shelter of the goddess of fortune.
PURPORT

Mental equanimity refers both to Maharaja Yudhisthira and Brahma,
the grandfather of all living beings. According to Sridhara Svami, the
grandfather referred to is Brahma, but according to Visvanatha Cakravarti,
the grandfather is Maharaja Yudhisthira himself. But in both the cases the
comparison is equally good because both of them are recognized repre-
sentatives of the Supreme Lord, and thus both of them have to maintain
mental equanimity, being engaged in welfare work for the living being. Any
responsible executive agent at the top of administration has to tolerate
different types of onslaughts from the very persons for whom he works.
Brahmaji was criticized even by the gopis, the highest perfectional devotees
of the Lord. The gopis were not satisfied with the work of Brahmaji
because Lord Brahma, as creator of this particular universe, created eyelids
which obstructed their seeing Lord Krsna. They could not tolerate a
moment’s blinking of the eyes, for it kept them from seeing their beloved
Lord Krsna. So what to speak of others, who are very naturally critical of
every action of a responsible man? Similarly, Maharaja Yudhisthira had to
cross over many difficult situations created by his enemies, and he proved
to be the most perfect maintainer of mental equanimity in all critical
circumstances. Therefore the example of both grandfathers for maintaining
equanimity of mind is quite fitting.

Lord Siva is a celebrated demigod who awards gifts to beggars. His name
is, therefore, Asutosa, or one who is pleased very easily. He is also called
the Bhutanatha, or the lord of the common folk who are mainly attached
to him because of his munificent gifts, even without consideration of the
after effects. Ravana was very attached to Lord Siva, and by easily pleasing


--- Page 264 ---
642 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 12
him, Ravana became so powerful that he wanted to challenge the authority
of Lord Rama. Of course, Ravana was never helped by Lord Siva when he
fought with Rama, the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the Lord of
Lord Siva. To Bhaumasura, Lord Siva awarded a benediction which is not
only awkward but also disturbing. Bhaumasura became empowered, by the
grace of Lord Siva, to vanish anyone’s head simply by touching it.
Although this was awarded by Lord Siva, the cunning fellow wanted to
make an experiment of the power by touching the head of Lord Siva. Thus
the lord had to take shelter of Visnu to save himself from trouble, and
the Lord Visnu, by His illusory potency, asked the Bhaumasura to make an
experiment with his own head, and the fellow did it and was finished
himself, and so the world was saved from all sorts of trouble by such a
cunning beggar of the demigods. But the excellent point is that Lord Siva
never denies anyone any sort of gift. He is therefore the most generous,
although sometimes some kind of mistake is made.

Rama means the goddess of fortune. And her shelter is Lord Visnu. Lord
Visnu is the maintainer of all living beings. There are innumerable living
beings, not only on the surface of this planet but also in all other hundreds
of thousands of planets, and all of them are provided with all necessities
of life for the progressive march towards the end of self-realization, but on
the path of sense gratification they are put into difficulty by the agency of
maya, the illusory energy, and so travel the path of a false plan of economic
development. Such economic development is never successful because it is
illusory. These men are always after the mercy of the illusory goddess of
fortune, but they do not know that the goddess of fortune can live only
under the protection of Visnu. Without Visnu, the goddess of fortune is an
illusion. We should therefore seek the protection of Visnu instead of
directly seeking the protection of the goddess of fortune. Only Visnu and
the devotees of Visnu can give protection to all, and because Maharaja
Pariksit was himself protected by Visnu, it was quite possible for him to
give complete protection to all who wanted to live under his rule.

This child will almost be as good as Lord Sri Krsna by following in His

And in religion he will be like Maharaja Yayati.
PURPORT

The last instruction of Lord Sri Krsna in the Bhagavad-gita is that one
should give up everything and should follow in the footsteps of the Lord
alone. Less intelligent persons do not agree to this great instruction of the
Lord, as ill luck would have it, but one who is actually intelligent catches
up this sublime instruction and is immensely benefited. Foolish people
do not know that association is the cause of acquiring qualities. Associa-
tion with fire makes an object hot, even in the material sense. Therefore,
association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead makes one qualified
like the Lord. As we have discussed previously, one can achieve seventy-
eight percent of the godly qualities by the Lord’s intimate association. To
follow the instructions of the Lord is to associate with the Lord. The
Lord is not a material object whose presence one has to feel for such
association. The Lord is present everywhere and at all times. It is quite
possible to have His association simply by following His instruction because
the Lord and His instruction and the Lord and Hisname, fame, attributes
and paraphernalia, are all identical with Him, being absolute knowledge.
Maharaja Pariksit associated with the Lord even from the womb of his
mother up to the last day of his valuable life, and thus he acquired all the
essential good qualities of the Lord in all perfection.

Rantideva: An ancient king prior to the Mahabharata period, referred to
by Narada Muni while instructing Safijaya as mentioned in Mahabharata
(Dronaparva 67 Ch). He was a great king liberal for hospitality and
distribution of foodstuff. Even Lord Sri Krsna praised his acts of charity
and hospitality. He was blessed by the great Vasistha Muni for supplying
him cold water, and thus he achieved the heavenly planet. He used to
supply fruits, roots and leaves to the rsis, and thus he was blessed by them
by fulfilling his desires. Although a ksatriya by birth, he never ate flesh in
his life. He was especially hospitable to Vasistha Muni, and by his blessings


--- Page 266 ---
644 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 12
only he attained the higher planetary residence. He is one of those pious
kings whose names are remembered in the morning and evening.

Yayati: The great emperor of the world and the original forefather of all
great nations of the world who belong to the Aryan and Indo-European
stock. He is the son of Maharaja Nahusa, and he became the emperor of
the world due to his elder brother’s becoming a great and liberated saintly
mystic. He ruled over the world for several thousands of years and per-
formed many sacrifices and pious activities recorded in history, although
his early youth was very lustful and full of romantic stories. He fell in love
with Devayani, the most beloved daughter of Sukricarya. Devayani
wished to marry him, but at first he refused to accept her because of her
being a daughter of a brahmana. According to $astras, a brahmana could
marry the daughter of a brahmana. They were very much cautious about
varna-saitkara population in the world. dukracirya ammended this law of
forbidden marriage and induced Emperor Yayati to accept Devayani.
Devayani had a girl friend named Sarmistha, who also fell in love with the
emperor and thus went with her friend Devayani. Sukricirya forbade
Emperor Yayiti to call Sarmistha into his bedroom, but Yayiti could not
strictly follow his instruction. He secretly married Sarmistha also and begot
sons by her. When this was known by Devayani, she went to her father and
lodged a complaint. Yayati was much attached to Devayani, and when he
went to his father-in-law’s place to call her, Sukracarya was angry with
him and cursed him to become impotent. Yayati begged his father-in-law
to withdraw his curse, but the sage asked Yayati to ask youthfulness from
his sons and let them become old as the condition of his becoming potent.
He had five sons, two from Devayani and three from Sarmistha. From his
five sons, namely 1) Yadu, 2) Turvasu, 3) Druhyu, 4) Anu, and 5) Piru,
five famous dynasties, namely 1) the Yadu dynasty, 2) the Yavana (Turk)
dynasty, 3) the Bhoja dynasty, 4) the Mleccha dynasty (Greek), and 5)
the Paurava dynasty, all emanated to spread all over the world. He reached
the heavenly planets by dint of his pious acts, but he fell down from there
because of his self-advertisement and criticizing other great souls. After
his fall, his daughter and grandson bestowed upon him their accumulated
virtues, and by the help of his grandson and friend Sibi, he was again
promoted to the heavenly kingdom, becoming one of the assembly
members of Yamaraja, with whom he is staying as a devotee. He performed
more than one thousand different sacrifices, gave in charity very liberally
and was a very influential king. His majestical power was felt all over the
world. His youngest son agreed to award him his youthfulness when he
was troubled with lustful desires, even for one thousand years. Finally he


--- Page 267 ---
Text 25] Birth of Emperor Pariksit 645
became detached from worldly life and returned the youthfulness again to
his son 010. He wanted to hand over the kingdom to Puru, but his
noblemen and the subjects did not agree. But when he explained to his
subjects the greatness of Piru, they agreed to accept Puru as the King, and
thus Emperor Yayati retired from family life and left home for the forest.

PURPORT
Bali Maharaja: One of the twelve authorities in devotional service of the
Lord. Bali Maharaja is a great authority in devotional service because he
sacrificed everything to please the Lord and relinquished the connection
of his so-called spiritual master who obstructed him on the path of
risking everything for the service of the Lord. The highest perfection of
religious life is to attain to the stage of unqualified devotional service of
the Lord without any cause or without being obstructed by any kind of
worldly obligation. Bali Maharaja was determined to give up everything
for the satisfaction of the Lord, and he did not care for any obstruction
whatsoever. He is the grandson of Prahlada Maharaja, another authority
in devotional service of the Lord. Bali Maharaja and the history of his

dealings with Visnu Vamanadeva are described in the Eighth Canto of
Srimad-Bhagavatam (Chapters 11 to 24).

Prahlada Maharaja: A perfect devotee of Lord Krsna (Visnu). His
father, Hiranyakasipu, chastised him severely when he was only five years
old for his becoming an unalloyed devotee of the Lord. He is the first son
of Hiranyakasipu, and his mother’s name was Kayadhu. Prahlada Maharaja
was an authority in the devotional service of the Lord because he got his
father killed by Lord Nrsimmhadeva, setting the example that even a father
should be removed from the path of devotional service if such a father
happens to be an obstacle. He had four sons, and the eldest son, Virocana,
is the father of Bali Maharaja, mentioned above. The history of Prahlada
Maharaja's activities is described in the Seventh Canto of Srimad-
Bhagavatam.

The wisest man in the world is a devotee of the Lord. The sages are
called the wise men, and there are different types of wise men for different
branches of knowledge. Unless, therefore, the king or the head of the state
is the wisest man, he cannot control all types of wise men in the state. In


--- Page 269 ---
Text 27] Birth of Emperor Pariksit 647
the line of royal succession in the family of Maharaja Yudhisthira, all the
kings, without exception, were the wisest men of their times, and so also
it is foretold about Maharaja Pariksit and his son Maharaja Janamejaya
who was yet to be born. Such wise kings can become chastisers of upstarts
and uprooters of Kali, or quarrelsome elements. As it will be clear in the
chapters ahead, Maharaja Pariksit wanted to kill the personified Kali who
was attempting to kill a cow, the emblem of peace and religion. The
symptoms of Kali are 1) wine, 2) women, 3) gambling and 4) slaughter-
houses. Wise rulers of all states should take lessons from Maharaja Pariksit
in how to maintain peace and morality by subduing the upstarts and
quarrelsome people who indulge in wine, illicit connection with women,
gambling and meat-eatingsupplied by regularly maintained slaughterhouses.
In this age of Kali, regular license is issued for maintaining all of these
different departments of quarrel. So how can they expect peace and
morality in the state? The state fathers, therefore, must follow the prin-
ciples of becoming wiser by devotion to the Lord, by chastising the breaker
of discipline and by uprooting the symptoms of quarrel, as mentioned
above. If we want blazing fire, we must use dry fuel. Blazing fire and moist
fuel go ill together. Peace and morality can prosper only by the principles
of Maharaja Pariksit and his followers.

material attachment and surrender unto the Personality of Godhead,
taking shelter of Him.
PURPORT

Material attachment and taking shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord go
ill together. Material attachment means ignorance of transcendental hap-
piness under the shelter of the Lord. Devotional service of the Lord,
while existing in the material world, is a way to practice one’s transcenden-
tal relation with the Lord, and when it is matured, one gets completely free
from all material attachment and becomes competent to go back home,
back to Godhead. Maharaja Pariksit, being especially attached to the Lord
from the beginning of his body in the womb of his mother, was continually
under the shelter of the Lord, and the so-called warning of his death
within seven days from the date of curse by the brahmana’s son became a
boon to him to prepare himself to go back home, back to Godhead. Since
he was always protected by the Lord, he could have avoided the effect of
such a curse by the grace of the Lord, but he did not take such undue
advantage for nothing. Rather, he made the best use of a bad bargain, and
for seven days continually he heard Srimad-Bhagavatam from the right
source, and thus he got shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord by that
opportunity.

Text 29] Birth of Emperor Pariksit 649
PURPORT

Material knowledge means ignorance of the knowledge of one’s own
self. Philosophy means to seek after the right knowledge of one’s own self,
or the knowledge of self-realization. Without self-realization, philosophy
is dry speculation or a waste of time and energy. Srimad-Bhagavatam
gives the right knowledge of one’s own self, and by hearing Srimad-
Bhagavatam one can get free from material attachment and enter into the
kingdom of fearlessness. This material world is fearfulness. Its prisoners
are always fearful as within a prison house. In the prison house no one
can violate the jail rules and regulations, and violating the rules means
another term for extension of prison life. Similarly, we in this material
existence are always fearful. This fearfulnessis called anxiety. Everyone in
the material life, in all species and varieties of life, is full of anxieties,
either by breaking or without breaking the laws of nature. Liberation, or
mukti, means getting relief from these constant anxieties. This is only

ossible when the anxiety is changed in the devotional service of the Lord.
Srimad. Bhigavatam gives us this chance of changing the quality of anxiety
from matter to spirit. This is done in the association of a learned philosopher
like the self-realized Sukadeva Gosvami, the great son of Sri Vyasadeva.
Maharaja Pariksit, after receiving warning of his death, took advantage of
this opportunity by association with Sukadeva Gosvami and achieved the
desired result.

There is a sort of imitation of this reciting and hearing of Srimad-
Bhagavatam by professional men, and their foolish audience thinks that
they will get free from the clutches of material attachment and attain
the life of fearlessness. Such imitative hearing of Srimad-Bhagavatam is a
caricature only, and one should not be misled by such performance of
Bhagavatam saptaha, undertaken by ridiculous greedy fellows to main-
tain an establishment of material enjoyment.

TRANSLATION
Thus those who were expert in astrological knowledge and in perform-

returned to their respective homes.
PURPORT

The Vedas are the storehouse of knowledge, both material and spiritual.
But such knowledge aims at perfection of self-realization. In other words,
the Vedas are the guides for the civilized man in every respect. Since
human life is the opportunity to get free from all material miseries, it is
properly guided by the knowledge of the Vedas, both in the matters of
material needs and spiritual salvation. The specific intelligent class of men
who were devoted particularly in the knowledge of Vedas were called
the vipras, or the graduates of the Vedic knowledge. There are different
branches of knowledge in the Vedas, of which astrology and pathology
are two important branches necessary for the common man. So the
intelligent men, generally known as the brahmanas, took up all the different
branches of Vedic knowledge to guide society. Even the department of
military education (Dhanur-veda) was also taken up by such intelligent
men, and the vipras were also teachers of this section of knowledge, as
were Dronacarya, Krpacarya, etc.

The word vipra mentioned herein is significant. There is alittle difference
between the vipres and the brahmanas. The vipras are those who are
expert in karma-kanda, or fruitive activities, guiding the society towards
fulfilling the material necessities of life, whereas the brahmanas are expert
in spiritual knowledge of transcendence. This department of knowledge is
called jiidna-kanda, and above this there is the upasana-kanda. The culmina-
tion of upasana-kapda is devotional service of the Lord Visnu, and when
the brahmanas achieve perfection, they are called Vaisnavas. Visnu worship
is the highest of all modes of worship. Elevated brahmapas are Vaisnavas


--- Page 273 ---
Text 30] Birth of Emperor Pariksit 651
engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, and thus
Srimad-Bhagavatam, which is the science of devotional service, is very
dear to the Vaisnavas. And as explained in the beginning of the Srimad-
Bhagavatam, it is the mature fruit of Vedic knowledge and is superior
subject matter, above the three kandas, namely karma, jiana and upasana.
Amongst the karma-kanda experts, the jataka expert vipras were good
astrologers who could tell all the future history of a born child simply by
the astral calculations of the time (lagna), and such expert jataka-vipras
were present during the birth of Maharaja Pariksit, and his grandfather,
Maharaja Yudhisthira, awarded the vipras sufficiently with gold, land,
villages, grains and other valuable necessaries of life, which also include
cows. There is a need of such vipras in the social structure, and it is the
duty of the state to maintain them comfortably, as designed in the Vedic
procedure. Such expert vipras, being sufficiently paid by the state, could
give free service to the people in general, and thus this department of
Vedic knowledge could be available for all.

652 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 12
PURPORT

Maharaja Pariksit, fortunate as he was, got the impression of the Lord
even in the womb of his mother, and thus his contemplation on the Lord
was constantly with him. Once the impression of the transcendental form
of the Lord is fixed in one’s mind, he can never forget Him in any
circumstance. Child Pariksit, after coming out of the womb, was in the
habit of examining everyone to see whether he was the same personality
whom he first saw within the womb. But no one could be equal to or more
attractive than the Lord, and therefore he never accepted anyone. But the
Lord was constantly with him by such examination, and thus Maharaja
Pariksit was always engaged in the devotional service of the Lord by
remembrance.

Srila Jiva Gosvami remarks in this connection that every child, if given
an impression of the Lord from his very childhood, certainly becomes a
great devotee of the Lord like Maharija Pariksit. One may not be as
fortunate as Maharaja Pariksit to have the opportunity to see the Lord in
the womb of his mother, but even if he is not so fortunate, he can be made
so if the parents of the child desire him to be so. There is a practical exam-
ple in my personal life in this connection. My father was a pure devotee of
the Lord, and when I was only four or five years old, my father gave me a
couple of forms of Radha and Krsna. In a playful manner, I used to
worship these Deities along with my sister, and I used to imitate the
performances of a neighboring temple of Radha-Govinda. By constantly
visiting this neighboring temple and copying the ceremonies in connection
with my own Deities of play, I developed a natural affinity for the Lord.
My father used to observe all the ceremonies befitting my position. Later
on, these activities were suspended due to my association in the schools
and colleges, and I became completely out of practice. But in my youthful
days, when I met my spiritual master Sri Srimad Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati
Gosvami Maharaja, again I revived my old habit, and the same playful
Deities became my worshipful Deities in proper regulation. .This was
followed up until I left the family connection, and I am pleased that my
generous father gave the first impression which was developed later into
regulative devotional service by His Divine Grace. Maharaja Prahlada also
advised that such impressions of a godly relation must be impregnated
from the beginning of childhood, otherwise one may miss the opportunity
of the human form of life, which is very valuable although it is temporary
like others.

TRANSLATION
Just at this time, King Yudhisthira was considering performing a
horse sacrifice to get freed from sins incurred from fighting with kinsmen.
But he became anxious to get some wealth, for there were no surplus
funds outside of fines and tax collection.
PURPORT

As the brahmanas, the vipras had a right to be subsidized by the state,
and similarly the state executive head had the right to collect taxes and
fines from the citizens. After the Battle of Kuruksetra the state treasury
was exhausted, and therefore there was no surplus fund except the fund
from tax collection and fines. Such funds were sufficient only for the state
budget, and having no excess fund, the King was anxious to get more
wealth in some other way in order to perform the horse sacrifice.
Maharaja Yudhisthira wanted to perform this sacrifice under the instruc-
tion of Bhismadeva.

Text 33] Birth of Emperor Pariksit 655
PURPORT

Maharaja Marutta: one of the great emperors of the world. He reigned
over the world long before the reign of Maharaja Yudhisthira. He was the
son of Maharaja Aviksit and was a great devotee of the son of the sun-god,
known as Yamaraja. His brother Samvarta was a rival priest of the great
Brhaspati, the learned priest of the demigods. He conducted one sacrifice
called Sankara-yajiia by which the Lord was so satisfied that He was
pleased to hand over to him the charge of a mountain peak of gold. This
peak of gold is somewhere in the Himalayan mountains, and modern
adventurers may try to find it there. He was so powerful an emperor that
at the day’s end of sacrifice, the demigods from the other planets like
Indra, Candra, Brhaspati, etc., used to visit his palace. And because he had
the gold peak at his disposal, he had sufficient gold in his possession. The
canopy of the sacrificial altar was completely made of gold. In his daily
performances of the sacrificial ceremonies, some of the inhabitants of the
Vayuloka (airy planets) were invited to expedite the cooking work of the
ceremony. And the assembly of the demigods in the ceremony was led by
Visvadeva.

By his constant pious work he was able to drive out all kinds of diseases
from the jurisdiction of his kingdom. All the inhabitants of higher planets
like Devaloka, Pitrloka, etc., were all pleased with him for his great
sacrificial ceremonies. Every day he used to give in charity to the learned
brahmanas such things as beddings, seats, conveyances and sufficient
quantities of gold. Because of munificent charities and performances of
innumerable sacrifices, the King of heaven, Indradeva, was fully satisfied
with him and always wished for his welfare. Due to his pious activities, he
remained a young man throughout his life and reigned over the world for
one thousand years, surrounded by his satisfied subjects, ministers, legiti-
mate wife, sons and brothers. Even Lord Sri Krsna praised his spirit of
pious activities. He handed over his only daughter to Maharsi Angira, and
by his good blessings, he was elevated to the kingdom of heaven. First of
all, he wanted to offer the priesthood of his sacrifices to learned Brhaspati,
but the demigod refused to accept the post because of the King’s being a
human being or man of this earth. He was very sorry for this, but on the
advice of Narada Muni he appointed Samvarta to the post, and he was
successful in his mission.

The success of a particular type of sacrifice completely depends on the
priest in charge. In this age, all kinds of sacrifice are forbidden because
there is no learned priest amongst the so-called brahmanas who go by the
false notion of becoming sons of brahmanas without brahminical qualifi-


--- Page 278 ---
656 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 12
cations. In this age of Kali, therefore. only one kind of sacrifice is recom-
mended, saiikirtana-yajiia, as inaugurated by Lord Sri Caitanya Maha-
prabhu.

TRANSLATION
By those riches, the King could procure the ingredients for three horse
sacrifices. Thus the pious King Yudhisthira, who was very fearful after the
Battle of Kuruksetra, pleased Lord Hari the Personality of Godhead.
PURPORT

Maharaja Yudhisthira was the ideal and celebrated pious King of the
world, and still he was greatly afraid after the execution of the Battle of
Kuruksetra because of the mass killing in the fight, all of which was done
only to install him on the throne. He therefore took all the responsibility
for sins committed in the warfare, and to get rid of all these sins, he
wanted to perform three sacrifices in which horses are offered at the altar.
Such a sacrifice is very costly. Even Maharaja Yudhisthira had to collect
the necessary heaps of gold left by Maharaja Marutta and the brahmanas
who were given gold in charity by King Marutta. The learned brahmanas
could not take away all the loads of gold given by Maharaja Marutta, and
therefore they left behind the major portion of the gift. And Maharaja


--- Page 279 ---
Text 34] Birth of Emperor Pariksit 657
Marutta also did not recollect such heaps of gold given away in charity.
Besides that, all the golden plates and utensils which were used in the
sacrifice were also thrown in the dustbins, and all such heaps of gold re-
mained unclaimed property for a long time, till Maharaja Yudhisthira
collected them for his own purposes. Lord Sri Krsna advised the brothers
of Maharaja Yudhisthira to collect the unclaimed property because it be-
longed to the King. The more astonishing thing is that no subject of the
state also collected such unclaimed gold for industrial enterprise, or any-
thing like that. This means that the state citizens were completely satisfied
with all necessities of life and therefore not inclined to accept unnecessary
productive enterprises for sense gratification. Maharaja Yudhisthira also
requisitioned the heaps of gold for performing sacrifices and for pleasing
the Supreme Hari Personality of Godhead. Otherwise he had no desire to
collect them for the state treasury.

One should take lessons from the acts of Maharaja Yudhisthira. He was
afraid of sins committed on the battlefield, and therefore he wanted to
satisfy the supreme authority. This indicates that unintentional sins are
also committed in our daily occupational discharge of duties, and to coun-
teract even such unintentional crimes, one must perform sacrifices as they
are recommended in the revealed scriptures. The Lord says in the Bhagavad-
gita (yajiiarthat karmano ’nyatra loko ‘yar karma-bandhanah) that one
must perform sacrifices recommended in the scriptures in order to get rid of
commitments of all unauthorized work, or even unintentional crimes
which we are apt to commit. By doing so, one shall be freed from all
kinds of sins. And those who do not do so, but work for self-interest or
sense gratification, have to undergo all tribulations accrued from com-
mitted sins. Therefore, the main purpose of performing sacrifices is to
satisfy the Supreme Personality Hari. The process of performing sacrifices
may be different in terms of different times, places, and persons, but the
aim of such sacrifices is one and the same at all times and in all circum-
stances, viz., satisfaction of the Supreme Lord Hari. That is the way of
pious life, and that is the way of peace and prosperity in the world at
large. Maharaja Yudhisthira did all these as the ideal pious King in the
world.

If Maharaja Yudhisthira is a sinner in his daily discharge of duties, in
royal administration of state affairs, wherein killing of man and animals
is a recognized art, then we can just imagine the amount of sins committed
consciously or unconsciously by the untrained population of the Kali-yuga
who have no way to perform sacrifice to please the Supreme Lord. The


--- Page 280 ---
658 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 12
Bhagavatam says, therefore, that the prime duty of the human being is to
satisfy the Supreme Lord by the performance of one’s occupational duty.
(Bhag. 1.2.13)

Let any man of any place of community, caste or creed be engaged in
any sort of occupational duty, but he must agree to perform sacrifices as it
is recommended in the scriptures for the particular place, time and person.
In the Vedic literatures it is recommended that in Kali-yuga people engage
in glorifying the Lord by chanting the holy name of Krsna (Kirtanad eva
krsnasya mukta-sangah param vrajet) without offense. By doing so one can
be freed from all sins and thus can attain the highest perfection of life by
returning home, back to Godhead. We have already discussed this more
than once in this great literature in different places, especially in the intro-
ductory portion by sketching the life of Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu,
and still we are repeating the same with a view to bring about peace and
prosperity in society.

The Lord has declared openly in the Bhagavad-gita how He becomes
pleased with us, and the same process is practically demonstrated in the
life and preaching work of Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. The perfect
process of performing yajiias or sacrifice to please the Supreme Lord
Hari (the Personality of Godhead who gets us free from all miseries of
existence) is to follow the ways of Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu in
this dark age of quarrel and dissension.

Maharaja Yudhisthira had to collect heaps of gold to secure the para-
phernalia for the horse sacrifice yajiia in days of sufficiency, so we can
hardly think of such performance of yajiias in these days of insufficiency
and complete scarcity of gold. At the present moment we have heaps
of papers and promises of their being converted into gold by economic
development of modern civilization, and still there is no possibility of
spending riches like Maharaja Yudhisthira, either individually or collectively
or by state patronization. Just suitable, therefore, for the age, is the
method recommended by Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu in terms of the
Sastra. Such a method requires no expenditure at all and yet can award
more benefit than other expensive methods of yajiia performances.

The horse sacrifice yajiia or cow sacrifice yajiia performed by the Vedic
regulations shouldn’t be misunderstood as a process of killing animals. On
the contrary, animals offered for the yajiia were rejuvenated to a new span
of life by the transcendental power of chanting the Vedic hymns, which, if
properly chanted, are different from what is understood by the common
layman. The Veda-mantras are all practical, and the proof is rejuvenation
of the sacrificed animal.


--- Page 281 ---
Text 35] Birth of Emperor Pariksit 659

There is no possibility of such methodical chanting of the Vedic hymns
by the so-called brahmanas or priests of the present age. The untrained
descendants of the twice-born families are no more like their forefathers,
and thus they are counted amongst the sudras or once-born men. The once-
born man is unfit to chant the Vedic hymns, and therefore there is no
practical utility of chanting the original hymns.

And to save them all, Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu propounded the
sankirtana movement or yajiia for all practical purposes, and the people of
the present age are strongly recommended to follow this sure and recog-
nized path.

relatives, the Lord remained a few months.
PURPORT

Lord Sri Krsna was invited by Maharaja Yudhisthira to look into the
supervision of the performances of yajiia, and the Lord, to abide by the
orders of His elderly cousin, caused the performance of yajiias by learned

twice-born brahmanas. Simply taking birth in the family of a brahmana
does not make one qualified to perform yajiias. He must be twice born by
proper training and initiation from the bona fide @carya. The once-born
scions of brahmana families are equal with the once-born siidras, and such
brahma-bandhu or unqualified once-born scions must be rejected for any
purpose of religious or Vedic function. Lord Sri Krsna was entrusted to
look after this arrangement, and perfect as He is, He caused the yajiias to
be performed by the bona fide twice-born brahmanas for successful
execution.

EXPLANATION OF THE COVER
1. The original spiritual planet, which resembles the whorl
wl of a huge lotus flower, is called Goloka Vrndavana. It is the
abode of Lord Krsna, the original Personality of Godhead.
2. This original planet Goloka throws off a spiritual ray of
ay effulgence called brahmajyoti which is the ultimate goal of
the impersonalists.

3. Within this unlimited brahmajyoti there are unlimited

| ‹ numbers of spiritual planets, as there are innumerable

material planets within the sun rays of the material universes.

These spiritual planets are dominated by plenary expansions

4 of Lord Krsna, and the inhabitants there are ever liberated

living beings. They are all four-handed. The Lord is known

there as Narayana, and the planets are known as Vaikunthas.

# 4."Sometimes a spiritual cloud overtakes a corner of the

spiritual sky of brahimajyoti, and the covered portion is

called the mahat-tattva. The Lord then, by His portion as

= Maha-Visnu, lies down in the water within the mahat-
tattva. The water is called the Causal Ocean (kdrana-jala).

5. As He sleeps within the Causal Ocean, innumerable
universes are generated with His breathing. These floating

> universes are scattered all over the Causal Ocean. They stay
during a breath ০ f Mah3a-Visnu.

6. In each and every universal globe the same Mah3a-Visnu.
enters again as Garbhodakasayi Visnu and lies there on the
Garbha Ocean on the serpentine Sesa incarnation. From His
navel-abdomen sprouts a lotus stem, and on the lotus,
Brahma, the lord of the universe, is born. Brahma creates
all living beings of different shapes in terms of desire within
the universe. He also creates the sun, moon and other demi-
gods.

7. The sun is situated almost in the center of each and
every universe, and it distributes profuse light and heat all £
over the universe. There are millions and billions of suns in
all the millions and billions of universes within the mahat- ২
tattva. The suns and moons are required within the universes চু
because they are dark by nature. The Vedas instruct us to go
out of the dark universes and reach the glowing effulgence, 4
the brahmajyoti. i

8. The brahmajyot/ is due to the illuminating Vaikuntha
planets, which need no sun or moon or power of electricity.

Srimad-Bhagavatam helps us reach the supreme planet,
Goloka Vrndavana. The door is open for everyone. Human
life is meant for this particular aim, for it is the highest
perfection.

His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada ॥
first met his spiritual master, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati ”
Gosvami Maharaja, in Calcutta in 1922. Srtla Bhaktisiddhanta
liked this educated young man and injected in him the idea
of preaching the message of Srimad-Bhagavatam all over the
world. At Allahabad in 1933 Srila Prabhupada became his
formally initiated disciple, and in 1937, just days before
his spiritual master’s departure from this mortal world, he
was specifically ordered to spread Krsna consciousness in the
English language. Thus in 1944 Srila Prabhupada started ik
Back to Godhead magazine, which is now circulated in six
different languages throughout the world, and he also pub-
lished, in English, the first three volumes of his Srimad-
Bhagavatam.

In 1965, at the advanced age of 70, His Divine Grace
sailed to the United States to fulfill his master’s sacred
mission, bringing with him only seven dollars, some books
and a pair of hand cymbals. Shortly afterwards he began
classes on Bhagavad-gitd in a small storefront in New York
City. Now, only six years later, Srila Prabhupada’s Inter- ४ 3
national Society for Krishna Consciousness, with more than ४ ॥
seventy centers in major cities throughout the world, has
become an important institution of spiritual knowledge and
culture, and Srila Prabhupada’s authoritative translations,
commentaries and summary studies of Vedic literature have
become standard textbooks of transcendental science.
