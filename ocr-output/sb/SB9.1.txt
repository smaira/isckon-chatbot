Preface

We must know the present need of human society. And what is that
need? Human society is no longer bounded by geographical limits to par-
ticular countries or communities. Human society is broader than in the
Middle Ages, and the world tendency is toward one state or one human
society. The ideals of spiritual communism, according to Srimad-
Bhagavatam, are based more or less on the oneness of the entire human
society, nay, of the entire energy of living beings. The need is felt by
great thinkers to make this a successful ideology. Srimad-Bhagavatam
will fill this need in human society. It begins, therefore, with the apho-
rism of Vedanta philosophy janmady asya yatah to establish the ideal of
a common cause.

Human society, at the present moment, is not in the darkness of
oblivion. It has made rapid progress in the field of material comforts,
education and economic development throughout the entire world. But
there is a pinprick somewhere in the social body at large, and therefore
there are large-scale quarrels, even over less important issues. There is
need of a clue as to how humanity can become one in peace, friendship
and prosperity with a common cause. Srimad-Bhagavatam will fill this
need, for it is a cultural presentation for the re-spiritualization of the
entire human society.

Srimad-Bhagavatam should be introduced also in the schools and col-
leges, for it is recommended by the great student-devotee Prahlada
Mahairija in order to change the demoniac face of society.

(Bhag. 7.6.1)

Disparity in human society is due to lack of principles in a godless
civilization. There is God, or the Almighty One, from whom everything
emanates, by whom everything is maintained and in whom everything

is merged to rest. Material science has tried to find the ultimate source
of creation very insufficiently, but it is a fact that there is one ulti-
mate source of everything that be. This ultimate source is explained
rationally and authoritatively in the beautiful Bhagavatam or Srimad-
Bhagavatam.

Srimad-Bhagavatam is the transcendental science not only for know-
ing the ultimate source of everything but also for knowing our relation
with Him and our duty towards perfection of the human society on the
basis of this perfect knowledge. It is powerful reading matter in the
Sanskrit language, and it is now rendered into English elaborately so that
simply by a careful reading one will know God perfectly well, so much so
that the reader will be sufficiently educated to defend himself from the
onslaught of atheists. Over and above this, the reader will be able to con-
vert others to accepting God as a concrete principle.

Srimad-Bhagavatam begins with the definition of the ultimate source.
It is a bona fide commentary on the Vedanta-siitra by the same author,
Srila Vyasadeva, and gradually it develops into nine cantos up to the
highest state of God realization. The only qualification one needs to study
this great book of transcendental knowledge is to proceed step by step
cautiously and not jump forward haphazardly like with an ordinary
book. It should be gone through chapter by chapter, one after another.
The reading matter is so arranged with its original Sanskrit text, its
English transliteration, synonyms, translation and purports so that one is
sure to become a God-realized soul at the end of finishing the first nine
cantos.

The Tenth Canto is distinct from the first nine cantos because it deals
directly with the transcendental activities of the Personality of Godhead
Sri Krsna. One will be unable to capture the effects of the Tenth Canto
without going through the first nine cantos. The book is complete in
twelve cantos, each independent, but it is good for all to read them in
small installments one after another.

I must admit my frailties in presenting Srimad-Bhagavatam, but still
I am hopeful of its good reception by the thinkers and leaders of society
on the strength of the following statement of Srimad-Bhagavatam
(1.5.11):

tad-vag-visargo janatagha-viplavo
yasmin prati-§lokam abaddhavaty api

“On the other hand, that literature which is full with descriptions of the
transcendental glories of the name, fame, form and pastimes of the un-
limited Supreme Lord is a transcendental creation meant to bring about a
revolution in the impious life of a misdirected civilization. Such tran-
scendental literatures, even though irregularly composed, are heard,

sung and accepted by purified men who are thoroughly honest.”

Introduction

“This Bhagavata Purana is as brilliant as the sun, and it has arisen
just after the departure of Lord Krsna to His own abode, accompanied by
religion, knowledge, etc. Persons who have lost their vision due to the
dense darkness of ignorance in the age of Kali shall get light from this
Purana.” (Srimad-Bhagavatam 1.3.43)

The timeless wisdom of India is expressed in the Vedas, ancient
Sanskrit texts that touch upon all fields of human knowledge. Originally
preserved through oral tradition, the Vedas were first put into writing
five thousand years ago by Srila Vyasadeva, the “literary incarnation of
God.” After compiling the Vedas, Vyasadeva set forth their essence in
the aphorisms known as Vedanta-sitras. Srimad-Bhagavatam is
Vyasadeva’s commentary on his own Vedanta-siitras. It was written in
the maturity of his spiritual life under the direction of Narada Muni, his
spiritual master. Referred to as “the ripened fruit of the tree of Vedic
literature,” Srimad-Bhagavatam is the most complete and authoritative
exposition of Vedic knowledge.

After compiling the Bhagavatam, Vyasa impressed the synopsis of it
upon his son, the sage Sukadeva Gosvami. Sukadeva Gosvami subse-
quently recited the entire Bhagavatam to Maharaja Pariksit in an assem-
bly of learned saints on the bank of the Ganges at Hastinapura (now
Delhi). Maharaja Pariksit was the emperor of the world and was a great
rajarsi (saintly king). Having received a warning that he would die
within a week, he renounced his entire kingdom and retired to the bank
of the Ganges to fast until death and receive spiritual enlightenment.
The Bhagavatam begins with Emperor Pariksit’s sober inquiry to
Sukadeva Gosvami: “You are the spiritual master of great saints and
devotees. I am therefore begging you to show the way of perfection for
all persons, and especially for one who is about to die. Please let me know
what a man should hear, chant, remember and worship, and also what he
should not do. Please explain all this to me.”

Sukadeva Gosvami’s answer to this question, and numerous other
questions posed by Maharaja Pariksit, concerning everything from the
nature of the self to the origin of the universe, held the assembled sages

xii


--- Page 5 ---
xiv Srimad-Bhagavatam

in rapt attention continuously for the seven days leading to the King’s
death. The sage Sita Gosvami, who was present on the bank of the
Ganges when Sukadeva Gosvami first recited Srimad-Bhagavatam, later
repeated the Bhagavatam before a gathering of sages in the forest of
Naimisaranya. Those sages, concerned about the spiritual welfare of the
people in general, had gathered to perform a long, continuous chain of
sacrifices to counteract the degrading influence of the incipient age of
Kali. In response to the sages’ request that he speak the essence of Vedic
wisdom, Sita Gosvami repeated from memory the entire eighteen thou-
sand verses of Srimad-Bhagavatam, as spoken by Sukadeva Gosvami to
Maharaja Pariksit.

The reader of Srimad-Bhagavatam hears Sita Gosvami relate the
questions of Maharaja Pariksit and the answers of Sukadeva Gosvami.
Also, Sata Gosvami sometimes responds directly to questions put by
Saunaka Rsi, the spokesman for the sages gathered at Naimisaranya. One
therefore simultaneously hears two dialogues: one between Maharaja
Pariksit and Sukadeva Gosvami on the bank of the Ganges, and another
at Naimisaranya between Sita Gosvami and the sages at Naimisaranya
Forest, headed by Saunaka Rsi. Furthermore, while instructing King
Pariksit, Sukadeva Gosvami often relates historical episodes and gives
accounts of lengthy philosophical discussions between such great souls as
the saint Maitreya and his disciple Vidura. With this understanding of
the history of the Bhagavatam, the reader will easily be able to follow its
intermingling of dialogues and events from various sources. Since philo-
sophical wisdom, not chronological order, is most important in the text,
one need only be attentive to the subject matter of Srimad-Bhagavatam
to appreciate fully its profound message.

The translator of this edition compares the Bhdgavatam to sugar
candy—wherever you taste it, you will find it equally sweet and
relishable. Therefore, to taste the sweetness of the Bhagavatam, one may
begin by reading any of its volumes. After such an introductory taste,
however, the serious reader is best advised to go back to Volume One of
the First Canto and then proceed through the Bhagavatam, volume after
volume, in its natural order.

This edition of the Bhagavatam is the first complete English transla-
tion of this important text with an elaborate commentary, and it is the
first widely available to the English-speaking public. It is the product of

Introduction x
the scholarly and devotional effort of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhakti-
vedanta Swami Prabhupada, the world’s most distinguished teacher of
Indian religious and philosophical thought. His consummate Sanskrit
scholarship and intimate familiarity with Vedic culture and thought as
well as the modern way of life combine to reveal to the West a magnifi-
cent exposition of this important classic.

Readers will find this work of value for many reasons. For those in-
terested in the classical roots of Indian civilization, it serves as a vast
reservoir of detailed information on virtually every one of its aspects.
For students of comparative philosophy and religion, the Bhagavatam
offers a penetrating view into the meaning of India’s profound spiritual
heritage. To sociologists and anthropologists, the Bhagavatam reveals the
practical workings of a peaceful and scientifically organized Vedic
culture, whose institutions were integrated on the basis of a highly
developed spiritual world view. Students of literature will discover the
Bhagavatam to be a masterpiece of majestic poetry. For students of psy-
chology, the text provides important perspectives on the nature of con-
sciousness, human behavior and the philosophical study of identity.
Finally, to those seeking spiritual insight, the Bhagavatam offers simple
and practical guidance for attainment of the highest self-knowledge and
realization of the Absolute Truth. The entire multivolume text, pre-
sented by the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, promises to occupy a significant
place in the intellectual, cultural and spiritual life of modern man for a
long time to come.

CHAPTER ONE
King Sudyumna Becomes a Woman
This chapter describes how Sudyumna became a woman and how the
dynasty of Vaivasvata Manu was amalgamated with the Soma-varnsa, the
dynasty coming from the moon.

By the desire of Maharaja Pariksit, Sukadeva Gosvami told about the
dynasty of Vaivasvata Manu, who was formerly King Satyavrata, the
ruler of Dravida. While describing this dynasty, he also described how
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, while lying down in the waters of
devastation, gave birth to Lord Brahma from a lotus generated from His
navel. From the mind of Lord Brahma, Marici was generated, and his son
was Kasyapa. From Kaéyapa, through Aditi, Vivasvan was generated,
and from Vivasvan came Sraddhadeva Manu, who was born from the
womb of ऽवप]. Sraddhadeva’s wife, Sraddha, gave birth to ten sons,
such as Iksvaku and Nrga.

Sraddhadeva, or Vaivasvata Manu, the father of Maharaja Iksvaku,
was sonless before lksvaku’s birth, but by the grace of the great sage
Vasistha he performed a yajfia to satisfy Mitra and Varuna. Then, al-
though Vaivasvata Manu wanted a son, by the desire of his wife he got a
daughter named Ila. Manu, however, was not satisfied with the daughter.
Consequently, for Manu’s satisfaction, the great sage Vasistha prayed for
Ila to be transformed into a boy, and his prayer was fulfilled by the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus Ila became a beautiful young
man named Sudyumna.

Once upon a time, Sudyumna went on tour with his ministers. At the
foot of the mountain Sumeru there is a forest named Sukumara, and as
soon as they entered that forest, they were all transformed into women.
When Maharaja Pariksit inquired from Sukadeva Gosvami about the
reason for this transformation, Sukadeva Gosviami described how
Sudyumna, being transformed into a woman, accepted Budha, the son of
the moon, as her husband and had a son named Puriirava. By the grace
of Lord Siva, Sudyumna received the benediction that he would live one
month as a woman and one month as a man. Thus he regained his
kingdom and had three sons, named Utkala, Gaya and Vimala, who were

all very religious. Thereafter, he entrusted his kingdom to Puridrava and
took the order of vanaprastha life.

PURPORT
Because Manu had no issue, he was pleased at the birth of the child,
even though a daughter, and gave her the name Ila. Later, however, he
was not very satisfied to see the daughter instead of a son. Because he had
no issue, he was certainly very glad at the birth of Ila, but his pleasure
was temporary.

bhagavan kim 1027 jatar
karma vo brahma-vadinam
viparyayam aho kastarn
maivarm sydd brahma-vikriya

bhagavan—O my lord; kim idam—what is this; jatam—born;
karma —fruitive activities; vah—of all of you; brahma-vadinam—of
you, who are expert in chanting the Vedic mantras; viparyayam—devia-
tion; aho—alas; kastam—painful; ma evam syat—thus it should not
have been; brahma-vikriya—this opposite action of the Vedic mantras.

TRANSLATION

My lord, all of you are expert in chanting the Vedic mantras.
How then has the result been opposite to the one desired? This is a
matter for lamentation. There should not have been such a rever-
sal of the results of the Vedic mantras.

PURPORT

In this age, the performance of yajiia has been forbidden because no
one can properly chant the Vedic mantras. If Vedic mantras are chanted
properly, the desire for which a sacrifice is performed must be suc-
cessful. Therefore the Hare Krsna chant is called the maha-mantra, the
great, exalted mantra above all other Vedic mantras, because simply
chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra brings so many beneficial effects.
As explained by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu (Siksastaka 1):

ceto-darpana-marjanan bhava-maha-davagni-nirvapanarn
Sreyah-kairava-candrika-vitaranari vidya-vadhi-jivanam
anandambudhi-vardhanam prati-padariv parnamrtasvadanar
sarvatma-snapanarii pararit vijayate $ri-krsna-sankirtanam

“Glory to the Sri Krsna sarkirtana, which cleanses the heart of all the
dust accumulated for years and extinguishes the fire of conditional life,
of repeated birth and death. This sarikirtana movement is the prime
benediction for humanity at large because it spreads the rays of the


--- Page 19 ---
Text 18] King Sudyumna Becomes a Woman 13
benediction moon. It is the life of all transcendental knowledge. It in-
creases the ocean of transcendental bliss, and it enables us to fully taste
the nectar for which we are always anxious.”

Therefore, the best performance of yajia given to us 15 the
sartkirtana-yajiia. Yajiiaih sarikirtana-prayair yajanti hi sumedhasah
(Bhag. 11.5.32). Those who are intelligent take advantage of the
greatest yajiia in this age by chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra in
congregation. When the Hare Krsna mantra is chanted by many men
together, the chanting is called sarikirtana, and as a result of such a
yajiia there will be clouds in the sky (yajiad bhavati parjanyah). In
these days of drought, people can gain relief from scarcity of rain and
food by the simple method of the Hare Krsna 20770. Indeed, this can
relieve all of human society. At present there are droughts throughout
Europe and America, and people are suffering, but if people take this
Krsna consciousness movement seriously, if they stop their sinful ac-
tivities and chant the Hare Krsna maha-mantra, all their problems will
be solved without difficulty. In other processes of yajiia there are dif-
ficulties because there are no learned scholars who can chant the mantras
perfectly well, nor is it possible to secure the ingredients to perform the
yajiia. Because human society is poverty-stricken and men are devoid of
Vedic knowledge and the power to chant the Vedic mantras, the Hare
Krsna maha-mantra is the only shelter. People should be intelligent
enough to chant it. Yajiaih sankirtana-prayair yajanti hi sumedhasah.
Those whose brains are dull cannot understand this chanting, nor can
they take to it.

dint of austerity and penances; dagdha-kilbisah—all kinds of material

TRANSLATION
You are all self-controlled, well balanced in mind, and aware of
the Absolute Truth. And because of austerities and penances you
are completely cleansed of all material contamination. Your words,
like those of the demigods, are never baffled. Then how is it possi-
ble that your determination has failed?
PURPORT
We have learned from many Vedic literatures that a benediction or
curse given by the demigods never proves false. By performing
austerities and penances, by controlling the senses and mind, and by
achieving full knowledge of the Absolute Truth, one is fully cleansed of
material contamination. Then one’s words and blessings, like those of the
demigods, are never a failure.

*“As a person puts on new garments, giving up old ones, the soul accepts
new material bodies, giving up the old and useless ones.”

The body is just like a dress, and here this is proved. Sudyumna and
his associates were all male, which means that their souls were covered
by male dress, but now they became female, which means that their
dress was changed. The soul, however, remains the same. It is said that
by modern medical treatment a male can be transformed into a female,
and a female into a male. The body, however, has no connection with the
soul. The body can be changed, either in this life or the next. Therefore,
one who has knowledge of the soul and how the soul transmigrates from
one body to another does not pay attention to the body, which is nothing
but a covering dress. Panditah sama-darsinah. Such a person sees the
soul, which is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. Therefore he is a
sama-darsi, a learned person.

TRANSLATION
O King Pariksit, Lord Siva was pleased with Vasistha. Therefore,
to satisfy him and to keep his own word to Parvati, Lord Siva said
to that saintly person, “Your disciple Sudyumna may remain a
male for one month and a female for the next. In this way he may
rule the world as he likes.”
PURPORT
The word gotrajah is significant in this connection. Brahmanas
generally act as spiritual masters of two dynasties. One is their disciplic
succession, and the other is the dynasty born of their semen. Both de-
scendants belong to the same gotra, or dynasty. In the Vedic system we
sometimes find that both brahmanas and ksatriyas and even vaisyas
come in the disciplic succession of the same rsis. Because the gotra and
dynasty are one, there is no difference between the disciples and the
family born of the semen. The same system still prevails in Indian
society, especially in regard to marriage, for which the gotra is calcu-
lated. Here the word gotrajah refers to those born in the same dynasty,
whether they be disciples or members of the family.

female every alternate month and therefore could not discharge his royal
duty. Consequently they were not very satisfied.

O King, Sudyumna had three very pious sons, named Utkala,
Gaya and Vimala, who became the kings of the Daksina-patha.

TRANSLATION
Thereafter, when the time was ripe, when Sudyumna, the king
of the world, was sufficiently old, he delivered the entire kingdom
to his son Purirava and entered the forest.
PURPORT
According to the Vedic system, one within the institution of varna and
asrama must leave his family life after he reaches fifty years of age
(paiicasad 11/11 , vanam vrajet). Thus Sudyumna followed the


--- Page 35 ---
Text 42] King Sudyumna Becomes a Woman 29
prescribed regulations of varndsrama by leaving the kingdom and going
to the forest to complete his spiritual life.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, First
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “King Sudyumna Becomes
a Woman.”

CHAPTER TWO
The Dynasties of the Sons of Manu
This Second Chapter describes the dynasties of the sons of Manu, headed
by Karasa.

After Sudyumna accepted the order of vanaprastha and departed for
the forest, Vaivasvata Manu, being desirous of sons, worshiped the
Supreme Personality of Godhead and consequently begot ten sons like
Maharaja Iksviaku, all of whom were like their father. One of these sons,
Prsadhra, was engaged in the duty of protecting cows at night with a
sword in his hand. Following the order of his spiritual master, he would
stand in this way for the entire night. Once, in the darkness of night, a
tiger seized a cow from the cowshed, and when Prsadhra came to know
this, he took a sword in his hand and followed the tiger. Unfortunately,
when he finally approached the tiger, he could not distinguish between
the cow and the tiger in the dark, and thus he killed the cow. Because of
this, his spiritual master cursed him to take birth in a Sidra family, but
Prsadhra practiced mystic yoga, and in bhakti-yoga he worshiped the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then he voluntarily entered a blazing
forest fire, thus relinquishing his material body and going back home,
back to Godhead.

Kavi, the youngest son of Manu, was a great devotee of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead from his very childhood. From Manu’s son
known as Karusa, a sect of ksatriyas known as Kartasas was generated.
Manu also had a son known as Dhrsta, from whom another sect of
ksatriyas was generated, but although they were born of one who had the
qualities of a ksatriya, they became brahmanas. From Nrga, another son
of Manu, came the sons and grandsons known as Sumati, Bhatajyoti and
Vasu. From Vasu, in succession, came Pratika, and from him came
Oghavan. Descending in order from the seminal dynasty of Narisyanta,
another son of Manu, were Citrasena, Rksa, Midhvin, Parna, Indrasena,
Vitihotra, Satyasrava, Urusrava, Devadatta and Agnivesya. From the
ksatriya known as Agnivedya came the celebrated brahmana dynasty
known as Agnivesyayana. From the seminal dynasty of Dista, another
son of Manu, came Nabhaga, and from him in succession came

Rambha, Khaninetra, Karandhama, Aviksit, Marutta, Dama,
Rajyavardhana, Sudhrti, Nara, Kevala, Dhundhuman, Vegavan, Budha
and Trnabindu. In this way, many sons and grandsons were born in this
dynasty. From Trnabindu came a daughter named Ilavila, from whom
Kuvera took birth. Trnabindu also had three sons, named Visila,
Stnyabandhu and Dhamraketu. The son of Visila was Hemacandra, his
son was Dhumraksa, and his son was Samyama. The sons of Sarnyama
were Devaja and Krs$asva. Kr$aéva’s son, Somadatta, performed an
Asvamedha sacrifice, and by worshiping the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Visnu, he achieved the supreme perfection of going back
home, back to Godhead.

TRANSLATION

Among these sons, Prsadhra, following the order of his spiritual
master, was engaged as a protector of cows. He would stand all

night with a sword to give the cows protection.

PURPORT
One who becomes virasana takes the vow to stand all night with a
sword to give protection to the cows. Because Prsadhra was engaged in
this way, it is to be understood that he had no dynasty. We can further
understand from this vow accepted by Prsadhra how essential it is to pro-
tect the cows. Some son of a ksatriya would take this vow to protect the
cows from ferocious animals, even at night. What then is to be said of
sending cows to slaughterhouses? This is the most sinful activity in
human society.

the stars were covered by clouds, he mistook the cow for the tiger
and mistakenly cut off the cows’ head with great force.

TRANSLATION
Although Prsadhra had committed the sin unknowingly, his
family priest, Vasistha, cursed him, saying, “In your next life you
shall not be able to become a ksatriya. Instead, you shall take birth
as a Sudra because of killing the cow.”
PURPORT
It appears that Vasistha was not free from tamo-guna, the mode of ig-
norance. As the family priest or spiritual master of Prsadhra, Vasistha
should have taken Prsadhra’s offense very lightly, but instead Vasistha
cursed him to become a $izdra. It is the duty of a family priest not to


--- Page 43 ---
38 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 2
curse a disciple but to give him relief through the performance of some
sort of atonement. Vasistha, however, did just the opposite. Therefore
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says that he was durmati; in other
words, his intelligence was not very good.

Being unaffected by material conditions, being pleased with what-
ever was available by the grace of the Lord to maintain body and
soul together, and being equal toward everyone, he gave full atten-
tion to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vasudeva, who is the
transcendental Supersoul, free from material contamination. Thus
Prsadhra, fully satisfied in pure knowledge, always keeping his
mind on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, achieved pure de-
votional service to the Lord and began traveling all over the world,
without affection for material activities, as if he were deaf, dumb
and blind.

TRANSLATION

With this attitude, Prsadhra became a great saint, and when he
entered the forest and saw a blazing forest fire, he took this oppor-
tunity to burn his body in the fire. Thus he achieved the transcen-
dental, spiritual world.

PURPORT
The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (4.9):


--- Page 46 ---
Text 15] The Dynasties of the Sons of Manu 41
Janma karma ca me divyam
evar yo vetti tattvatah
tyaktva deham punar janma
naiti mam eti so ’rjuna
“One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and ac-
tivities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this ma-
terial world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.” Prsadhra, because
of his karma, was cursed to take his next birth as a sitddra, but because he
took to saintly life, specifically concentrating his mind always upon the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, he became a pure devotee. Im-
mediately after giving up his body in the fire, he reached the spiritual
world, as mentioned in Bhagavad-gita (mam eti), as a result of his devo-
tional situation. Devotional service performed by thinking of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead is so powerful that although Prsadhra
was cursed he avoided the terrible consequence of becoming a $iidra and
instead returned home, back to Godhead. As stated in Brahma-samhita
(5.54):
yas tv indra-gopam athavendram aho sva-karma-
bandhanuripa-phala-bhajanam atanoti
karmani nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bhajarm
govindam adi-purusari tam aha bhajami
Those who engage in devotional service are unaffected by the results of
their material activities. Otherwise, everyone, from the smallest microbe
up to the King of heaven, Indra, is subject to the laws of karma. A pure
devotee, being always engaged in the service of the Lord, is exempt from
these laws.

head within the core of his heart. Thus he attained perfection.

TRANSLATION
Dista had a son by the name Nabhaga. This Nabhaga, who was
different from the Nabhaga described later, became a vaiSya by oc-
cupational duty. The son of Nabhaga was known as Bhalandana,
the son of Bhalandana was Vatsapriti, and his son was Pramsu.
Prarmsu’s son was Pramati, Pramati’s son was Khanitra, Khanitra’s
son was Caksusa, and his son was Vivimsati.
PURPORT
From Manu, one son became a ksatriya, another a brahmana, and
another a vaiSya. This confirms the statement by Narada Muni, yasya
yal laksanari proktam puriso varnabhivyaijakam (81:08. 7.11.35). One
should always remember that brahmanas, ksatriyas and vaisSyas should
never be regarded as members of a caste by birth. A brahmana may be
changed into a ksatriya, and a ksatriya into a brahmana. Similarly, a
brahmana or ksatriya may be changed into a vaiSya, and a vaiSya into a
brahmana or ksatriya. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (catur-
varnpyam maya srstam guna-karma-vibhagasah). So one is a brahmana,
ksatriya or vaisya never by birth, but by quality. There is a great need of
brahmanas. Therefore, in the Krsna consciousness movement, we are
trying to train some brahmanas to guide human society. Because at pres-
ent there is a scarcity of brahmanas, the brain of human society is lost.
Because practically everyone is a Siidra, no one at the present moment
can guide the members of society to the proper path by which to achieve
perfection in life.

Visnu. By worshiping the Supreme Lord, he achieved the most ex-
alted post, a residence on the planet to which great mystic yogis
are elevated. The son of Somadatta was Sumati, whose son was
Janamejaya. All these kings appearing in the dynasty of Visala
properly maintained the celebrated position of King Trnabindu.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Second
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “The Dynasties of the Sons
of Manu.”

CHAPTER THREE
The Marriage
of Sukanya and Cyavana Muni
This chapter describes the dynasty of Saryati, another son of Manu, and
also tells about Sukanya and Revati.

Devajfia Saryati gave instructions about what to do in the ritualistic
ceremony observed on the second day of the yajiia of the Angirasas. One
day, Saryati, along with his daughter, known as Sukanya, went to the
asrama of Cyavana Muni. There Sukanya saw two glowing substances
within a hole of earthworms, and by chance she pierced those two glow-
ing substances. As soon as she did this, blood began to ooze from that
hole. Consequently, King Saryati and his companions suffered from con-
stipation and inability to pass urine. When the King asked why circum-
stances had suddenly changed, he found that Sukanya was the cause of
this misfortune. Then they all offered prayers to Cyavana Muni just to
satisfy him according to his own desire, and Devajiia Saryati offered his
daughter to Cyavana Muni, who was a very old man.

When the heavenly physicians the Asvini-kumara brothers once
visited Cyavana Muni, the muni requested them to give him back his
youth. These two physicians took Cyavana Muni to a particular lake, in
which they bathed and regained full youth. After this, Sukanya could not
distinguish her husband. She then surrendered unto the ASvini-
kumaras, who were very satisfied with her chastity and who therefore in-
troduced her again to her husband. Cyavana Muni then engaged King
Saryati in performing the soma-yajiia and gave the A$vini-kumaras the
privilege to drink soma-rasa. The King of heaven, Lord Indra, became
very angry at this, but he could do no harm to Saryati. Henceforward, the
Asvini-kumira physicians were able to share in the soma-rasa.

Saryati later had three sons, named Uttanabarhi, Anarta and
Bhiarisena. Anarta had one son, whose name was Revata. Revata had one
hundred sons, of whom the eldest was Kakudmi. Kakudmi was advised
by Lord Brahma to offer his beautiful daughter, Revati, to Baladeva, who
belongs to the visnu-tattva category. After doing this, Kakudmi retired

from family life and entered the forest of Badarikasrama to execute
austerities and penances.

the great sage Cyavana Muni everything about how his daughter had ig-
norantly committed such an offense. The muni, however, inquired from
the King whether the daughter was married. In this way, the King,
understanding the purpose of the great sage Cyavana Muni (tad-
abhiprayam gjndya), immediately gave the muni his daughter in charity
and escaped the danger of being cursed. Thus with the permission of the
great sage the King returned home.

mind of her husband; apramatta anuvrttibhih—by executing services
without being bewildered.
TRANSLATION

Cyavana Muni was very irritable, but since Sukanya had gotten
him as her husband, she dealt with him carefully, according to his
mood. Knowing his mind, she performed service to him without
being bewildered.

PURPORT

This is an indication of the relationship between husband and wife. A
great personality like Cyavana Muni has the temperament of always
wanting to be in a superior position. Such a person cannot submit to any-
one. Therefore, Cyavana Muni had an irritable temperament. His wife,
Sukanyi, could understand his attitude, and under the circumstances she
treated him accordingly. If any wife wants to be happy with her husband,
she must try to understand her husband’s temperament and please him.
This is victory for a woman. Even in the dealings of Lord Krsna with His
different queens, it has been seen that although the queens were the
daughters of great kings, they placed themselves before Lord Krsna as
His maidservants. However great a woman may be, she must place her-
self before her husband in this way; that is to say, she must be ready to
carry out her husband’s orders and please him in all circumstances. Then
her life will be successful. When the wife becomes as irritable as the hus-
band, their life at home is sure to be disturbed or ultimately completely
broken. In the modern day, the wife is never submissive, and therefore
home life is broken even by slight incidents. Either the wife or the hus-
band may take advantage of the divorce laws. According to the Vedic law,
however, there is no such thing as divorce laws, and a woman must be
trained to be submissive to the will of her husband. Westerners contend
that this is a slave mentality for the wife, but factually it is not; it is the
tactic by which a woman can conquer the heart of her husband, however
irritable or cruel he may be. In this case we clearly see that although
Cyavana Muni was not young but indeed old enough to be Sukanya’s
grandfather and was also very irritable, Sukanya, the beautiful young
daughter of a king, submitted herself to her old husband and tried to
please him in all respects. Thus she was a faithful and chaste wife.

TRANSLATION
Thereafter, some time having passed, the Asvini-kumara
brothers, the heavenly physicians, happened to come to Cyavana
Muni’s aérama. After offering them respectful obeisances, Cyavana
Muni requested them to give him youthful life, for they were able
to do so.
PURPORT
The heavenly physicians like the Asvini-kumaras could give youthful
life even to one who was advanced in age. Indeed, great yogis, with their
mystic powers, can even bring a dead body back to life if the structure of
the body is in order. We have already discussed this in connection with
Bali Maharaja’s soldiers and their treatment by Sukracarya. Modern
medical science has not yet discovered how to bring a dead body back to
life or bring youthful energy to an old body, but from these verses we
can understand that such treatment is possible if one is able to take
knowledge from the Vedic information. The Aévini-kumaras were expert
in Ayur-veda, as was Dhanvantari. In every department of material
science, there is a perfection to be achieved, and to achieve it one must
consult the Vedic literature. The highest perfection is to become a


--- Page 70 ---
66 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 3
devotee of the Lord. To attain this perfection, one must consult Srimad-
Bhagavatam, which is understood to be the ripe fruit of the Vedic desire
tree (nigama-kalpa-taror galitarn phalam).

and veins visible all over his body, and all three of them entered
the lake.
PURPORT
Cyavana Muni was so old that he could not enter the lake alone. Thus
the Asvini-kumaras caught hold of his body, and the three of them
entered the lake.

The chaste and very beautiful Sukanya could not distinguish her
husband from the two Asévini-kumaras, for they were equally
beautiful. Not understanding who her real husband was, she took
shelter of the A$vini-kumaras.
PURPORT
Sukanya could have selected any one of them as her husband, for one
could not distinguish among them, but because she was chaste, she took
shelter of the Asvini-kumaras so that they could inform her who her ac-
tual husband was. A chaste woman will never accept any man other than
her husband, even if there be someone equally as handsome and
qualified.

TRANSLATION
O unchaste girl, what is this that you have desired to do? You
have cheated the most respectable husband, who is honored by
everyone, for I see that because he was old, diseased and therefore
unattractive, you have left his company to accept as your husband
this young man, who appears to be a beggar from the street.
PURPORT
This shows the values of Vedic culture. According to the circum-
stances, Sukanya had been given a husband who was too old to be com-
patible with her. Because Cyavana Muni was diseased and very old, he
was certainly unfit for the beautiful daughter of King Saryati.


--- Page 76 ---
72 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 3
Nonetheless, her father expected her to be faithful to her husband.
When he suddenly saw that his daughter had accepted someone else,
even though the man was young and handsome, he immediately
chastised her as asati, unchaste, because he assumed that she had ac-
cepted another man in the presence of her husband. According to Vedic
culture, even if a young woman is given an old husband, she must re-
spectfully serve him. This is chastity. It is not that because she dislikes
her husband she may give him up and accept another. This is against
Vedic culture. According to Vedic culture, a woman must accept the hus-
band given to her by her parents and remain chaste and faithful to him.
Therefore King Saryati was surprised to see a young man by the side of
Sukanya.

--- Page 77 ---
Text 22] The Marriage of Sukanya and Cyavana Muni 73
you are shamelessly maintaining a paramour? You will thus
degrade the dynasties of both your father and your husband to
hellish life.
PURPORT
It is quite clear that according to Vedic culture a woman who accepts a
paramour or second husband in the presence of the husband she has
married is certainly responsible for the degradation of her father’s
family and the family of her husband. The rules of Vedic culture in this
regard are strictly observed in the respectable families of brahmanas,
ksatriyas and vaiSyas even today; only the Siidras are degraded in this
matter. For a woman of the brahmana, ksatriya or vaisya class to accept
another husband in the presence of the husband she has married, or to
file for divorce or accept a boyfriend or paramour, is unacceptable in the
Vedic culture. Therefore King Saryati, who did not know the real facts of
Cyavana Muni’s transformation, was surprised to see the behavior of his
daughter.

“My dear father, this young man by my side is your actual son-in-
law, the great sage Cyavana, who was born in the family of Bhrgu.”
PURPORT
Although the father chastised the daughter, assuming that she had ac-
cepted another husband, the daughter knew that she was completely
honest and chaste, and therefore she was smiling. When she explained
that her husband, Cyavana Muni, had now been transformed into a
young man, she was very proud of her chastity, and thus she smiled as
she talked with her father.

TRANSLATION
Twenty-seven catur-yugas have already passed. Those upon
whom you may have decided are now gone, and so are their sons,
grandsons and other descendants. You cannot even hear about
their names.
PURPORT
During Lord Brahma’s day, fourteen Manus or one thousand maha-
yugas pass away. Brahma informed King Kakudmi that twenty-seven
mahd-yugas, each consisting of the four periods Satya, Treta, Dvapara
and Kali, had already passed. All the kings and other great personalities
born in those yugas had now departed from memory into obscurity. This
is the way of time as it moves through past, present and future.

CHAPTER FOUR
Ambarisa Maharaja
Offended by Durvasa Muni
This chapter describes the history of Maharaja Nabhaga, of his son
Nabhaga, and of Maharaja Ambarisa.

The son of Manu was Nabhaga, and his son Nabhaga lived for many
years in the gurukula. In Nabhaga’s absence, his brothers did not con-
sider his share of the kingdom, but instead divided the property among
themselves. When Nabhaga returned home, his brothers bestowed upon
him their father as his share, but when Nabhaga went to his father and
told him about the dealings of the brothers, his father informed him that
this was cheating and advised him that for his livelihood he should go to
the sacrificial arena and describe two mantras to be chanted there.
Nabhaga executed the order of his father, and thus Angira and other
great saintly persons gave him all the money collected in that sacrifice.
To test Nabhaga, Lord Siva challenged his claim to the wealth, but when
Lord Siva was satisfied by Nabhaga’s behavior, Lord Siva offered him all
the riches.

From Nabhaga was born Ambarisa, the most powerful and celebrated
devotee. Maharaja Ambarisa was the emperor of the entire world, but he
considered his opulence temporary. Indeed, knowing that such material
opulence is the cause of downfall into conditional life, he was unattached
to this opulence. He engaged his senses and mind in the service of the
Lord. This process is called yukta-vairagya, or feasible renunciation,
which is quite suitable for worship of the Supreme Personality of God-
head. Because Maharaja Ambarisa, as the emperor, was immensely opu-
lent, he performed devotional service with great opulence, and therefore,
despite his wealth, he had no attachment to his wife, children or
kingdom. He constantly engaged his senses and mind in the service of
the Lord. Therefore, to say nothing of enjoying material opulence, he
never desired even liberation.

Once Maharaja Ambarisa was worshiping the Supreme Personality of
Godhead in Vrndavana, observing the vow of Dvadasi. On Dvadasi, the

85


--- Page 89 ---
86 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 4
day after Ekadasi, when he was about to break his Ekadasi fast, the great
mystic yogi Durvasa appeared in his house and became his guest. King
Ambarisa respectfully received Durvasa Muni, and Durvasa Muni, after
accepting his invitation to eat there, went to bathe in the Yamuna River
at noontime. Because he was absorbed in samadhi, he did not come back
very soon. Maharaja Ambarisa, however, upon seeing that the time to
break the fast was passing, drank a little water, in accordance with the
advice of learned brahmanas, just to observe the formality of breaking
the fast. By mystic power, Durvasa Muni could understand that this had
happened, and he was very angry. When he returned he began to
chastise Maharaja Ambarisa, but he was not satisfied, and finally he cre-
ated from his hair a demon appearing like the fire of death. The Supreme
Personality of Godhead, however, is always the protector of His devotee,
and to protect Maharaja Ambarisa, He sent His disc, the Sudar$ana cakra,
which immediately vanquished the fiery demon and then pursued
Durvasa, who was so envious of Maharaja Ambarisa. Durvasa fled to
Brahmaloka, Sivaloka and all the other higher planets, but he could not
protect himself from the wrath of the Sudar$ana cakra. Finally he went
to the spiritual world and surrendered to Lord Narayana, but Lord
Narayana could not excuse a person who had offended a Vaisnava. To be
excused from such an offense, one must submit to the Vaisnava whom he
has offended. There is no other way to be excused. Thus Lord Narayana
advised Durvisa to return to Maharaja Ambarisa and beg his pardon.

sri-sukah uvaca—Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said; nabhagah—Nabhaga;
nabhaga-apatyam—was the son of Maharaja Nabhaga; yam —unto
whom; tatam—the father; bhratarah—the elder brothers; kavim—the
learned; yavistham—the youngest; vyabhajan—divided; dayam—the
property; brahmacarinam—having accepted the life of a brahmacari
perpetually (naisthika); agatam—returned.

TRANSLATION

Sukadeva Gosvami said: The son of Nabhaga named Nabhaga
lived for a long time at the place of his spiritual master. Therefore,
his brothers thought that he was not going to become a grhastha
and would not return. Consequently, without providing a share
for him, they divided the property of their father among them-
selves. When Nabhaga returned from the place of his spiritual
master, they gave him their father as his share.

PURPORT

There are two kinds of brahmacaris. One may return home, marry
and become a householder, whereas the other, known as brhad-vrata,
takes a vow to remain a brahmacari perpetually. The brhad-vrata
brahmacari does not return from the place of the spiritual master; he
stays there, and later he directly takes sannyasa. Because Nabhaga did
not return from the place of his spiritual master, his brothers thought
that he had taken brhadvrata-brahmacarya. Therefore, they did not
preserve his share, and when he returned they gave him their father as
his share.

answered, “We have kept our father as your share.” But when
Nabhaga went to his father and said, “My dear father, my elder
brothers have given you as my share of property,” the father
replied, ‘““My dear son, do not rely upon their cheating words. I am
not your property.”

PURPORT
Nabhiaga was very simple hearted. Therefore when he went to his
father, the father, in compassion for his son, suggested that as a means of
livelihood Nabhaga could go to the descendants of Angira and take ad-
vantage of their misgivings in performing yajnia.

Nabhaga’s father continued: “Go to those great souls and de-
scribe two Vedic hymns pertaining to Vaisvadeva. When the great
sages have completed the sacrifice and are going to the heavenly
planets, they will give you the remnants of the money they have
received from the sacrifice. Therefore, go there immediately.”
Thus Nabhaga acted exactly according to the advice of his father,
and the great sages of the Angira dynasty gave him all their wealth
and then went to the heavenly planets.

Sukadeva Gosvami said: Maharaja Ambarisa, the most fortunate
personality, achieved the rule of the entire world, consisting of
seven islands, and achieved inexhaustible, unlimited opulence and
prosperity on earth. Although such a position is rarely obtained,
Maharaja Ambarisa did not care for it at all, for he knew very well
that all such opulence is material. Like that which is imagined in a
dream, such opulence will ultimately be destroyed. The King knew
that any nondevotee who attains such opulence merges in-
creasingly into material nature’s mode of darkness.
PURPORT
For a devotee material opulence is insignificant, whereas for a non-
devotee material opulence is the cause of increasing bondage, for a

opulence is a disqualification for spiritual advancement.

TRANSLATION

Maharaja Ambarisa always engaged his mind in meditating upon
the lotus feet of Krsna, his words in describing the glories of the
Lord, his hands in cleansing the Lord’s temple, and his ears in
hearing the words spoken by Krsna or about Krsna. He engaged
his eyes in seeing the Deity of Krsna, Krsna’s temples and Krsna’s
places like Mathura and Vrndavana, he engaged his sense of touch
in touching the bodies of the Lord’s devotees, he engaged his
sense of smell in smelling the fragrance of tulasi offered to the
Lord, and he engaged his tongue in tasting the Lord’s prasada. He
engaged his legs in walking to the holy places and temples of the
Lord, his head in bowing down before the Lord, and all his desires
in serving the Lord, twenty-four hours a day. Indeed, Maharaja
Ambarisa never desired anything for his own sense gratification.
He engaged all his senses in devotional service, in various engage-
ments related to the Lord. This is the way to increase attachment
for the Lord and be completely free from all material desires.

PURPORT

In Bhagavad-gita (7.1) the Lord recommends, mayy dsakta-manah
partha yogam yufijan mad-dsrayah. This indicates that one must exe-
cute devotional service under the guidance of a devotee or directly under
the guidance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is not possible,


--- Page 103 ---
100 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 4
however, to train oneself without guidance from the spiritual master.
Therefore, according to the instructions of Srila Ripa Gosvami, the first
business of a devotee is to accept a bona fide spiritual master who can
train him to engage his various senses in rendering transcendental ser-
vice to the Lord. The Lord also says in Bhagavad-gita (7.1), asamsayarir
samagrari mdr yatha jidsyasi tac chrnu. In other words, if one wants to
understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead in completeness, one
must follow the prescriptions given by Krsna by following in the
footsteps of Maharaja Ambarisa. It is said, hrstkena hrsikesa-sevanarn
bhaktir ucyate: bhakti means to engage the senses in the service of
the master of the senses, Krsna, who is called Hrsikesa or Acyuta.
These words are used in these verses. Acyuta-sat-kathodaye, hrsikesa-
padabhivandane. The words Acyuta and Hrsikesa are also used in
Bhagavad-gita. Bhagavad-gita is krsna-katha spoken directly by Krsna,
and Srimad-Bhagavatam is also krsna-katha because everything de-
scribed in the Bhagavatam is in relationship with Krsna.

TRANSLATION
In performing his prescribed duties as king, Maharaja Ambarisa
always offered the results of his royal activities to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Krsna, who is the enjoyer of everything
and is beyond the perception of material senses. He certainly took
advice from brahmanas who were faithful devotees of the Lord,
and thus he ruled the planet earth without difficulty.
PURPORT
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (5.29):
bhoktararm yajiia-tapasarn
sarva-loka-mahesvaram
suhrdari sarva-bhiitanam
JjAatva marn santim rcchati
People are very much anxious to live in peace and prosperity in this
material world, and here in Bhagavad-gita the peace formula is given
personally by the Supreme Personality of Godhead: everyone should
understand that Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the ulti-
mate proprietor of all the planets and is therefore the enjoyer of all ac-
tivities, political, social, cultural, religious, economic and so on. The Lord
has given perfect advice in Bhagavad-gita, and Ambarisa Maharaja, as
the ideal executive head, ruled the entire world as a Vaisnava, taking ad-
vice from Vaisnava brahmanas. The 3astras enjoin that even though a
brahmana may be well versed in the occupational brahminical duties and
may be very learned in Vedic knowledge, he cannot give advice as a guru
until he is a Vaisnava.

102 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 4
Therefore, as indicated here by the words tan-nistha-viprabhihitah,
Maharaja Ambarisa took advice from brahmanas who were pure
devotees of the Lord, for ordinary brahmanas who are merely
learned scholars or experts in performing ritualistic ceremonies are not
competent to give advice.

In modern times, there are legislative assemblies whose members are
authorized to make laws for the welfare of the state, but according to this
description of the kingdom of Maharaja Ambarisa, the country or the
world should be ruled by a chief executive whose advisors are all devotee
brahmanas. Such advisors or members of the legislative assembly should
not be professional politicians, nor should they be selected by the ig-
norant public. Rather, they should be appointed by the king. When the
king, the executive head of the state, is a devotee and he follows the in-
structions of devotee brahmanas in ruling the country, everyone will be
peaceful and prosperous. When the king and his advisors are per-
fect devotees, nothing can be wrong in the state. All the citizens should
become devotees of the Lord, and then their good character will
automatically follow.

yasyasti bhaktir bhagavaty akificana
sarvair gunais tatra samasate surah
harav abhaktasya kuto mahad-guna

“One who has unflinching devotion for the Personality of Godhead has
all the good qualities of the demigods. But one who is not a devotee of the
Lord has only material qualifications that are of little value. This is be-
cause he is hovering on the mental plane and is certain to be attracted by
the glaring material energy.” (Bhag. 5.18.12) Citizens under the guid-
ance of a Krsna conscious king will become devotees, and then there will
be no need to enact new laws every day to reform the way of life in the
state. If the citizens are trained to become devotees, they will auto-
matically become peaceful and honest, and if they are guided by a de-
voted king advised by devotees, the state will not be in the material world
but in the spiritual world. All the states of the world should therefore
follow the ideal of the rule or administration of Maharaja Ambarisa, as
described here.

TRANSLATION
In desert countries where there flowed the River Sarasvati,
Maharaja Ambarisa performed great sacrifices like the aSvamedha-
yajiia and thus satisfied the master of all yajiias, the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead. Such sacrifices were performed with great
opulence and suitable paraphernalia and with contributions of
daksina to the brahmanas, who were supervised by great per-
sonalities like Vasistha, Asita and Gautama, representing the king,
the performer of the sacrifices.
PURPORT
When one performs ritualistic sacrifices as prescribed in the Vedas,
one needs expert brahmanas known as yajaika-brahmanas. In Kali-
yuga, however, there is a scarcity of such brahmanas. Therefore in


--- Page 107 ---
104 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 4
Kali-yuga the sacrifice recommended in S$astra is sarkirtana-yajia
(yajiiaih sarkirtana-prayair yajanti hi sumedhasah). Instead of spend-
ing money unnecessarily on performing yajiias impossible to perform in
this age of Kali because of the scarcity of yajiiika-brahmanas, one who is
intelligent performs sarikirtana-yajia. Without properly performed
yajiias to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there will be scar-
city of rain (yajiiad bhavati parjanyah). Therefore the performance of
yajnia is essential. Without yajria there will be a scarcity of rain, and be-
cause of this scarcity, no food grains will be produced, and there will be
famines. It is the duty of the king, therefore, to perform different types
of yajiias, such as the asvamedha-yajiia, to maintain the production of
food grains. Annad bhavanti bhiatani. Without food grains, both men
and animals will starve. Therefore yajiia is necessary for the state to per-
form because by yajiia the people in general will be fed sumptuously.
The brahmanas and yajiika priests should be sufficiently paid for their
expert service. This payment is called daksind. Ambarisa Maharaja, as
the head of the state, performed all these yajiias through great per-
sonalities like Vasistha, Gautama and Asita. Personally, however, he was
engaged in devotional service, as mentioned before (sa vai manah krsna-
padaravindayoh). The king or head of state must see that things go on
well under proper guidance, and he must be an ideal devotee, as ex-
emplified by Maharaja Ambarisa. It is the duty of the king to see that
food grains are produced even in desert countries, what to speak of
elsewhere.

The citizens of the state of Maharaja Ambarisa were accustomed
to chanting and hearing about the glorious activities of the Per-
sonality of Godhead. Thus they never aspired to be elevated to the
heavenly planets, which are extremely dear even to the demigods.
PURPORT
A pure devotee who has been trained in the practice of chanting and
hearing the holy name of the Lord and His fame, qualities, form,

“Devotees solely engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead, Narayana, never fear any condition of life. The
heavenly planets, liberation and the hellish planets are all the same to a
devotee.” (Bhag. 6.17.28) A devotee is always situated in the spiritual
world. Therefore he does not desire anything. He is known as akama, or
desireless, because he has nothing to desire except to render transcen-
dental loving service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because
Maharaja Ambarisa was a most exalted devotee of the Lord, he trained
his subjects in such a way that the citizens in his state were not interested
in anything material, including even the happiness of the heavenly
planets.

TRANSLATION
Those who are saturated with the transcendental happiness of
rendering service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead are un-
interested even in the achievements of great mystics, for such
achievements do not enhance the transcendental bliss felt by a
devotee who always thinks of Krsna within the core of his heart.
PURPORT
A pure devotee is uninterested not only in elevation to the higher
planetary systems but even in the perfections of mystic yoga. Real per-
fection is devotional service. The happiness derived from merging in the
impersonal Brahman and the happiness derived from the eight perfec-
tions of mystic yoga (anima, laghima, prapti and so on) do not give any
pleasure to the devotee. As stated by Srila Prabodhananda Sarasvati:
kaivalyar narakayate tridasa-pir akasa-puspayate
durdantendriya-kala-sarpa-patali protkhata-damstrayate
एषा, purna-sukhdayate vidhi-mahendradis ca kitayate
yat karunya-kataksa-vaibhavavatam tam gauram eva stumah
(Caitanya-candramrta 5)
When a devotee has achieved the position of rendering transcendental
loving service to the Lord through the mercy of Lord Caitanya, he thinks
the impersonal Brahman to be no better than hell, and he regards ma-
terial happiness in the heavenly planets to be like a will-o’-the-wisp. As
far as the perfection of mystic powers is concerned, a devotee compares it
to a venomous snake with no teeth. A mystic yogi is especially concerned
with controlling the senses, but because the senses of a devotee are
engaged in the service of the Lord (hrsikena hrsikesa-sevanari bhaktir
ucyate) there is no need for separate control of the senses. For those who
are materially engaged, control of the senses is required, but a devotee’s
senses are all engaged in the service of the Lord, which means that they


--- Page 111 ---
108 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 4
are already controlled. Param drstva nivartate (Bg. 2.59). A devotee’s
senses are not attracted by material enjoyment. And even though the ma-
terial world is full of misery, the devotee considers this material world to
be also spiritual because everything is engaged in the service of the Lord.
The difference between the spiritual world and material world is the
mentality of service. Nirbandhah krsna-sambandhe yuktarh vairagyam
ucyate. When there is no mentality of service to the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, one’s activities are material.
prapaiici-kataya buddhya
hari-sambandhi-vastunah
mumuksubhih parityago
vairagyarm phalgu kathyate
(Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 1.2.256)
That which is not engaged in the service of the Lord is material, and
nothing thus engaged should be given up. In the construction of a high
skyscraper and the construction of a temple, there may be the same en-
thusiasm, but the endeavors are different, for one is material and the
other spiritual. Spiritual activities should not be confused with material
activities and given up. Nothing connected with Hari, the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead, is material. A devotee who considers all this is al-
ways situated in spiritual activities, and therefore he is no longer
attracted by material activities (param drstva nivartate).

TRANSLATION

The king of this planet, Maharaja Ambarisa, thus performed de-
votional service to the Lord and in this endeavor practiced severe
austerity. Always satisfying the Supreme Personality of Godhead
by his constitutional activities, he gradually gave up all material
desires.

PURPORT

Severe austerities in the practice of devotional service are of many
varieties. For example, in worshiping the Deity in the temple there are
certainly laborious activities. Sri-vigraharadhana-nitya-nana-srngara-
tan-mandira-marjanddau. One must decorate the Deity, cleanse the
temple, bring water from the Ganges and Yamuna, continue the routine
work, perform @rati many times, prepare first-class food for the Deity,
prepare dresses and so on. In this way, one must constantly be engaged in
various activities, and the hard labor involved is certainly an austerity.
Similarly, the hard labor involved in preaching, preparing literature,
preaching to atheistic men and distributing literature door to door is of
course an austerity (tapo-yuktena). Tapo divyar putraka. Such austerity
is necessary. Yena sattvari Suddhyet. By such austerity in devotional ser-
vice, one is purified of material existence (kaman sanair jahau). Indeed,
such austerity leads one to the constitutional position of devotional ser-
vice. In this way one can give up material desires, and as soon as one is
freed from material desires, he is free from the repetition of birth and
death, old age and disease.

effect of bhakti-yoga. Bhaktih paresanubhavo viraktir anyatra ca

A devotee, being always engaged in the service of the Lord, may not be
expert in self-defense, but because a devotee fully depends on the lotus
feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is always sure of protec-
tion by the Lord. Prahlada Maharaja said:

A devotee is always merged in the ocean of the transcendental bliss of

adverse situation in the material world. The Lord also promises, kaun-
teya pratijanihi na me bhaktah pranasyati: “0 Arjuna, you may declare
to the world that the devotees of the Lord are never vanquished.”
(Bg. 9.31) For the protection of the devotees, Krsna’s disc, the
Sudars$ana cakra, 15 always ready. This disc is extremely fearful to the
nondevotees (pratyanika-bhayavaham). Therefore although Maharaja
Ambarisa was fully engaged in devotional service, his kingdom was free
of all fear of adversity.

To worship Lord Krsna, Maharaja Ambarisa, along with his

PURPORT
To observe Ekadasi-vrata and DviadaSi-vrata means to please the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Those interested in advancing in
Krsna consciousness must observe Ekadadi-vrata regularly. Maharaja
Ambarisa’s queen was equally as qualified as the King. Therefore it was
possible for Maharaja Ambarisa to engage his life in household affairs. In
this regard, the word tulya-silaya is very significant. Unless a wife is

Text 30] Ambarisa Maharaja Offended by Durvasa Muni 113
equally as qualified as her husband, household affairs are very difficult
to continue. Canakya Pandita advises that a person in such a situation
should immediately give up household life and become a vanaprastha or
sannyasi:
mata yasya grhe nasti
bharya capriya-vadini
aranyam tena gantavyarm
yatharanyar tatha grham
A person who has no mother at home and whose wife is not agreeable
with him should immediately go away to the forest. Because human life
is meant for spiritual advancement only, one’s wife must be helpful in
this endeavor. Otherwise there is no need of household life.

Thereafter, Maharaja Ambarisa satisfied all the guests who ar-

sixty crores of cows whose horns were covered with gold plate and
whose hooves were covered with silver plate. All the cows were
well decorated with garments and had full milk bags. They were
mild-natured, young and beautiful and were accompanied by their
calves. After giving these cows, the King first sumptuously fed all
the brahmanas, and when they were fully satisfied, he was about to
observe the end of Ekadasi, with their permission, by breaking the
fast. Exactly at that time, however, Durvasa Muni, the great and
powerful mystic, appeared on the scene as an uninvited guest.

The King said: *““To transgress the laws of respectful behavior

hand, if one does not observe the breaking of the fast within the
time of Dvada$i, there is a flaw in one’s observance of the vow.
Therefore, O brahmanas, if you think that it will be auspicious and
not irreligious, I shall break the fast by drinking water.” In this
way, after consulting with the brahmanas, the King reached this
decision, for according to brahminical opinion, drinking water
may be accepted as eating and also as not eating.
PURPORT

When Maharaja Ambarisa, in his dilemma, consulted the brahmanas
about whether he should break the fast or wait for Durvasa Muni, ap-
parently they could not give a definite answer about what to do. A
Vaisnava, however, is the most intelligent personality. Therefore
Maharaja Ambarisa himself decided, in the presence of the brahmanas,
that he would drink a little water, for this would confirm that the fast
was broken but would not transgress the laws for receiving a brahmana.
In the Vedas it is said, apo ’Snati tan 78080588077 naivanasitam. This
Vedic injunction declares that the drinking of water may be accepted as
eating or as not eating. Sometimes in our practical experience we see that
some political leader adhering to satyagraha will not eat but will drink
water. Considering that drinking water would not be eating, Maharaja
Ambarisa decided to act in this way.

his position, he considers himself God. Just see how he has
transgressed the laws of religion.
PURPORT

Srila Vigvanatha Cakravarti Thakura has diverted the entire meaning
of this verse as spoken by Durvasa Muni. Durvasa Muni used the word
nr-sarisasya to indicate that the King was cruel, but Visvanitha
Cakravarti Thakura interprets it to mean that the King’s character was
glorified by all the local people. He says that the word nr means “by all
the local people” and that Samsasya means “01 he (Ambarisa) whose
character was glorified.” Similarly, one who is very rich becomes mad
because of his wealth and is therefore called sriya-unmattasya, but Srila
Viévanatha Cakravarti Thikura interprets these words to mean that al-
though Maharija Ambarisa was such an opulent king, he was not mad
after money, for he had already surpassed the madness of material opu-
lence. Similarly, the word #a-maninah is interpreted to mean that he
was so respectful to the Supreme Personality of Godhead that he did not
transgress the laws for observing Ekadasi-parana, despite the thinking of
Durvasa Muni, for he only took water. In this way, Srila Vi$vanatha
Cakravarti Thakura has supported Ambarisa Maharaja and all his
activities.

stead of feeding me, you yourself have eaten first. Because of your

PURPORT
A devotee cannot be defeated by a so-called mystic yogi. This will be
proved by the failure of Durvasa Muni’s endeavor to chastise Maharaja
Ambarisa. Harav abhaktasya kuto mahad-gunah (Bhag. 5.18.12). One
who is not a pure devotee of the Supreme Lord has no good qualifica-
tions, however great a mystic, philosopher or fruitive worker he may be.
Only a devotee emerges victorious in all circumstances, as will be shown
in this incident involving the rivalry between Durvasa and Maharaja
Ambarisa.

pure devotee of Narayana is never afraid of any material danger. There
are many examples of devotees such as Prahlada Maharaja, who was tor-
tured by his father but was not at all afraid, although he was only a five-
year-old boy. Therefore, following the examples of Ambarisa Maharaja
and Prahlada Maharaja, a devotee should learn how to tolerate all such
awkward positions in this world. Devotees are often tortured by non-
devotees, yet the pure devotee, depending fully on the mercy of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, is never disturbed by such inimical
activities.

As fire in the forest immediately burns to ashes an angry snake,
so, by the previous order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
His disc, the Sudar$ana cakra, immediately burnt to ashes the cre-
ated demon to protect the Lord’s devotee.

PURPORT

As a pure devotee, Maharaja Ambarisa, although in such danger, did
not move an inch from his position, nor did he request the Supreme
Personality of Godhead to give him protection. He was fixed in under-
standing, and it was certain that he was simply thinking of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead in the core of his heart. A devotee is never fear-
ful of his death, for he meditates on the Supreme Personality of Godhead
always, not for any material profit, but as his duty. The Lord, however,
knows how to protect His devotee. As indicated by the words prag
distamn, the Lord knew everything. Therefore, before anything hap-
pened, He had already arranged for His cakra to protect Maharaja
Ambarisa. This protection is offered to a devotee even from the very
beginning of his devotional service. Kaunteya pratijanihi na me bhaktah
pranasyati (Bg. 9.31). If one simply begins devotional service, he is im-
mediately protected by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is also
confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (18.66): aham (षठा sarva-papebhyo
moksayisyami. Protection begins immediately. The Lord is so kind and
merciful that He gives the devotee proper guidance and all protection,
and thus the devotee very peacefully makes solid progress in Krsna

consciousness without outward disturbances. A serpent may be very
angry and ready to bite, but the furious snake is helpless when faced by a
blazing fire in the forest. Although an enemy of a devotee may be very
strong, he is compared to an angry serpent before the fire of devotional
service.

With a fearful heart, Durvasa Muni went here and there seeking

TRANSLATION

Lord Brahma said: At the end of the dvi-parardha, when the
pastimes of the Lord come to an end, Lord Visnu, by a flick of His
eyebrows, vanquishes the entire universe, including our places of
residence. Such personalities as me and Lord Siva, as well as Daksa,
Bhrgu and similar great saints of which they are the head, and also
the rulers of the living entities, the rulers of human society and
the rulers of the demigods—all of us surrender to that Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Lord Visnu, bowing our heads, to carry
out His orders for the benefit of all living entities.

PURPORT

In Bhagavad-gita (10.34) it is said, mrtyuh sarva-haras caham: when
the Supreme Personality of Godhead approaches as death, or the
supreme controller of time, He takes everything away. In other words, all
opulence, prestige and everything we possess is given by the Supreme
Lord for some purpose. It is the duty of the surrendered soul to execute
the orders of the Supreme. No one can disregard Him. Under the circum-
stances, Lord Brahma refused to give shelter to Durvasa Muni from the
powerful Sudarsana cakra sent by the Lord.

PURPORT
There are innumerable universes in the material world, and there are
innumerable Lord Brahmas, Lord Sivas and other demigods. All of them
rotate within this material world under the supreme direction of the Per-
sonality of Godhead. Therefore no one is able to compete with the
strength of the Lord. Lord Siva also refused to protect Durvasa, for Lord
Siva also was under the rays of the Sudarsana cakra sent by the Supreme
Personality of Godhead.

Text 64] Ambarisa Maharaja Offended by Durvasa Muni 137
PURPORT

All the great stalwart personalities in the universe, including Lord
Brahma and Lord Siva, are fully under the control of the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead, but the Supreme Personality of Godhead is fully
under the control of His devotee. Why is this? Because the devotee is
anyabhilasita-sanya; in other words, he has no material desires in his
heart. His only desire is to think always of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead and how to serve Him best. Because of this transcendental
qualification, the Supreme Lord is extremely favorable to the devotees —
indeed, not only the devotees, but also the devotees of the devotees. Srila
Narottama dasa Thakura says, chadiya vaisnava-seva nistara payeche
keba: without being a devotee of a devotee, one cannot be released from
material entanglement. Therefore Caitanya Mahaprabhu identified Him-
self as gopi-bhartuh pada-kamalayor dasa-dasanuddsah. Thus he in-
structed us to become not directly servants of Krsna but servants of the
servant of Krsna. Devotees like Brahma, Narada, Vyasadeva and
Sukadeva Gosvami are directly servants of Krsna, and one who becomes
a servant of Narada, Vyasadeva and Sukadeva, like the six Gosvamis, is
still more devoted. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura therefore says,
yasya prasadad bhagavat-prasadah: if one very sincerely serves the
spiritual master, Krsna certainly becomes favorable to such a devotee.
Following the instructions of a devotee is more valuable than following
the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead directly.

TRANSLATION

O best of the brahmanas, without saintly persons for whom I am
the only destination, I do not desire to enjoy My transcendental
bliss and My supreme opulences.

PURPORT

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is self-sufficient, but to enjoy
His transcendental bliss He requires the cooperation of His devotees. In
Vrndavana, for example, although Lord Krsna is full in Himself, He
wants the cooperation of His devotees like the cowherd boys and the
gopis to increase His transcendental bliss. Such pure devotees, who can
increase the pleasure potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
are certainly most dear to Him. Not only does the Supreme Personality of
Godhead enjoy the company of His devotees, but because He is unlimited
He wants to increase His devotees unlimitedly. Thus, He descends to the
material world to induce the nondevotees and rebellious living entities to
return home, back to Godhead. He requests them to surrender unto Him
because, unlimited as He is, He wants to increase His devotees un-
limitedly. The Krsna consciousness movement is an attempt to increase
the number of pure devotees of the Supreme Lord more and more. It is
certain that a devotee who helps in this endeavor to satisfy the Supreme
Personality of Godhead becomes indirectly a controller of the Supreme
Lord. Although the Supreme Lord is full in six opulences, He does not
feel transcendental bliss without His devotees. An example that may be
cited in this regard is that if a very rich man does not have sons in a
family he does not feel happiness. Indeed, sometimes a rich man adopts a
son to complete his happiness. The science of transcendental bliss is
known to the pure devotee. Therefore the pure devotee is always
engaged in increasing the transcendental happiness of the Lord.

TRANSLATION

Since pure devotees give up their homes, wives, children, rela-
tives, riches and even their lives simply to serve Me, without any
desire for material improvement in this life or in the next, how
can I give up such devotees at any time?

PURPORT

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshiped by the words
brahmanya-devaya go-brahmana-hitaya ca. Thus He is the well-wisher
of the brahmanas. Durvasa Muni was certainly a very great brahmana,
but because he was a nondevotee, he could not sacrifice everything in de-
votional service. Great mystic yogis are actually self-interested. The
proof is that when Durvasa Muni created a demon to kill Maharaja
Ambarisa, the King stayed fixed in his place, praying to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead and depending solely and wholly on Him,
whereas when Durviasa Muni was chased by the Sudarsana cakra by the
supreme will of the Lord, he was so perturbed that he fled all over the
world and tried to take shelter in every nook and corner of the universe.
At last, in fear of his life, he approached Lord Brahma, Lord Siva and
ultimately the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He was so interested in
his own body that he wanted to kill the body of a Vaisnava. Therefore, he
did not have very good intelligence, and how can an unintelligent person
be delivered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead? The Lord certainly


--- Page 143 ---
140 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 4
tries to give all protection to His devotees who have given up everything
for the sake of serving Him.

Another point in this verse is that attachment to daragara-putrapta—
home, wife, children, friendship, society and love—is not the way to
achieve the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who is at-
tached to hearth and home for material pleasure cannot become a pure
devotee. Sometimes a pure devotee may have a habit or attraction for
wife, children and home but at the same time want to serve the Supreme
Lord to the best of his ability. For such a devotee, the Lord makes a
special arrangement to take away the objects of his false attachment and
thus free him from attachment to wife, home, children, friends and so
on. This is special mercy bestowed upon the devotee to bring him back
home, back to Godhead.

Text 67] Ambarisa Maharaja Offended by Durvasa Muni 141
PURPORT
In this verse, the word sama-darsanah is significant. The pure devotee
is actually equal toward everyone, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita
(18.54): brahma-bhitah prasannatma na Socati na kanksati/ samah
sarvesu bhittesu. Universal brotherhood is possible when one is a pure
devotee (panditah sama-darsinah). A pure devotee is actually learned
because he knows his constitutional position, he knows the position of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, and he knows the relationship between
the living entity and the Supreme Lord. Thus he has full spiritual knowl-
edge and is automatically liberated (brahma-bhiitah). He can therefore
see everyone on the spiritual platform. He can comprehend the happi-
ness and distress of all living entities. He understands that what is happi-
ness to him is also happiness to others and that what is distress to him is
distressing for others. Therefore he is sympathetic to everyone. As
Prahlada Maharaja said:
Soce tato vimukha-cetasa indriyartha-
maya-sukhdya bharam udvahato vimidhan
(Bhag. 7.9.43)
People suffer from material distress because they are not attached to the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. A pure devotee’s chief concern,
therefore, is to raise the ignorant mass of people to the sense of Krsna
consciousness.

My devotees, who are always satisfied to be engaged in My loving
service, are not interested even in the four principles of liberation
[salokya, saripya, samipya and sarsti], although these are auto-
matically achieved by their service. What then is to be said of such
perishable happiness as elevation to the higher planetary systems?
PURPORT
Srila Bilvamangala Thiakura has estimated the value of liberation as
follows:
muktih svayarn mukulitanjalih sevate ’sman
dharmartha-kima-gatayah samaya-pratiksah
Bilvamangala Thakura realized that if one develops his natural devo-
tional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, mukti stands
before him with folded hands to offer all kinds of service. In other
words, the devotee is already liberated. There is no need for him to
aspire for different types of liberation. The pure devotee automatically
achieves liberation, even without desiring it.

TRANSLATION

The pure devotee is always within the core of My heart, and I am
always in the heart of the pure devotee. My devotees do not know
anything else but Me, and I do not know anyone else but them.
PURPORT
Since Durvasa Muni wanted to chastise Maharaja Ambarisa, it is to be
understood that he wanted to give pain to the heart of the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead, for the Lord says, sadhavo hrdayarih mahyam:
“The pure devotee is always within the core of My heart.” The Lord’s
feelings are like those of a father, who feels pain when his child is in
pain. Therefore, offenses at the lotus feet of a devotee are serious.
Caitanya Mahaprabhu has very strongly recommended that one not com-
mit any offense at the lotus feet of a devotee. Such offenses are compared
to a mad elephant because when a mad elephant enters a garden it causes
devastation. Therefore one should be extremely careful not to commit
offenses at the lotus feet of a pure devotee. Actually Maharaja Ambarisa
was not at all at fault; Durvasi Muni unnecessarily wanted to chastise
him on flimsy grounds. Maharaja Ambarisa wanted to complete the
Ekadasi-parana as part of devotional service to please the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead, and therefore he drank a little water. But although
Durvasa Muni was a great mystic brahmana, he did not know what is
what. That is the difference between a pure devotee and a so-called
learned scholar of Vedic knowledge. The devotees, being always situated
in the core of the Lord’s heart, surely get all instructions directly from
the Lord, as confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gita (10.11):
tesam evanukampartham
aham ajfidnajari tamah
nasayamy atma-bhavastho
jAana-dipena bhasvata

the shining lamp of knowledge the darkness born of ignorance.” The
devotee does not do anything not sanctioned by the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. As it is said, vaisnavera kriya mudra vijiieha na bujhaya.
Even the most learned or experienced person cannot understand the
movements of a Vaisnava, a pure devotee. No one, therefore, should
criticize a pure Vaisnava. A Vaisnava knows his own business; whatever
he does is precisely right because he is always guided by the Supreme
Personality of Godhead.

O brahmana, let Me now advise you for your own protection.
Please hear from Me. By offending Maharaja Ambarisa, you have

acted with self-envy. Therefore you should go to him immediately,
without a moment’s delay. One’s so-called prowess, when em-
ployed against the devotee, certainly harms he who employs it.
Thus it is the subject, not the object, who is harmed.
PURPORT

A Vaisnava is always an object of envy for nondevotees, even when the
nondevotee happens to be his father. To give a practical example,
Hiranyakasipu was envious of Prahlada Maharaja, but this envy of the
devotee was harmful to Hiranyakasipu, not to Prahlada. Every action
taken by Hiranyakasipu against his son Prahlada Maharaja was taken
very seriously by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thus when
Hiranyakasipu was on the verge of killing Prahlada, the Lord personally
appeared and killed Hiranyakasipu. Service to a Vaisnava gradually ac-
cumulates and becomes an asset for the devotee. Similarly, harmful ac-
tivities directed against the devotee gradually become the ultimate cause
of the performer’s falldown. Even such a great brahmana and mystic
yogi as Durvasa was in a most dangerous situation because of his offense
at the lotus feet of Maharaja Ambarisa, a pure devotee.

TRANSLATION

For a brahmana, austerity and learning are certainly auspicious,
but when acquired by a person who is not gentle, such austerity
and learning are most dangerous.

PURPORT

It is said that a jewel is very valuable, but when it is on the hood of a
serpent, it is dangerous despite its value. Similarly, when a materialistic
nondevotee achieves great success in learning and austerity, that success
is dangerous for all of society. So-called learned scientists, for example,
invented atomic weapons that are dangerous for all humanity. It is
therefore said, manina bhisitah sarpah kim asau na bhayankarah. A
serpent with a jewel on its hood is as dangerous as a serpent without such
a jewel. Durvasa Muni was a very learned brahmana equipped with
mystic power, but because he was not a gentleman, he did not know how
to use his power. He was therefore extremely dangerous. The Supreme
Personality of Godhead is never inclined toward a dangerous person who
uses his mystic power for some personal design. By the laws of nature,
therefore, such misuse of power is ultimately dangerous not for society
but for the person who misuses it.

The lesson to be derived from this narration concerning Maharaja
Ambarisa and Durvasa Muni is that all the demigods, including Lord


--- Page 151 ---
148 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 4
Brahma and Lord Siva, are under the control of Lord Visnu. Therefore,
when a Vaisnava is offended, the offender is punished by Visnu, the
Supreme Lord. No one can protect such a person, even Lord Brahma or
Lord Siva.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Fourth
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “Ambarisa Maharaja
Offended by Durvasa Muni.”


--- Page 152 ---
CHAPTER FIVE
Durvasa Muni’s Life Spared
In this chapter we find Maharaja Ambarisa offering prayers to the
Sudars$ana cakra and we find how the Sudar$ana cakra became merciful
to Durvasa Muni.

By the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu, Durvasa
Muni immediately went to Maharaja Ambarisa and fell at his lotus feet.
Maharaja Ambarisa, being naturally very humble and meek, felt shy and
ashamed because Durviasa Muni had fallen at his feet, and thus he began
to offer prayers to the Sudarsana cakra just to save Durvasa. What is this
Sudarsana cakra? The Sudar$ana cakra is the glance of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead by which He creates the entire material world. Sa
aiksata, sa asrjata. This is the Vedic version. The Sudarsana cakra,
which is the origin of creation and is most dear to the Lord, has thou-
sands of spokes. This Sudarsana cakra is the killer of the prowess of all
other weapons, the killer of darkness, and the manifester of the prowess
of devotional service; it is the means of establishing religious principles,
and it is the killer of all irreligious activities. Without his mercy, the uni-
verse cannot be maintained, and therefore the Sudarsana cakra is em-
ployed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When Maharaja
Ambarisa thus prayed that the ৩৮081858108 cakra be merciful, the
Sudarsana cakra, being appeased, refrained from killing Durvasa Muni,
who thus achieved the Sudar$ana cakra’s mercy. Durvasa Muni thus
learned to give up the nasty idea of considering a Vaisnava an ordinary
person (vaisnave jati-buddhi). Maharaja Ambarisa belonged to the
ksatriya group, and therefore Durvasa Muni considered him lower than
the brahmanas and wanted to exercise brahminical power against him.
By this incident, everyone should learn how to stop mischievous ideas of
neglecting Vaisnavas. After this incident, Maharaja Ambarisa gave
Durvasa Muni sumptuous food to eat, and then the King, who had been
standing in the same place for one year without eating anything, also
took prasada. Maharaja Ambarisa later divided his property among his
sons and went to the bank of the Manasa-sarovara to execute devotional
meditation.

O Sudar$ana wheel, you are religion, you are truth, you are en-

hands of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You are the original
vision of the Lord, and therefore you are known as Sudarsana.
Everything has been created by your activities, and therefore you
are all-pervading.
PURPORT
The word sudarsana means ‘‘auspicious vision.” From Vedic instruc-
tions we understand that this material world is created by the glance of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead (sa aiksata, sa asrjata). The
Supreme Personality of Godhead glanced over the mahat-tattva, or the
total material energy, and when it was agitated, everything came into ex-
istence. Western philosophers sometimes think that the original cause of
creation was a chunk that exploded. If one thinks of this chunk as the
total material energy, the mahat-tattva, one can understand that the
chunk was agitated by the glance of the Lord, and thus the Lord’s glance
is the original cause of material creation.

0 Sudarsana, you have a very auspicious hub, and therefore you
are the upholder of all religion. You are just like an inauspicious
comet for the irreligious demons. Indeed, you are the maintainer
of the three worlds, you are full of transcendental effulgence, you
are as quick as the mind, and you are able to work wonders. I can
simply utter the word ‘‘namah,” offering all obeisances unto you.

PURPORT

The disc of the Lord is called Sudaréana because he does not discrimi-
nate between high and low criminals or demons. Durvisa Muni was cer-
tainly a powerful bradhmana, but his acts against the pure devotee
Maharaja Ambarisa were no better than the activities of asuras. As stated
in the $astras, dharmari tu saksad bhagavat-pranitam: the word dharma
refers to the orders or laws given by the Supreme Personality of God-
head. Sarva-dharman parityajya mam eka Saranam vraja: real
dharma is surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Therefore real dharma means bhakti, or devotional service to the Lord.
The Sudaréana cakra is here addressed as dharma-setave, the protector
of dharma. Maharaja Ambarisa was a truly religious person, and conse-
quently for his protection the Sudar$ana cakra was ready to punish even
such a strict brahmana as Durvasa Muni because he had acted like a
demon. There are demons even in the form of brahmanas. Therefore the


--- Page 158 ---
Text 7] Durvasa Muni’s Life Spared 155
Sudars$ana cakra does not discriminate between brahmana demons and
Sitdra demons. Anyone against the Supreme Personality of Godhead and
His devotees is called a demon. In the $astras we find many brahmanas
and ksatriyas who acted as demons and have been described as demons.
According to the verdict of the $astras, one has to be understood accord-
ing to his symptoms. If one is born of a brahmana father but his
symptoms are demoniac, he is regarded as a demon. The Sudar$ana cakra
is always concerned with annihilating the demons. Therefore he is de-
scribed as adharma-silasura-dhiima-ketave. Those who are not devotees
are called adharma-sila. The Sudarsana cakra is just like an inauspicious
comet for all such demons.

of learned persons or great souls is manifested. Indeed, no one can
surpass your effulgence, for all things, manifested and un-
manifested, gross and subtle, superior and inferior, are but
various forms of you that are manifested by your effulgence.
PURPORT
Without illumination, nothing can be seen, especially in this material
world. The illumination in this world emanates from the effulgence of
৩৮০৭3188118, the original vision of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
The illuminating principles of the sun, the moon and fire emanate from
৩৮০৭3188113. Similarly, illumination by knowledge also comes from
Sudar$ana because with the illumination of Sudar$ana one can dis-
tinguish one thing from another, the superior from the inferior.
Generally people accept a powerful yogi like Durvasa Muni as wonder-
fully superior, but if such a person is chased by the Sudarsana cakra, we
can see his real identity and understand how inferior he is because of his
dealings with devotees.

gence, that you are the most exalted devotee of the Lord.
Therefore, simply by seeing you, touching your feet and talking
with you, I have been pleased and have become obliged to you.

PURPORT

It is said, vaisnavera kriya mudra vijieha na bujhaya: even a very in-
telligent man cannot understand the activities of a pure Vaisnava.
Therefore, because Durvasa Muni was a great mystic yogi, he first
mistook Maharaja Ambarisa for an ordinary human being and wanted to
punish him. Such is the mistaken observation of a Vaisnava. When
Durvasa Muni was persecuted by the Sudarsana cakra, however, his in-
telligence developed. Therefore the word atma-medhasa is used to indi-
cate that by his personal experience he would understand how great a
Vaisnava the King was. When Durvasa Muni was chased by the
Sudarsana cakra, he wanted to take shelter of Lord Brahma and Lord
Siva, and he was even able to go to the spiritual world, meet the Per-
sonality of Godhead and talk with Him face to face, yet he was unable to
be rescued from the attack of the Sudarsana cakra. Thus he could under-
stand the influence of a Vaisnava by personal experience. Durvasa Muni
was certainly a great yogi and a very learned brahmana, but despite his
being a real yogi he was unable to understand the influence of a
Vaisnava. Therefore it is said, vaisnavera kriya mudra vijieha na bu-
Jjhaya: even the most learned person cannot understand the value of a

Text 22] Durvasa Muni’s Life Spared 165
Vaisnava. There is always a possibility for so-called [नदा and yogis to be
mistaken when studying the character of a Vaisnava. A Vaisnava can be
understood by how much he is favored by the Supreme Personality of
Godhead in terms of his inconceivable activities.

TRANSLATION

Sri Sukadeva Gosvami continued: Thus being satisfied in all
respects, the great mystic yogi Durvasa took permission and left,
continuously glorifying the King. Through the skyways, he went
to Brahmaloka, which is devoid of agnostics and dry philosophical
speculators.

PURPORT

Although Durvisa Muni went back to Brahmaloka through the space-
ways, he did not need an airplane, for great mystic yogis can transport
themselves from any planet to any other without any machine. There is a
planet named Siddhaloka whose inhabitants can go to any other planet
because they naturally have all the perfection of yoga practice. Thus
Durvasa Muni, the great mystic yogi, could go through the skyways to
any planet, even to Brahmaloka. In Brahmaloka, everyone is self-
realized, and thus there is no need of philosophical speculation to come to
the conclusion of the Absolute Truth. Durvasa Muni’s purpose in going
to Brahmaloka was apparently to speak to the residents of Brahmaloka
about how powerful a devotee is and how a devotee can surpass every liv-
ing entity within this material world. The so-called jianis and yogis
cannot compare to a devotee.

After one year, when Durvasa Muni had returned, King
Ambarisa sumptuously fed him all varieties of pure food, and then
he himself also ate. When the King saw that the brahmana Durvasa


--- Page 171 ---

had been released from the great danger of being burned, he
could understand that by the grace of the Lord he himself was also
powerful, but he did not take any credit, for everything had been
done by the Lord.
PURPORT
A devotee like Maharaja Ambarisa is certainly always busy in many
activities. Of course, this material world is full of dangers that one has to
meet, but a devotee, because of his full dependence on the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead, is never disturbed. The vivid example is Maharaja
Ambarisa. He was the emperor of the entire world and had many duties
to perform, and in the course of these duties there were many distur-
bances created by persons like Durvasa Muni, but the King tolerated
everything, patiently depending fully on the mercy of the Lord. The
Lord, however, is situated in everyone's heart (sarvasya cahar hrdi
sannivistah), and He manages things as He desires. Thus although
Maharaja Ambarisa was faced with many disturbances, the Lord, being
merciful to him, managed things so nicely that in the end Durvasa Muni
and Maharaja Ambarisa became great friends and parted cordially on the
basis of bhakti-yoga. After all, Durvasa Muni was convinced of the
power of bhakti-yoga, although he himself was a great mystic yogi.
Therefore, as stated by Lord Krsna in Bhagavad-gita (6.47):
yoginam api sarvesari
mad-gatenantaratmanad
sraddhavan bhajate yo mam
sa me yuktatamo matah
“Of all yogis, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping
Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in
yoga and is the highest of all.”” Thus it is a fact that a devotee is the top-
most yogi, as proved in the dealings of Maharaja Ambarisa with Durvasa
Muni.

TRANSLATION
In this way, because of devotional service, Maharaja Ambarisa,
who was endowed with varieties of transcendental qualities, was
completely aware of Brahman, Paramatma and the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead, and thus he executed devotional service per-
fectly. Because of his devotion, he thought even the topmost
planet of this material world no better than the hellish planets.
PURPORT
An exalted and pure devotee like Maharaja Ambarisa is in full aware-
ness of Brahman, Paramatma and Bhagavan; in other words, a devotee
of Vasudeva, Krsna, is in full knowledge of the other features of the Ab-
solute Truth. The Absolute Truth is realized in three features —Brah-
man, Paramatma and Bhagavan (brahmeti paramatmeti bhagavan iti
sabdyate). A devotee of the Supreme Personality of Gedhead, Vasudeva,
knows everything (vasudevah sarvam iti) because Vasudeva, Krsna, in-
cludes both Paramitma and Brahman. One does not have to realize
Paramatma by the yoga system, for the devotee always thinking of
Vasudeva is the topmost yogi (yoginam api sarvesam). And as far as


--- Page 173 ---
170 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 5
Jjiiana is concerned, if one is a perfect devotee of Vasudeva, he is the
greatest mahatma (vasudevah sarvam iti sa mahatma sudurlabhah). A
mahatma is one who has full knowledge of the Absolute Truth. Thus
Maharaja Ambarisa, being a devotee of the Personality of Godhead, was
in full awareness of Paramatma, Brahman, maya, the material world,
the spiritual world, and how things are going on everywhere. Everything
was known to him. Yasmin vijiate sarvam evar vijiiatarin bhavati. Be-
cause the devotee knows Vasudeva, he knows everything within the cre-
ation of Vasudeva (vasudevah sarvam iti sa mahatma sudurlabhah).
Such a devotee does not give much value to the highest standard of
happiness within this material world.
narayana-parah sarve
na kutascana bibhyati
svargapavarga-narakesv
api tulyartha-darsinah
(Bhag. 6.17.28)
Because he is fixed in devotional service, a devotee does not regard any
position in the material world as important. Srila Prabodhananda
Sarasvati has therefore written (Caitanya-candramrta 5):
kaivalyam narakayate tridasa-par akasa-puspayate
durdantendriya-kala-sarpa-patali protkhata-damstrayate
viva purna-sukhayate vidhi-mahendradis ca kitayate
yat-karunya-kataksa-vaibhava-vatam tam gauram eva stumah
For one who becomes a pure devotee through devotional service to great
personalities like Caitanya Mahaprabhu, kaivalya, or merging into
Brahman, appears no better than hell. As far as the heavenly planets are
concerned, to a devotee they are like a phantasmagoria or will-o’-the-
wisp, and as far as yogic perfection is concerned, a devotee does not care
a fig for such perfection, since the purpose of yogic perfection is achieved
automatically by the devotee. This is all possible when one becomes a
devotee of the Lord through the medium of Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s
instructions.

longer desired to live with material things, retired from active
family life. He divided his property among his sons, who were
equally as qualified, and he himself took the order of vanaprastha
and went to the forest to concentrate his mind fully upon Lord
Vasudeva.
PURPORT
As a pure devotee, Maharaja Ambarisa was liberated in any condition
of life because, as enunciated by Srila Ripa Gosvami, a devotee is always
liberated.

In Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu, Srila Ripa Gosvami thus instructs that if
one’s only desire is service to the Lord, he is liberated in any condition of
life. Maharaja Ambarisa was undoubtedly liberated in any condition, but
as an ideal king he accepted the vanaprastha order of retirement from
family life. It is essential for one to renounce family responsibilities and
fully concentrate on the lotus feet of Vasudeva. Therefore Maharaja
Ambarisa divided the kingdom among his sons and retired from family
life.

satisfied even when he is a millionaire or a multimillionaire, but wants to
earn more and more money by any means. The same mentality is present
in a devotee. The devotee is never satisfied, thinking, “This is the limit
of my devotional service.” The more he engages in the service of the
Lord, the more service he wants to give. This is the position of a devotee.
Maharaja Ambarisa, in his family life, was certainly a pure devotee, com-
plete in every respect, because his mind and all his senses were engaged
in devotional service (sa vai manah krsna-padaravindayor vacarisi
vaikuntha-gunanuvarnane). Maharaja Ambarisa was self-satisfied
because all of his senses were engaged in devotional service (sarvopadhi-
vinirmuktarh tat-paratvena nirmalam/ hrsikena hrsikesa-sevanari bhak-
tir ucyate). Nonetheless, although Maharaja Ambarisa had engaged all
his senses in devotional service, he left his home and went to the forest to
concentrate his mind fully at the lotus feet of Krsna, exactly as a mercan-
tile man, even though complete in wealth, tries to earn more and more.
This mentality of getting more and more engaged in devotional service
puts one in the most exalted position. Whereas on the karma platform
the mercantile man who wants more and more money becomes in-
creasingly bound and entangled, the devotee becomes increasingly
liberated.

CHAPTER SIX
The Downfall of Saubhari Muni
After describing the descendants of ‘Maharaja Ambarisa, Sukadeva
Gosvami described all the kings from Sasada to Mandhata, and in this
connection he also described how the great sage Saubhari married the
daughters of Mandhata.

Maharaja Ambarisa had three sons, named Viripa, Ketuman and
Sambhu. The son of Viripa was Prsadasva, and his son was Rathitara.
Rathitara had no sons, but when he requested the favor of the great sage
Angira, the sage begot several sons in the womb of Rathitara’s wife.
When the sons were born, they became the dynasty of Angira Rsi and of
Rathitara.

The son of Manu was lksvaku, who had one hundred sons, of whom
Vikuksi, Nimi and Dandaka were the eldest. The sons of Maharaja
Iksvaku became kings of different parts of the world. Because of violat-
ing sacrificial rules and regulations, one of these sons, Vikuksi, was
banished from the kingdom. By the mercy of Vasistha and the power of
mystic yoga, Maharaja Iksvaku attained liberation after giving up his
material body. When Maharaja lksvaku expired, his son Vikuksi
returned and took charge of the kingdom. He performed various types of
sacrifices, and thus he pleased the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This
Vikuksi later became celebrated as Sasada.

Vikuksi’s son fought with the demons for the sake of the demigods,
and because of his valuable service he became famous as Puraiijaya,
Indravaha and Kakutstha. The son of Puranjaya was Anena, the son of
Anena was Prthu, and the son of Prthu was Visvagandhi. The son of
Viévagandhi was Candra, the son of Candra was Yuvanasva, and his son
was Sravasta, who constructed Sravasti Puri. The son of Sravasta was
Brhadasva. Brhadasva’s son Kuvalayasva killed a demon named
Dhundhu, and thus he became celebrated as Dhundhumara, “‘the killer
of Dhundhu.” The sons of the killer of Dhundhu were Drdhasva,
Kapilasva and Bhadrasva. He also had thousands of other sons, but they
burned to ashes in the fire emanating from Dhundhu. The son of

175


--- Page 179 ---
176 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 6
Drdhasva was Haryasva, the son of Haryasva was Nikumbha, the son of
Nikumbha was Bahulasva, and the son of Bahulasva was Kréasva. The
son of Kréasva was Senajit, and his son was Yuvanasva.

Yuvanisva married one hundred wives, but he had no sons, and
therefore he entered the forest. In the forest, the sages performed a
sacrifice known as Indra-yajfia on his behalf. Once, however, the King
became so thirsty in the forest that he drank the water kept for perform-
ing yajiia. Consequently, after some time, a son came forth from the
right side of his abdomen. The son, who was very beautiful, was crying
to drink breast milk, and Indra gave the child his index finger to suck.
Thus the son became known as Mandhata. In due course of time,
Yuvanasva achieved perfection by performing austerities.

Thereafter, Mandhata became the emperor and ruled the earth, which
consists of seven islands. Thieves and rogues were very much afraid of
this powerful king, and therefore the king was known as Trasaddasyu,
meaning “0116 who is very fearful to rogues and thieves.” Mandhata
begot sons in the womb of his wife, Bindumati. These sons were
Purukutsa, Ambarisa and Mucukunda. These three sons had fifty sisters,
all of whom became wives of the great sage known as Saubhari.

In this connection, Sukadeva Gosvami described the history of
Saubhari Muni, who, because of sensual agitation caused by fish, fell
from his yoga and wanted to marry all the daughters of Mandhata for
sexual pleasure. Later, Saubhari Muni became very regretful. Thus he
accepted the order of vanaprastha, performed very severe austerities,
and thus attained perfection. In this regard, Sukadeva Gosvami described
how Saubhari Muni’s wives also became perfect.

TRANSLATION
Rathitara had no sons, and therefore he requested the great sage
Angira to beget sons for him. Because of this request, Angira
begot sons in the womb of Rathitara’s wife. All these sons were
born with brahminical prowess.

178 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 6
PURPORT
In the Vedic age a man was sometimes called upon to beget sons in the
womb of a lesser man’s wife for the sake of better progeny. In such an
instance, the woman is compared to an agricultural field. A person
possessing an agricultural field may employ another person to produce
food grains from it, but because the grains are produced from the land,
they are considered the property of the owner of the land. Similarly, a
woman was sometimes allowed to be impregnated by someone other than
her husband, but the sons born of her would then become her husband’s
sons. Such sons were called ksetra-jata. Because Rathitara had no sons,
he took advantage of this method.

brahmana (being a mixture of brahmana and ksatriya).
TRANSLATION
Having been born from the womb of Rathitara’s wife, all these
sons were known as the dynasty of Rathitara, but because they
were born from the semen of Angira, they were also known as the
dynasty of Angira. Among all the progeny of Rathitara, these sons
were the most prominent because, owing to their birth, they were
considered brahmanas.

Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura gives the meaning of dvi-jatayah
as “mixed caste,” indicating a mixture of brahmana and ksatriya.

The son of Manu was lksvaku. When Manu was sneezing,
Iksvaku was born from Manu’s nostrils. King Iksvaku had one
hundred sons, of whom Vikuksi, Nimi and Dandaka were the most
prominent.
PURPORT
According to Sridhara Svami, although the Bhagavatam (9.1.11-12)
has previously included Iksvaku among the ten sons begotten by Manu in
his wife Sraddha, this was a generalization. It is here specifically ex-
plained that Iksvaku was born simply from the sneezing of Manu.

middle. The other sons became kings in various other places.

TRANSLATION
During the months of January, February and March, oblations
offered to the forefathers are called astaka-éraddha. The éraddha
ceremony is held during the dark fortnight of the month. When
Maharaja Iksvaiku was performing his oblations in this ceremony,
he ordered his son Vikuksi to go immediately to the forest to bring
some pure flesh.

(that the flesh was meant for offering in the sraddha).
TRANSLATION
Thereafter, Iksvaku’s son Vikuksi went to the forest and killed
many animals suitable for being offered as oblations. But when
fatigued and hungry he became forgetful and ate a rabbit he had
killed.
PURPORT
It is evident that ksatriyas killed animals in the forest because the
flesh of the animals was suitable to be offered at a particular type of
yajita. Offering oblations to the forefathers in the ceremony known as
sraddha is also a kind of yajiia. In this yajiia, flesh obtained from the


--- Page 185 ---
182 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 6
forest by hunting could be offered. However, in the present age, Kali-
yuga, this kind of offering is forbidden. Quoting from the Brahma-
vaivarta Purana, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu said:
asvamedham gavalambham
sannyasam pala-paitrkam
devarena sutotpattim
kalau paiica vivarjayet
“In this age of Kali, five acts are forbidden: the offering of a horse in
sacrifice, the offering of a cow in sacrifice, the acceptance of the order of
sannydasa, the offering of oblations of flesh to the forefathers, and a
man’s begetting children in his brother’s wife.” The word pala-paitrkam
refers to an offering of flesh in oblations to forefathers. Formerly, such
an offering was allowed, but in this age it is forbidden. In this age, Kali-
yuga, everyone is expert in hunting animals, but most of the people are
Siidras, not ksatriyas. According to Vedic injunctions, however, only
ksatriyas are allowed to hunt, whereas Siidras are allowed to eat flesh
after offering goats or other insignificant animals before the deity of
goddess Kili or similar demigods. On the whole, meat-eating is not
completely forbidden; a particular class of men is allowed to eat meat ac-
cording to various circumstances and injunctions. As far as eating beef is
concerned, however, it is strictly prohibited to everyone. Thus in
Bhagavad-gita Krsna personally speaks of go-raksyam, cow protection.
Meat-eaters, according to their different positions and the directions of
the $astra, are allowed to eat flesh, but never the flesh of cows. Cows
must be given all protection.

master; coditah—being requested; proksandya—for purifying; aha—

TRANSLATION
Vikuksi offered the remnants of the flesh to King Iksvaku, who
gave it to Vasistha for purification. But Vasistha could immediately
understand that part of the flesh had already been taken by
Vikuksi, and therefore he said that it was unfit to be used in the
sraddha ceremony.
PURPORT
That which is meant to be offered in yajiia cannot be tasted by anyone
before being offered to the Deity. In our temples, this regulation is in
effect. One cannot eat food from the kitchen unless it is offered to the
Deity. If something is taken before being offered to the Deity, the entire
preparation is polluted and can no longer be offered. Those engaged in
Deity worship must know this very well so that they may be saved from
committing offenses in Deity worship.

empowered by Lord Visnu, who is the Supersoul and the Supreme
Person, Puraiijaya sat on the great bull and is therefore known as
Indravaha. Surrounded by the demigods, he attacked the residence
of the demons in the west.

bahulasvah—of the name Bahulasva; nikumbhasya—of Nikumbha;

TRANSLATION
The son of Nikumbha was Bahulaéva, the son of Bahulaéva was
Krsasva, the son of KréaSva was Senajit, and the son of Senajit was
Yuvanasva. Yuvanaéva had no sons, and thus he retired from
family life and went to the forest.

TRANSLATION
Although Yuvanasva went into the forest with his one hundred
wives, all of them were very morose. The sages in the forest,
however, being very kind to the King, began very carefully and at-
tentively performing an Indra-yajiia so that the King might have a
son.
PURPORT
One may enter the vanaprastha order of life with his wife, but the
vanaprastha order means complete retirement from household life.

194 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 6
Although King Yuvanasva retired from family life, he and his wives
were always morose because he had no son.

TRANSLATION
Being thirsty one night, the King entered the arena of sacrifice,
and when he saw all the brahmanas lying down, he personally
drank the sanctified water meant to be drunk by his wife.
PURPORT
Yajiias performed by brahmanas according to Vedic ritualistic
ceremonies are so potent that the sanctifying of water by Vedic mantras
can bring about the desired result. In this instance, the brahmanas
sanctified the water so that the King’s wife might drink it in the yajiia,
but by providence the King himself went there at night and, being
thirsty, drank the water.

claimed ‘Alas! The power of providence is real power. No one can

The baby cried so much for breast milk that all the brahmanas
were very unhappy. “Who will take care of this baby?” they said.
Then Indra, who was worshiped in that yajiia, came and solaced the
baby. “Do not cry,” Indra said. Then Indra put his index finger in
the baby’s mouth and said, ‘You may drink me.”

mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the son of

Yuvanasva was so powerful that when he became emperor he ruled

the entire world, consisting of seven islands, without any second

ruler.

Saubhari Rsi was engaged in austerity, deep in the water of the

Thus he perceived the pleasure of sex life, and induced by this
desire he went to King Mandhata and begged for one of the King’s
daughters. In response to this request, the King said, “O
brahmana, any of my daughters may accept any husband according
to her personal selection.”
PURPORT
This is the beginning of the story of Saubhari Rsi. According to
Viévanatha Cakravarti Thakura, Mandhata was the king of Mathura, and
Saubhari Rsi was engaged in austerity while submerged deep within the
River Yamuna. When the rsi felt sexual desire, he emerged from the
water and went to King Mandhata to ask that one of the King’s daughters
become his wife.

Saubhari Muni thought: I am now feeble because of old age. My

Since the King has thus rejected me, I shall reform my body in
such a way as to be desirable even to celestial women, what to speak
of the daughters of worldly kings.

TRANSLATION
Because Saubhari Muni was expert in chanting mantras per-
fectly, his severe austerities resulted in an opulent home, with


--- Page 209 ---
206 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 6
garments, ornaments, properly dressed and decorated maidser-
vants and manservants, and varieties of parks with clear-water
lakes and gardens. In the gardens, fragrant with varieties of
flowers, birds chirped and bees hummed, surrounded by profes-
sional singers. Saubhari Muni’s home was amply provided with
valuable beds, seats, ornaments, and arrangements for bathing,
and there were varieties of sandalwood creams, flower garlands,
and palatable dishes. Thus surrounded by opulent paraphernalia,
the muni engaged in family affairs with his numerous wives.
PURPORT

Saubhari Rsi was a great yogi. Yogic perfection makes available eight
material opulences —anima, laghima, mahima, prapti, prakamya,
iSitva, vaSitva and kamavasayitd. Saubhari Muni exhibited superex-
cellence in material enjoyment by dint of his yogic perfection. The word
bahv-rca means ‘‘expert in chanting mantras. ’’ As material opulence can
be achieved by ordinary material means, it can also be achieved by subtle
means through mantras. By chanting mantras, Saubhari Muni arranged
for material opulence, but this was not perfection in life. As will be seen,
Saubhari Muni became very dissatisfied with material opulence and thus
left everything and reentered the forest in the vdnaprastha order and
achieved final success. Those who are not atma-tattva-vit, who do not
know the spiritual value of life, can be satisfied with external material
opulences, but those who are atma-tattva-vit are not inspired by material
opulence. This is the instruction we can derive from the life and
activities of Saubhari Muni.

Mandhata, the King of the entire world, consisting of seven
islands, was struck with wonder when he saw the household opu-
lence of Saubhari Muni. Thus he gave up his false prestige in his
position as emperor of the world.

PURPORT

Everyone is proud of his own position, but here was an astounding ex-
perience, in which the emperor of the entire world felt himself defeated
in all details of material happiness by the opulence of Saubhari Muni.

TRANSLATION
In this way, Saubhari Muni enjoyed sense gratification in the
material world, but he was not at all satisfied, just as a fire never
ceases blazing if constantly supplied with drops of fat.
PURPORT
Material desire is just like a blazing fire. If a fire is continually sup-
plied with drops of fat, the fire will increase more and more and never be
extinguished. Therefore the policy of trying to satisfy material desires by
catering to one’s material demands will never be successful. In modern
civilization, everyone is engaged in economic development, which is
another way of constantly dropping fat into the material fire. The
Western countries have reached the summit of material civilization, but
people are still dissatisfied. Real satisfaction is Krsna consciousness. This
is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (5.29), where Krsna says:
bhoktaram yajia-tapasarn
sarva-loka-mahesvaram
suhrdam sarva-bhiitanam
JRatva mam santim rcchati
“The sages, knowing Me as the ultimate purpose of all sacrifices and
austerities, the Supreme Lord of all planets and demigods and the
benefactor and well-wisher of all living entities, attain peace from the
pangs of material miseries.” One must therefore take to Krsna conscious-
ness and advance in Krsna consciousness by properly following the
regulative principles. Then one can attain an eternal, blissful life in
peace and knowledge.

TRANSLATION
Thereafter, one day while Saubhari Muni, who was expert in
chanting mantras, was sitting in a secluded place, he thought to
himself about the cause of his falldlown, which was simply that he
had associated himself with the sexual affairs of the fish.
PURPORT
Vi$vanatha Cakravarti Thakura remarks that Saubhari Muni had
fallen from his austerity because of a vaisnava-aparadha. The history is
that when Garuda wanted to eat fish, Saubhari Muni unnecessarily gave
the fish shelter under his care. Because Garuda’s plans for eating were
disappointed, Saubhari Muni certainly committed a great offense to a
Vaisnava. Because of this vaisnava-aparadha, an offense at the lotus feet
of a Vaisnava, Saubhari Muni fell from his exalted position of mystic
tapasya. One should not, therefore, impede the activities of a Vaisnava.
This is the lesson we must learn from this incident concerning Saubhari
Muni.

TRANSLATION

Alas! While practicing austerity, even within the depths of the
water, and while observing all the rules and regulations practiced
by saintly persons, I lost the results of my long austerities simply
by association with the sexual affairs of fish. Everyone should
observe this falldown and learn from it.

fixed at the lotus feet of the unlimited Supreme Personality of Godhead;

yufijita—one can engage himself; tat-vratisu—with persons of the same

category (desiring liberation from material bondage); sadhusu—such

saintly persons; cet—if; prasarigah—one wants association.
TRANSLATION

A person desiring liberation from material bondage must give
up the association of persons interested in sex life and should not
employ his senses externally [in seeing, hearing, talking, walking
and so on]. One should always stay in a secluded place, completely
fixing his mind at the lotus feet of the unlimited Personality of
Godhead, and if one wants any association at all, he should
associate with persons similarly engaged.

PURPORT

Saubhari Muni, giving conclusions derived from his practical ex-
perience, instructs us that persons interested in crossing to the other side
of the material ocean must give up the association of persons interested
in sex life and accumulating money. This is also advised by Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu:

niskiicanasya bhagavad-bhajanonmukasya
param param jigamisor bhava-sagarasya
sandarsanam visayinam atha yositam ca
ha hanta hanta visa-bhaksanato ‘py asadhu
(Caitanya-candrodaya-nataka 8.27)
“Alas, for a person seriously desiring to cross the material ocean and
engage in the transcendental loving service of the Lord without material
motives, seeing a materialist engaged in sense gratification and seeing a
woman who is similarly interested is more abominable than drinking
poison willingly.”

One who desires complete freedom from material bondage can engage
himself in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. He must not
associate with visayi—materialistic persons or those interested in sex
life. Every materialist is interested in sex. Thus in plain language it is


--- Page 215 ---
212 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 6
advised that an exalted saintly person avoid the association of those who
are materially inclined. Srila Narottama dasa Thakura also recommends
that one engage in the service of the acaryas, and if one wants to live in
association, he must live in the association of devotees (tandera carana
sevi bhakta-sane vasa). The Krsna consciousness movement is creating
many centers just to create devotees so that by associating with the mem-
bers of such a center people will automatically become uninterested in
material affairs. Although this is an ambitious proposal, this association
is proving effective by the mercy of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. By gradu-
ally associating with the members of the Krsna consciousness movement,
simply by taking prasada and taking part in chanting of the Hare Krsna
mantra, ordinary persons are being considerably elevated. Saubhari
Muni regrets that he had bad association even in the deepest part of the
water. Because of the bad association of the sexually engaged fish, he fell
down. A secluded place is also not secure unless there is good association.

TRANSLATION
In the beginning I was alone and engaged in performing the
austerities of mystic yoga, but later, because of the association of
fish engaged in sex, I desired to marry. Then I became the husband
of fifty wives, and in each of them I begot one hundred sons, and
thus my family increased to five thousand members. By the in-
fluence of the modes of material nature, I became fallen and
thought that I would be happy in material life. Thus there is no
end to my material desires for enjoyment, in this life and the next.

TRANSLATION
In this way he passed his life in household affairs for some time,
but then he became detached from material enjoyment. To
renounce material association, he accepted the vanaprastha order
and went to the forest. His devoted wives followed him, for they
had no shelter other than their husband.

tatra—in the forest; taptvd—executing austerity; tapah—the regula-
tive principles of austerity; tikspam—very severely; atma-darsanam—
which helps self-realization; atmavan—conversant with the self; saha—
with; eva —certainly; agnibhih—fires; atmanam—the personal self;
yuyoja—he engaged; parama-dtmani—dealing with the Supreme Soul.

TRANSLATION

When Saubhari Muni, who was quite conversant with the self,
went to the forest, he performed severe penances. In this way, in
the fire at the time of death, he ultimately engaged himself in the
service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

PURPORT

At the time of death, fire burns the gross body, and if there is no more
desire for material enjoyment the subtle body is also ended, and in this
way a pure soul remains. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (tyaktva
dehar punar janma naiti). If one is free from the bondage of both the
gross and subtle material bodies and remains a pure soul, he returns
home, back to Godhead, to be engaged in the service of the Lord.
Tyaktva deharih punar janma naiti mam eti: he goes back home, back to
Godhead. Thus it appears that Saubhari Muni attained that perfect stage.

tah—all the wives of Saubhari; sva-patyuh—with their own husband;
maharaja—O King Pariksit; niriksya—observing; adhyatmikim —spiri-
tual; gatim—progress; anviyuh—followed; tat-prabhavena —by the in-
fluence of their husband (although they were unfit, by the influence of
their husband they also could go to the spiritual world); agnim—the
fire; Santam —completely merged; iva —like; arcisah—the flames.

TRANSLATION

O Maharaja Pariksit, by observing their husband progressing in
spiritual existence, Saubhari Muni’s wives were also able to enter
the spiritual world by his spiritual power, just as the flames of a
fire cease when the fire is extinguished.

PURPORT

As stated in Bhagavad-gita (9.32), striyo vaisyas tatha Sudras te pi
yanti parari gatim. Women are not considered very powerful in follow-
ing spiritual principles, but if a woman is fortunate enough to get a suit-
able husband who is spiritually advanced and if she always engages in his
service, she also gets the same benefit as her husband. Here it is clearly
said that the wives of Saubhari Muni also entered the spiritual world by
the influence of their husband. They were unfit, but because they were
faithful followers of their husband, they also entered the spiritual world
with him. Thus a woman should be a faithful servant of her husband,
and if the husband is spiritually advanced, the woman will automatically
get the opportunity to enter the spiritual world.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Sixth
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled (711८ Downfall of Saubhari
Muni.”

CHAPTER SEVEN
The Descendants of King Mandhata
In this chapter the descendants of King Mandhata are described, and in
this connection the histories of Purukutsa and HariScandra are also
given.

The most prominent son of 13811011808 was Ambarisa, his son was
Yauvanasva, and Yauvanasva’s son was Harita. These three personalities
were the best in the dynasty of Mandhata. Purukutsa, another son of
Mandhata, married the sister of the snakes (sarpa-gana) named
Narmada. The son of Purukutsa was Trasaddasyu, whose son was
Anaranya. Anaranya’s son was Haryasva, Haryasva’s son was Praruna,
Praruna’s son was Tribandhana, and Tribandhana’s son was Satyavrata,
also known as Trisanku. When Trisanku kidnapped the daughter of a
brahmana, his father cursed him for this sinful act, and Trianku be-
came a canddla, worse than a Sidra. Later, by the influence of
Viévamitra, he was brought to the heavenly planets, but by the influence
of the demigods he fell back downward. He was stopped in his fall,
liowever, by the influence of ViSvamitra. The son of TriSanku was
HariScandra. Hariécandra once performed a Rajasaya-yajiia, but
Viévamitra cunningly took all of Haridcandra’s possessions as a daksina
contribution and chastised Hariscandra in various ways. Because of this,
a quarrel arose between ViSvamitra and Vasistha. Hariécandra had no
sons, but on the advice of Narada he worshiped Varuna and in this way
got a son named Rohita. Hari$candra promised that Rohita would be used
to perform a Varuna-yajia. Varuna reminded HariScandra repeatedly
about this yajiia, but the King, because of affection for his son, gave
various arguments to avoid sacrificing him. Thus time passed, and
gradually the son grew up. To safeguard his life, the boy then took bow
and arrows in hand and went to the forest. Meanwhile, at home,
HariScandra suffered from dropsy because of an attack from Varuna.
When Rohita received the news that his father was suffering, he wanted
to return to the capital, but King Indra prevented him from doing so.
Following the instructions of Indra, Rohita lived in the forest for six

217


--- Page 220 ---
218 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 7
years and then returned home. Rohita purchased Sunahéepha, the second
son of Ajigarta, and gave him to his father, HariScandra, as the sacrificial
animal. In this way, the sacrifice was performed, Varuna and the other
demigods were pacified, and Hariécandra was freed from disease. In this
sacrifice, Vi§vamitra was the hota priest, Jamadagni was the adhvaryu,
Vasistha was the brahma, and Ayasya was the udgata. King Indra, being
very satisfied by the sacrifice, gave Hariécandra a golden chariot, and
Visvamitra gave him transcendental knowledge. Thus Sukadeva
Gosvami describes how HariScandra achieved perfection.

Viévamitra, he went to the higher planetary system, the heavenly
planets, in his material body, but because of the prowess of the
demigods he fell back downward. Nonetheless, by the power of
Viévamitra, he did not fall all the way down; even today he can still

TRANSLATION
The son of Trisannku was Hariscandra. Because of Hariscandra
there was a quarrel between Vi§vamitra and Vasistha, who for
many years fought one another, having been transformed into
birds.
PURPORT
Vi$vamitra and Vasistha were always inimical. Formerly, Visvamitra
was a ksatriya, and by undergoing severe austerities he wanted to be-
come a brahmana, but Vasistha would not agree to accept him. In this
way there was always disagreement between the two. Later, however,
Vasistha accepted him because of Visvamitra’s quality of forgiveness.
Once HariScandra performed a yagjiia for which Vi§vamitra was the
priest, but Vi§vamitra, being angry at HariScandra, took away all his


--- Page 225 ---
Text 8] The Descendants of King Mandhata 223
possessions, claiming them as a contribution of daksind. Vasistha,
however, did not like this, and therefore a fight arose between Vasistha
and Visvamitra. The fighting became so severe that each of them cursed
the other. One of them said, “May you become a bird,” and the other
said, “May you become a duck.” Thus both of them became birds and
continued fighting for many years because of HariScandra. We can see
that such a great mystic yogi as Saubhari became a victim of sense grati-
fication, and such great sages as Vasistha and Visvamitra became birds.
This is the material world. Abrahma-bhuvanal lokah punar avartino
‘rjuna. Within this material world, or within this universe, however ele-
vated one may be in material qualities, one must suffer the conditions of
birth, death, old age and disease (janma-mrtyu-jara-vyadhi). Therefore
Krsna says that this material world is simply miserable (duhkhalayam
asasvatam). The Bhagavatam says, [00007 [9007 yad vipadam: at
every step here there is danger. Therefore, because the Krsna conscious-
ness movement provides the opportunity for the human being to get out
of this material world simply by chanting the Hare Krsna mantra, this
movement is the greatest benediction in human society.

Thereafter, in the sixth year, after wandering in the forest,

Ajigarta his second son, named Sunahsepha. Then he offered
Sunahsepha to his father, HariScandra, to be used as the sacrificial
animal and offered HariScandra his respectful obeisances.

PURPORT

It appears that in those days a man could be purchased for any pur-
pose. Hari$candra was in need of a person to sacrifice as the animal in a
yajiia and thus fulfill his promise to Varuna, and a man was purchased
from another man for this purpose. Millions of years ago, animal
sacrifice and slave trade both existed. Indeed, they have existed since
time immemorial.

Varuna was cured.

TRANSLATION

Maharaja Hari$candra first purified his mind, which was full of
material enjoyment, by amalgamating it with the earth. Then he
amalgamated the earth with water, the water with fire, the fire with
the air, and the air with the sky. Thereafter, he amalgamated the
sky with the total material energy, and the total material energy
with spiritual knowledge. This spiritual knowledge is realization
of one’s self as part of the Supreme Lord. When the self-realized
spiritual soul is engaged in service to the Lord, he is eternally im-
perceptible and inconceivable. Thus established in spiritual
knowledge, he is completely freed from material bondage.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Seventh
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled ‘The Descendants of King
Mandhata.”

CHAPTER EIGHT
The Sons of Sagara
Meet Lord Kapiladeva
In this Eighth Chapter the descendants of Rohita are described. In the
dynasty of Rohita there was a king named Sagara, whose history is de-
scribed in relation to Kapiladeva and the destruction of the sons of
Sagara.

The son of Rohita was known as Harita, and the son of Harita was
Campa, who constructed a township known as Campapuri. The son of
Campa was Sudeva, the son of Sudeva was Vijaya, the son of Vijaya was
Bharuka, and the son of Bharuka was Vrka. Bahuka, the son of Vrka,
was greatly disturbed by his enemies, and therefore he left home with
his wife and went to the forest. When he died there, his wife wanted to
accept the principles of sati, dying with her husband, but when she was
about to die a sage named Aurva found that she was pregnant and for-
bade her to do so. The co-wives of this wife of Bahuka gave her poison
with her food, but still her son was born with the poison. The son was
therefore named Sagara (sa means “with,” and gara means “‘poison”).
Following the instructions of the great sage Aurva, King Sagara
reformed many clans, including the Yavanas, Sakas, Haihayas and
Barbaras. The king did not kill them, but reformed them. Then, again
following the instructions of Aurva, King Sagara performed asvamedha
sacrifices, but the horse needed for such a sacrifice was stolen by Indra,
the King of heaven. King Sagara had two wives, named Sumati and
Kesini. While searching for the horse, the sons of Sumati extensively dug
up the surface of the earth and in this way dug a trench, which later be-
came known as the Sagara Ocean. In the course of this search, they came
upon the great personality Kapiladeva and thought Him to have stolen
the horse. With this offensive understanding, they attacked Him and
were all burned to ashes. Keéini, the second wife of King Sagara, had a
son named Asamaifijasa, whose son Amsuman later searched for the horse
and delivered his uncles. Upon approaching Kapiladeva, Am$uman saw

237


--- Page 239 ---
238 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 8
both the horse meant for sacrifice and a pile of ashes. Am$uman offered
prayers to Kapiladeva, who was very pleased by his prayers and who
returned the horse. After getting back the horse, however, Am$uman
still stood before Kapiladeva, and Kapiladeva could understand that
Améuman was praying for the deliverance of his forefathers. Thus
Kapiladeva offered the instruction that they could be delivered by water
from the Ganges. Ams$uman then offered respectful obeisances to
Kapiladeva, circumambulated Him, and left that place with the horse for
sacrifice. When King Sagara finished his yajiia, he handed over the
kingdom to Ams$uman and, following the advice of Aurva, attained
salvation.

following the order of their father, searched for the lost horse.
While doing so, they dug into the earth very extensively.

Thereafter, in the northeastern direction, they saw the horse
near the arama of Kapila Muni. “Here is the man who has stolen
the horse,” they said. ‘He is staying there with closed eyes. Cer-
tainly he is very sinful. Kill him! Kill him!”* Shouting like this, the
sons of Sagara, sixty thousand all together, raised their weapons.
‘When they approached the sage, the sage opened His eyes.

By the influence of Indra, the King of heaven, the sons of Sagara
had lost their intelligence and disrespected a great personality.
Consequently, fire emanated from their own bodies, and they were
immediately burned to ashes.

Text 12] The Sons of Sagara Meet Lord Kapiladeva 245
PURPORT

The material body is a combination of earth, water, fire, air and ether.
There is already fire within the body, and our practical experience is that
the heat of this fire sometimes increases and sometimes decreases. The
fire within the bodies of the sons of Sagara Maharaja became so much
hotter that all of them burned to ashes. The fire’s increased heat was due
to their misbehavior toward a great personality. Such misbehavior is
called mahad-vyatikrama. They were killed by the fire of their own
bodies because of insulting a great personality.

TRANSLATION

It is sometimes argued that the sons of King Sagara were burned
to ashes by the fire emanating from the eyes of Kapila Muni. This
statement, however, is not approved by great learned persons, for
Kapila Muni’s body is completely in the mode of goodness and


--- Page 247 ---
246 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 8
therefore cannot manifest the mode of ignorance in the form of
anger, just as the pure sky cannot be polluted by the dust of the
earth.

TRANSLATION
Kapila Muni enunciated in this material world the Sankhya phi-
losophy, which is a strong boat with which to cross over the ocean
of nescience. Indeed, a person eager to cross the ocean of the ma-
terial world may take shelter of this philosophy. In such a greatly
learned person, situated on the elevated platform of transcen-
dence, how can there be any distinction between enemy and
friend?
PURPORT
One who is promoted to the transcendental position (brahma-bhita) is
always jubilant (prasannatma). He is unaffected by the false distinctions


--- Page 248 ---
Text 16] The Sons of Sagara Meet Lord Kapiladeva 247
between good and bad in the material world. Therefore, such an exalted
person is samah sarvesu bhiitesu; that is to say, he is equal toward every-
one, not distinguishing between friend and enemy. Because he is on the
absolute platform, free from material contamination, he is called
paratma-bhita or brahma-bhita. Kapila Muni, therefore, was not at all
angry at the sons of Sagara Maharaja; rather, they were burnt to ashes by
the heat of their own bodies.

TRANSLATION

Among the sons of Sagara Maharaja was one named Asamaiijasa,
who was born from the King’s second wife, Kesini. The son of
Asamaiijasa was known as ArmmSuman, and he was always engaged in
working for the good of Sagara Maharaja, his grandfather.

TRANSLATION
Formerly, in his previous birth, Asamaiijasa had been a great
mystic yogi, but by bad association he had fallen from his exalted
position. Now, in this life, he was born in a royal family and was a
jati-smara; that is, he had the special advantage of being able to
remember his past birth. Nonetheless, he wanted to display him-
self as a miscreant, and therefore he would do things that were
abominable in the eyes of the public and unfavorable to his rela-
tives. He would disturb the boys sporting in the River Saraya by
throwing them into the depths of the water.

TRANSLATION
Because Asamaijasa engaged in such abominable activities, his
father gave up affection for him and had him exiled. Then
Asamaiijasa exhibited his mystic power by reviving the boys and
showing them to the King and their parents. After this,
Asamaiijasa left Ayodhya.
PURPORT
Asamaiijasa was a jati-smara; because of his mystic power, he did not
forget his previous consciousness. Thus he could give life to the dead. By
exhibiting wonderful activities in relation to the dead children, he cer-
tainly attracted the attention of the King and the people in general. Then
he left that place immediately.

Thereafter, AhSuman, the grandson of Maharaja Sagara, was or-

traversed by his uncles, Amh$uman gradually reached the stack of
ashes and found the horse nearby.

either by meditation or by mental speculation. So what to speak of

as demigods, animals, human beings, birds and beasts? We are
completely in ignorance. Therefore, how can we know You, who
are the Transcendence?

०0 scion of Bharata [Arjuna], O conqueror of the foe, all living entities
are born into delusion, overcome by the dualities of desire and hate.”
(Bg. 7.27) All living beings in the material world are influenced by the
three modes of material nature. Even Lord Brahma is in the mode of
goodness. Similarly, the demigods are generally in the mode of passion,
and living entities lower than the demigods, such as human beings and
animals, are in the mode of ignorance, or in mixed goodness, passion and
ignorance. Therefore Am$umin wanted to explain that because his
uncles, who had burnt to ashes, were under the modes of material
nature, they could not understand Lord Kapiladeva. “Because You are
beyond even the direct and indirect intelligence of Lord Brahma,” he
prayed, “unless we are enlightened by Your Lordship it will not be
possible for us to understand You.”

“My Lord, if one is favored by even a slight trace of the mercy of Your
lotus feet, he can understand the greatness of Your personality. But those
who speculate to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead are
unable to know You, even though they continue to study the Vedas for
many years.” (Bhag. 10.14.29) The Lord, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, can be understood by one who is favored by the Lord; the Lord
cannot be understood by others.

My Lord, You are fully situated in everyone’s heart, but the liv-

ing entities, covered by the material body, cannot see You, for they
are influenced by the external energy, conducted by the three
modes of material nature. Their intelligence being covered by

sattva-guna, rajo-guna and tamo-guna, they can see only the ac-
tions and reactions of these three modes of material nature. Be-
cause of the actions and reactions of the mode of ignorance,
whether the living entities are awake or sleeping, they can see only
the workings of material nature; they cannot see Your Lordship.
PURPORT
Unless one is situated in the transcendental loving service of the Lord,
one is unable to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The
Lord is situated in everyone’s heart. However, because the conditioned
souls are influenced by material nature, they can see only the actions and
reactions of material nature, but not the Supreme Personality of God-
head. One therefore must purify himself internally and externally:
apavitrah pavitro va
sarvavasthar gato pi va
yah smaret pundarikaksarn
sa bahyabhyantarah Sucih
To keep ourselves externally clean we should bathe three times daily,
and for internal cleanliness we must cleanse the heart by chanting the
Hare Krsna mantra. The members of the Krsna consciousness movement
must always follow this principle (bahyabhyantarah sucik). Then it will
one day be possible to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to
face.

TRANSLATION

O my Lord, sages freed from the influence of the three modes of
material nature—sages such as the four Kumaras [Sanat, Sanaka,
Sanandana and Sanatana] —are able to think of You, who are con-
centrated knowledge. But how can an ignorant person like me
think of You?

PURPORT

The word svabhava refers to one’s own spiritual nature or original
constitutional position. When situated in this original position, the living
entity is unaffected by the modes of material nature. Sa gunan
samatityaitan brahma-bhityaya kalpate (Bg. 14.26). As soon as one is
freed from the influence of the three modes of material nature, he is
situated on the Brahman platform. Vivid examples of personalities thus
situated are the four Kumairas and Narada. Such authorities can by
nature understand the position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
but a conditioned soul not freed from the influence of material nature is
unable to realize the Supreme. In Bhagavad-gita (2.45), therefore,
Krsna advises Arjuna, traigunya-visaya veda nistraigunyo bhavarjuna:
one must rise above the influence of the three modes of material nature.
One who stays within the influence of the three material modes is unable
to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

“By serving You constantly, one is freed from all material desires and is
completely pacified. When shall I engage as Your permanent eternal ser-
vant and always feel joyful to have such a fitting master?”

Manorathenasati dhavato bahih: one who acts on the mental platform
must descend to material activities. Material contamination, however, is
completely absent from the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His
pure devotee. Therefore the Lord is addressed as prasanta, completely
peaceful, free from the disturbances of material existence. The Supreme
Lord has no material name or form; only the foolish think that the Lord’s
name and form are material (avajananti mam midha manusirn tanum
dasritam). The identity of the Supreme Lord is that He is the original per-
son. Nonetheless, those who have but a poor fund of knowledge think
that the Lord is formless. The Lord is formless in the material sense, but
He has His transcendental form (sac-cid-ananda-vigraha).

being very merciful to him, explained to him the path of
knowledge.

The Author

His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada appeared in
this world in 1896 in Calcutta, India. He first met his spiritual master,
Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami, in Calcutta in 1922. Bhakti-
siddhanta Sarasvati, a prominent devotional scholar and the founder of
sixty-four Gaudiya Mathas (Vedic institutes), liked this educated young
man and convinced him to dedicate his life to teaching Vedic knowledge.
Srila Prabhupada became his student, and eleven years later (1933) at
Allahabad he became his formally initiated disciple.

At their first meeting, in 1922, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati
Thakura requested Srila Prabhupada to broadcast Vedic knowledge
through the English language. In the years that followed, Srila Prabhu-
pada wrote a commentary on the Bhagavad-gita, assisted the Gaudiya
Matha in its work and, in 1944, without assistance, started an English
fortnightly magazine, edited it, typed the manuscripts and checked the
galley proofs. He even distributed the individual copies freely and strug-
gled to maintain the publication. Once begun, the magazine never
stopped; it is now being continued by his disciples in the West.

Recognizing Srila Prabhupada’s philosophical learning and devotion,
the Gaudiya Vaisnava Society honored him in 1947 with the title
“Bhaktivedanta.” In 1950, at the age of fifty-four, Srila Prabhupada
retired from married life, and four years later he adopted the
vanaprastha (retired) order to devote more time to his studies and writ-
ing. Srila Prabhupada traveled to the holy city of Vrndavana, where he
lived in very humble circumstances in the historic medieval temple of
Radha-Damodara. There he engaged for several years in deep study and
writing. He accepted the renounced order of life (sannyasa) in 1959. At
Radha-Damodara, Srila Prabhupada began work on his life’s master-
piece: a multivolume translation and commentary on the eighteen thou-
sand verse Srimad-Bhagavatam (Bhagavata Purana). He also wrote
Easy Journey to Other Planets. |

After publishing three volumes of Bhagavatam, Srila Prabhupada
came to the United States, in 1965, to fulfill the mission of his spiritual
master. Since that time, His Divine Grace has written over forty volumes
of authoritative translations, commentaries and summary studies of the
philosophical and religious classics of India.

266 Srimad-Bhagavatam

In 1965, when he first arrived by freighter in New York City, Srila
Prabhupada was practically penniless. It was after almost a year of great
difficulty that he established the International Society for Krishna Con-
sciousness in July of 1966. Under his careful guidance, the Society has
grown within a decade to a worldwide confederation of almost one
hundred asramas, schools, temples, institutes and farm communities.

In 1968, Srila Prabhupada created New Vrndavana, an experimental
Vedic community in the hills of West Virginia. Inspired by the success of
New Vrndavana, now a thriving farm community of more than one thou-
sand acres, his students have since founded several similar communities
in the United States and abroad.

In 1972, His Divine Grace introduced the Vedic system of primary and
secondary education in the West by founding the Gurukula school in
Dallas, Texas. The school began with 3 children in 1972, and by the
beginning of 1975 the enrollment had grown to 150.

Srila Prabhupada has also inspired the construction of a large inter-
national center at Sridhama Mayapur in West Bengal, India, which is also
the site for a planned Institute of Vedic Studies. A similar project is the
magnificent Krsna-Balarama Temple and International Guest House in
Vrndavana, India. These are centers where Westerners can live to gain
firsthand experience of Vedic culture.

Srila Prabhupada’s most significant contribution, however, is his
books. Highly respected by the academic community for their authori-
tativeness, depth and clarity, they are used as standard textbooks in
numerous college courses. His writings have been translated into eleven
languages. The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, established in 1972 ex-
clusively to publish the works of His Divine Grace, has thus become the
world’s largest publisher of books in the field of Indian religion and phi-
losophy. Its latest project is the publishing of Srila Prabhupada’s most
recent work: a seventeen-volume translation and commentary —com-
pleted by Srila Prabhupada in only eighteen months—on the Bengali
religious classic Sri Caitanya-caritamrta. 3

In the past ten years, in spite of his advanced age, Srila Prabhupada
has circled the globe twelve times on lecture tours that have taken him to
six continents. In spite of such a vigorous schedule, Srila Prabhupada
continues to write prolifically. His writings constitute a veritable library
of Vedic philosophy, religion, literature and culture.
