Preface

We must know the present need of human society. And what is that
need? Human society is no longer bounded by geographical limits to par-
ticular countries or communities. Human society is broader than in the
Middle Ages, and the world tendency is toward one state or one human
society. The ideals of spiritual communism, according to Srimad-
Bhagavatam, are based more or less on the oneness of the entire human
society, nay, of the entire energy of living beings. The need is felt by
great thinkers to make this a successful ideology. Srirnad-Bhagavatam
will fill this need in human society. It begins, therefore, with the apho-
rism of Vedanta philosophy janmady asya yatah to establish the ideal of
a common cause.

Human society, at the present moment, is not in the darkness of
oblivion. It has made rapid progress in the field of material comforts,
education and economic development throughout the entire world. But
there is a pinprick somewhere in the social body at large, and therefore
there are large-scale quarrels, even over less important issues. There is
need of a clue as to how humanity can become one in peace, friendship
and prosperity with a common cause. Srimad-Bhagavatam will fill this
need, for it is a cultural presentation for the re-spiritualization of the
entire human society.

Srimad-Bhagavatam should be introduced also in the schools and col-
leges, for it is recommended by the great student-devotee Prahlida
Maharaja in order to change the demoniac face of society.

Disparity in human society is due to lack of principles in a godless
civilization. There is God, or the Almighty One, from whom everything
emanates, by whom everything is maintained and in whom everything

is merged to rest. Material science has tried to find the ultimate source
of creation very insufficiently, but it is a fact that there is one ulti-
mate source of everything that be. This ultimate source is explained
rationally and authoritatively in the beautiful Bhagavatam or Srimad-
Bhagavatam.

Srimad-Bhagavatam is the transcendental science not only for know-
ing the ultimate source of everything but also for knowing our relation
with Him and our duty towards perfection of the human society on the
basis of this perfect knowledge. It is powerful reading matter in the
Sanskrit language, and it is now rendered into English elaborately so that
simply by a careful reading one will know God perfectly well, so much so
that the reader will be sufficiently educated to defend himself from the
onslaught of atheists. Over and above this, the reader will be able to con-
vert others to accepting God as a concrete principle.

Srimad-Bhdgavatam begins with the definition of the ultimate source.
It is a bona fide commentary on the Vedanta-sitra by the same author,
Srila Vyasadeva, and gradually it develops into nine cantos up to the
highest state of God realization. The only qualification one needs to study
this great book of transcendental knowledge is to proceed step by step
cautiously and not jump forward haphazardly like with an ordinary
book. It should be gone through chapter by chapter, one after another.
The reading matter is so arranged with its original Sanskrit text, its
English transliteration, synonyms, translation and purports so that one is
sure to become a God-realized soul at the end of finishing the first nine
cantos.

The Tenth Canto is distinct from the first nine cantos because it deals
directly with the transcendental activities of the Personality of Godhead
Sri Krsna. One will be unable to capture the effects of the Tenth Canto
without going through the first nine cantos. The book is complete in
twelve cantos, each independent, but it is good for all to read them in
small installments one after another. ॥

I must admit my frailties in presenting Srimad-Bhagavatam, but still
I am hopeful of its good reception by the thinkers and leaders of society
on the strength of the following statement of Srimad-Bhagavatam
(1.5.11):

tad-vag-visargo janatagha-viplavo
yasmin prati-slokam abaddhavaty api

“On the other hand, that literature which is full with descriptions of the
transcendental glories of the name, fame, form and pastimes of the un-
limited Supreme Lord is a transcendental creation meant to bring about a
revolution in the impious life of a misdirected civilization. Such tran-
scendental literatures, even though irregularly composed, are heard,

sung and accepted by purified men who are thoroughly honest.”

Introduction

“This Bhagavata Purana is as brilliant as the sun, and it has arisen
just after the departure of Lord Krsna to His own abode, accompanied by
religion, knowledge, etc. Persons who have lost their vision due to the
dense darkness of ignorance in the age of Kali shall get light from this
Purana.” (Srimad-Bhagavatam 1.3.43)

The timeless wisdom of India is expressed in the Vedas, ancient
Sanskrit texts that touch upon all fields of human knowledge. Originally
preserved through oral tradition, the Vedas were first put into writing
five thousand years ago by Srila Vyasadeva, the ‘literary incarnation of
God.” After compiling the Vedas, Vyasadeva set forth their essence in
the aphorisms known as Vedanta-sitras. Srimad-Bhagavatam is
Vyasadeva’s commentary on his own Vedanta-siitras. It was written in
the maturity of his spiritual life under the direction of Narada Muni, his
spiritual master. Referred to as “‘the ripened fruit of the tree of Vedic
literature,” Srimad-Bhagavatam is the most complete and authoritative
exposition of Vedic knowledge.

After compiling the Bhagavatam, Vyasa impressed the synopsis of it
upon his son, the sage Sukadeva Gosvami. Sukadeva Gosvami subse-
quently recited the entire Bhagavatam to Maharaja Pariksit in an assem-
bly of learned saints on the bank of the Ganges at Hastinapura (now
Delhi). Maharaja Pariksit was the emperor of the world and was a great
rajarsi (saintly king). Having received a warning that he would die
within a week, he renounced his entire kingdom and retired to the bank
of the Ganges to fast until death and receive spiritual enlightenment.
The Bhagavatam begins with Emperor Pariksit’s sober inquiry to
Sukadeva Gosvami: “You are the spiritual master of great saints and
devotees. I am therefore begging you to show the way of perfection for
all persons, and especially for one who is about to die. Please let me know
what a man should hear, chant, remember and worship, and also what he
should not do. Please explain all this to me.”

Sukadeva Gosvami’s answer to this question, and numerous other
questions posed by Maharaja Pariksit, concerning everything from the
nature of the self to the origin of the universe, held the assembled sages

xiii

x Srimad-Bhagavatam

in rapt attention continuously for the seven days leading to the King’s
death. The sage Sata Gosvami, who was present on the bank of the
Ganges when Sukadeva Gosvami first recited Srimad-Bhagavatam, later
repeated the Bhagavatam before a gathering of sages in the forest of
Naimisaranya. Those sages, concerned about the spiritual welfare of the
people in general, had gathered to perform a long, continuous chain of
sacrifices to counteract the degrading influence of the incipient age of
Kali. In response to the sages’ request that he speak the essence of Vedic
wisdom, ৩008 Gosvami repeated from memory the entire eighteen thou-
sand verses of Srimad-Bhagavatam, as spoken by Sukadeva Gosvami to
Maharaja Pariksit.

The reader of Srimad-Bhdgavatam hears Sata Gosvami relate the
questions of Maharaja Pariksit and the answers of Sukadeva Gosvami.
Also, Sita Gosvami sometimes responds directly to questions put by
Saunaka Resi, the spokesman for the sages gathered at Naimisaranya. One
therefore simultaneously hears two dialogues: one between Maharaja
Pariksit and Sukadeva Gosvami on the bank of the Ganges, and another
at Naimisiranya between Sita Gosvami and the sages at Naimisaranya
Forest, headed by Saunaka Rsi. Furthermore, while instructing King
Pariksit, Sukadeva Gosvami often relates historical episodes and gives
accounts of lengthy philosophical discussions between such great souls as
the saint Maitreya and his disciple Vidura. With this understanding of
the history of the Bhagavatam, the reader will easily be able to follow its
intermingling of dialogues and events from various sources. Since philo-
sophical wisdom, not chronological order, is most important in the text,
one need only be attentive to the subject matter of Srimad-Bhagavatam
to appreciate fully its profound message.

The translator of this edition compares the Bhagavatam to sugar
candy—wherever you taste it, you will find it equally sweet and
relishable. Therefore, to taste the sweetness of the Bhagavatam, one may
begin by reading any of its volumes. After such an introductory taste,
however, the serious reader is best advised to go back to Volume One of
the First Canto and then proceed through the Bhagavatam, volume after
volume, in its natural order.

This edition of the Bhagavatam is the first complete English transla-
tion of this important text with an elaborate commentary, and it is the
first widely available to the English-speaking public. It is the product of

Introduction xv
the scholarly and devotional effort of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhakti-
vedanta Swami Prabhupada, the world’s most distinguished teacher of
Indian religious and philosophical thought. His consummate Sanskrit
scholarship and intimate familiarity with Vedic culture and thought as
well as the modern way of life combine to reveal to the West a magnifi-
cent exposition of this important classic.

Readers will find this work of value for many reasons. For those in-
terested in the classical roots of Indian civilization, it serves as a vast
reservoir of detailed information on virtually every one of its aspects.
For students of comparative philosophy and religion, the Bhagavatam
offers a penetrating view into the meaning of India’s profound spiritual
heritage. To sociologists and anthropologists, the Bhagavatam reveals the
practical workings of a peaceful and scientifically organized Vedic
culture, whose institutions were integrated on the basis of a highly
developed spiritual world view. Students of literature will discover the
Bhagavatam to be a masterpiece of majestic poetry. For students of psy-
chology, the text provides important perspectives on the nature of con-
sciousness, human behavior and the philosophical study of identity.
Finally, to those seeking spiritual insight, the Bhagavatam offers simple
and practical guidance for attainment of the highest self-knowledge and
realization of the Absolute Truth. The entire multivolume text, pre-
sented by the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, promises to occupy a significant
place in the intellectual, cultural and spiritual life of modern man for a
long time to come.

CHAPTER NINE
The Dynasty of Armm$uman
This chapter describes the history of the dynasty of Ams$uman, up to
Khatvanga, and it also describes how Bhagiratha brought the water of the
Ganges to this earth.

The son of Maharaja Am$uman was Dilipa, who tried to bring the
Ganges to this world but who died without success. Bhagiratha, the son of
Dilipa, was determined to bring the Ganges to the material world, and for
this purpose he underwent severe austerities. Mother Ganges, being fully
satisfied by his austerities, made herself visible to him, wanting to give
him a benediction. Bhagiratha then asked her to deliver his forefathers.
Although mother Ganges agreed to come down to earth, she made two
conditions: first, she wanted some suitable male to be able to control her
waves; second, although all sinful men would be freed from sinful reac-
tions by bathing in the Ganges, mother Ganges did not want to keep all
these sinful reactions. These two conditions were subject matters for con-
sideration. Bhagiratha replied to mother Ganges, “The Personality of
Godhead Lord Siva will be completely able to control the waves of your
water, and when pure devotees bathe in your water, the sinful reactions
left by sinful men will be counteracted.” Bhagiratha then performed
austerities to satisfy Lord Siva, who is called Asutosa because he is
naturally satisfied very easily. Lord Siva agreed to Bhagiratha’s proposal
to check the force of the Ganges. In this way, simply by the touch of the
Ganges, Bhagiratha’s forefathers were delivered and allowed to go to the
heavenly planets. | |

The son of Bhagiratha was Sruta, the son of Sruta was Nabha, and
Nabha’s son was Sindhudvipa. The son of Sindhudvipa was Ayutayu, and
the son of Ayutayu was Rtiparna, who was a friend of Nala. Rtiparna
gave Nala the art of gambling and learned from him the art of asva-
vidya. The son of Rtiparna was known as Sarvakama, the son of
Sarvakama was Sudasa, and his son was Saudasa. The wife of Saudasa
was named Damayanti or Madayanti, and Saudasa was also known as

1


--- Page 9 ---
2 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 9
Kalmasapada. Because of some defect in his fruitive activities, Saudasa
was cursed by Vasistha to become a Raksasa. While walking through the
forest, he saw a brahmana engaged in sex with his wife, and because he
had become 8 Riksasa he wanted to devour the brahmana. Although the
brahmana’s wife pleaded with him in many ways, Saudasa devoured the
brahmana, and the wife therefore cursed him, saying, “As soon as you
engage in sex you will die.”” After twelve years, therefore, even though
Saudasa was released from the curse of Vasistha Muni, he remained son-
less. At that time, with Saudasa’s permission, Vasistha impregnated
Saudasa’s wife, Madayanti. Because Madayanti bore the child for many
years but still could not give birth, Vasistha struck her abdomen with a
stone, and thus a son was born. The son was named Asmaka.

The son of A$maka was known as Balika. He was protected from the
curse of Parasurama because of being surrounded by many women, and
therefore he is also known as Narikavaca. When the entire world was de-
void of ksatriyas, he became the original father of more ksatriyas. He is
therefore sometimes called Malaka. From Balika, Dasaratha was born,
from Dasaratha came Aidavidi, and from Aidavidi came Vi§vasaha. The
son of Visvasaha was Maharaja Khatvanga. Maharaja Khatvanga joined
the demigods in fighting the demons and was victorious, and the
demigods therefore wanted to give him a benediction. But when the King
inquired how long he would live and understood that his life would last
only a few seconds more, he immediately left the heavenly planets and
returned to his own abode by airplane. He could understand that every-
thing in this material world is insignificant, and thus he fully engaged in
worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari.

PURPORT
The Supreme Personality of Godhead says:
sarva-dharman parityajya
mam ekarh Saranarn vraja
ahari (एदा! sarva-papebhyo
moksayisyami ma Sucah
“Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall
deliver you from all sinful reaction. Do not fear.” (Bg.18.66) The
Supreme Personality of Godhead can accept the reactions of anyone’s sin-
ful deeds and neutralize them because He is pavitra, pure, like the sun,
which is never contaminated by any worldly infection. Tejiyasarn na
dosaya vahneh sarva-bhujo yatha (Bhag. 10.33.29). One who is very
powerful is not affected by any sinful activity. But here we see that
mother Ganges fears being burdened with the sins of the people in
general who would bathe in her waters. This indicates that no one but the
Supreme Personality of Godhead is able to neutralize the reactions of sin-
ful deeds, whether one’s own or those of others. Sometimes the spiritual
master, after accepting a disciple, must take charge of that disciple’s past
sinful activities and, being overloaded, must sometimes suffer—if not
fully, then partially —for the sinful acts of the disciple. Every disciple,
therefore, must be very careful not to commit sinful activities after ini-
tiation. The poor spiritual master is kind and merciful enough to accept a
disciple and partially suffer for that disciples sinful activities, but
Krsna, being merciful to His servant, neutralizes the reactions of sinful
deeds for the servant who engages in preaching His glories. Even mother
Ganges feared the sinful reactions of the people in general and was anx-
ious about how she would counteract the burden of these sins.

TRANSLATION

Bhagiratha said: Those who are saintly because of devotional
service and are therefore in the renounced order, free from ma-
terial desires, and who are pure devotees, expert in following the
regulative principles mentioned in the Vedas, are always glorious
and pure in behavior and are able to deliver all fallen souls. When
such pure devotees bathe in your water, the sinful reactions ac-
cumulated from other people will certainly be counteracted, for
such devotees always keep in the core of their hearts the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, who can vanquish all sinful reactions.

PURPORT

Mother Ganges is available to everyone for bathing. Therefore, not
only will sinful persons bathe in the Ganges water, but in Hardwar and
other holy places where the Ganges flows, saintly persons and devotees
will also bathe in the waters of the Ganges. Devotees and saintly persons
advanced in the renounced order can deliver even the Ganges. Tirthi-
kurvanti tirthani svantah-sthena gadabhrta (Bhag. 1.13.10). Because
saintly devotees always keep the Lord within the core of their hearts,
they can perfectly cleanse the holy places of all sinful reactions.


--- Page 15 ---
8 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 9
Therefore, people in general must always respectfully honor saintly per-
sons. It is ordered that as soon as one sees a Vaisnava, or even a sannydsi,
one should immediately offer respects to such a holy man. If one forgets
to show respect in this way, one must observe a fast for that day. This is a
Vedic injunction. One must be extremely careful to refrain from commit-
ting offenses at the lotus feet of a devotee or saintly person.

There are methods of prayascitta, or atonement, but they are inade-
quate to cleanse one of sinful reactions. One can be cleansed of sinful
reactions only by devotional service, as stated in regard to the history of
Ajamila:

kecit kevalaya bhaktya
vasudeva-parayanah
aghar dhunvanti kartsnyena
ntharam iva bhaskarah
“Only a rare person who has adopted complete, unalloyed devotional ser-
vice to Krsna can uproot the weeds of sinful actions with no possibility
that they will revive. He can do this simply by discharging devotional
service, just as the sun can immediately dissipate fog by its rays.”
(Bhag. 6.1.15) If one is under the protection of a devotee and sincerely
renders service unto him, by this process of bhakti-yoga one is certainly
able to counteract all sinful reactions.

TRANSLATION

Like a cloth woven of threads extending for its length and
breadth, this entire universe, in all its latitude and longitude, is
situated under different potencies of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Lord Siva is the incarnation of the Lord, and thus he
represents the Supersoul in the embodied soul. He can sustain
your forceful waves on his head.

PURPORT

The water of the Ganges is supposed to rest on the head of Lord Siva.
Lord Siva is an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who
sustains the entire universe by different potencies. Lord Siva is described
in the Brahma-samhita (5.45):

ksiram yatha dadhi vikara-visesa-yogat
sajayate na hi tatah prthag asti hetoh
yah Sambhutam api tatha samupaiti karyad
govindam adi-purusari tam ahari bhajami

“Milk changes into yogurt when mixed with a yogurt culture, but ac-
tually yogurt is constitutionally nothing but milk. Similarly, Govinda,
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, assumes the form of Lord Siva for
the special purpose of material transactions. I offer my obeisances at Lord
Govinda’s lotus feet.” Lord Siva is the Supreme Personality of Godhead
in the same sense that yogurt is also milk although at the same time it is
not milk. For the maintenance of the material world there are three in-
carnations —Brahma, Visnu and Maheévara (Lord Siva). Lord Siva is
Visnu in an incarnation for the mode of ignorance. The material world
exists predominantly in the mode of ignorance. Therefore Lord Siva is
compared here to the longitude and latitude of the entire universe, which
resembles a cloth woven of threads extending for both its length and
breadth.

TRANSLATION
After saying this, Bhagiratha satisfied Lord Siva by performing
austerities. O King Pariksit, Lord Siva was very quickly satisfied
with Bhagiratha.
PURPORT
The words asv atusyata indicate that Lord Siva was satisfied very soon.
Therefore another name for Lord Siva is ASutosa. Materialistic persons
become attached to Lord Siva because Lord Siva bestows benedictions
upon anyone and everyone very quickly, not caring to know how his
devotees prosper or suffer. Although materialistic persons know that ma-
terial happiness is nothing but another side of suffering, they want it,
and to get it very quickly they worship Lord Siva. We find that ma-
terialists are generally devotees of many demigods, especially Lord Siva
and mother Durga. They do not actually want spiritual happiness, for it
is almost unknown to them. But if one is serious about being happy spiri-
tually, he must take shelter of Lord Visnu, as the Lord personally
demands:

TRANSLATION
When King Bhagiratha approached Lord Siva and requested him
to sustain the forceful waves of the Ganges, Lord Siva accepted the
proposal by saying, “Let it be so.” Then, with great attention, he
sustained the Ganges on his head, for the water of the Ganges is
purifying, having emanated from the toes of Lord Visnu.

who were thus sprinkled with water from the Ganges.

TRANSLATION
Because the sons of Sagara Maharaja had offended a great per-
sonality, the heat of their bodies had increased, and they were
burnt to ashes. But simply by being sprinkled with water from the
Ganges, all of them became eligible to go to the heavenly planets.
What then is to be said of those who use the water of mother
Ganges to worship her?
PURPORT
Mother Ganges is worshiped by the water of the Ganges: a devotee
takes a little water from the Ganges and offers it back to the Ganges.
When the devotee takes the water, mother Ganges does not lose any-
thing, and when the water is offered back, mother Ganges does not in-
crease, but in this way the worshiper of the Ganges is benefited.
Similarly, a devotee of the Lord offers the Lord patram puspar phalarir
toyam—a leaf, flower, fruit or water —in great devotion, but everything,
including the leaf, flower, fruit and water, belongs to the Lord, and
therefore there is nothing to renounce or to accept. One must simply take
advantage of the bhakti process because by following this process one
does not lose anything but one gains the favor of the Supreme Person.

Simply by having water from the Ganges come in contact with
the ashes of their burnt bodies, the sons of Sagara Maharaja were
elevated to the heavenly planets. Therefore, what is to be said of a

TRANSLATION
Because mother Ganges emanates from the lotus toe of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Anantadeva, she is able to liber-
ate one from material bondage. Therefore whatever is described
herewith about her is not at all wonderful.
PURPORT
It has actually been seen that anyone who regularly worships mother
Ganges simply by bathing in her water keeps very good health and
gradually becomes a devotee of the Lord. This is the effect of bathing in
the water of the Ganges. Bathing in the Ganges is recommended in all
Vedic $astras, and one who takes to this path will certainly be completely
freed from all sinful reactions. The practical example of this is that the
sons of Maharaja Sagara went to the heavenly planets when water from
the Ganges merely touched the ashes of their burnt bodies.

TRANSLATION
Bhagiratha had a son named Sruta, whose son was Nabha. This
son was different from the Nabha previously described. Nabha had
a son named Sindhudvipa, from Sindhudvipa came Ayutayu, and
from Ayutayu came Rtiiparna, who became a friend of Nalaraja.
Rtaparna taught Nalaraja the art of gambling, and Nalaraja gave
Rtaparna lessons in controlling and maintaining horses. The son
of Rtiiparna was Sarvakama.
PURPORT
Gambling is also an art. Ksatriyas are allowed to exhibit talent in this
art of gambling. By the grace of Krsna, the Pandavas lost everything by
gambling and were deprived of their kingdom, wife, family and home
because they were not expert in the gambling art. In other words, a devo-
tee may not be expert in materialistic activities. It is therefore advised in
the sastra that materialistic activities are not at all suitable for the living
entities, especially the devotees. A devotee should therefore be satisfied
to eat whatever is sent as prasida by the Supreme Lord. A devotee
remains pure because he does not take to sinful activities such as gam-
bling, intoxication, meat-eating and illicit sex.

preparing to curse Vasistha, but his wife, Madayanti, forbade him
to do so. Then the King saw that the ten directions, the sky and the
surface of the globe were full of living entities everywhere.

PURPORT
Srila Narottama dasa Thakura has sung:
hari hari viphale janama gondinu
manusya-janama patya, radha-krsna na bhajiya,
janiya Suniya visa khainu
The body of a human being is extremely valuable because in this body
one can understand the instructions of Krsna and attain the ultimate
destination of the living entity. The living entity is within the material
world to fulfill the mission of going back home, back to Godhead. In the
material world, one hankers for happiness, but because one does not
know the ultimate destination, one changes bodies one after another.
However, if one gets the opportunity to possess a human form of body, in
this body he can fulfill the four principles of dharma, artha, kama and
moksa, and if one is properly regulated he makes further progress, after
liberation, to engage in the service of Radha and Krsna. This is the suc-
cess of life: to stop the process of repeated birth and death and go back
home, back to Godhead (mam eti), to be engaged in the service of Radha
and Krsna. Therefore, taking a human body is meant for completing
one’s progress in life. Throughout human society, killing of a human
being is taken very seriously. Hundreds and thousands of animals are
killed in slaughterhouses, and no one cares about them, but the killing of
even one human being is taken very seriously. Why? Because the human
form of body is extremely important in executing the mission of life.

TRANSLATION
Here is a learned, highly qualified brahmana, engaged in per-
forming austerity and eagerly desiring to worship the Supreme
Lord, the Supersoul who lives within the core of the heart in all
living entities.
PURPORT
The wife of the brahmana did not regard her husband as a superficial
brahmana who was called a brahmana merely because he was born of a
brahmana family. Rather, this brahmana was actually qualified with the
brahminical symptoms. Yasya yal laksanar proktam (Bhag. 7.11.35).
The symptoms of a brahmana are stated in the astra:
Samo damas tapah 501८077४
ksantir arjavam eva ca
JAdanarn vijianam astikyar
brahma-karma svabhavajam
“Peacefulness, self-control, austerity, purity, tolerance, honesty,
wisdom, knowledge, and religiousness —these are the qualities by which
the brahmanas work.” (Bg.18.42) Not only must a brahmana be
qualified, but he must also engage in actual brahminical activities.
Simply to be qualified is not enough; one must engage in a brahmana’s
duties. The duty of a brahmana is to know the parari brahma, Krsna


--- Page 33 ---
26 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 9
(00707 brahma param dhama pavitram paramariv bhavan). Because
this brahmana was actually qualified and was also engaged in brahmini-
cal activities (brahma-karma), killing him would be a greatly sinful act,
and the brahmana’s wife requested that he not be killed.

My lord, you are completely aware of the religious principles. As
a son never deserves to be killed by his father, here is a brahmana
who should be protected by the king, and never killed. How does
he deserve to be killed by a rajarsi like you?
PURPORT
The word rajarsi refers to a king who behaves like a rsi, or sage. Such
a king is also called naradeva because he is considered a representative
of the Supreme Lord. Because his duty is to rule the kingdom to maintain
brahminical culture, he never desires to kill a brahmana. Generally, a
brahmana, woman, child, old man or cow is never regarded as punish-
able. Thus the wife of the brahmana requested the King to refrain from
this sinful act.

TRANSLATION

You are well known and worshiped in learned circles. How dare
you kill this brahmana, who is a saintly, sinless person, well versed
in Vedic knowledge? Killing him would be like destroying the
embryo within the womb or killing a cow.

PURPORT

As stated in the Amara-kosa dictionary, bhrino ‘rbhake bala-garbhe:
the word bhrina refers either to the cow or to the living entity in
embryo. According to Vedic culture, destroying the undeveloped embryo
of the soul in the womb is as sinful as killing a cow or a brahmana. In the
embryo, the living entity is present in an undeveloped stage. The modern
scientific theory that life is a combination of chemicals is nonsense;
scientists cannot manufacture living beings, even like those born from
eggs. The idea that scientists can develop a chemical situation resembling
that of an egg and bring life from it is nonsensical. Their theory that a
chemical combination can have life may be accepted, but these rascals
cannot create such a combination. This verse refers to bhrinasya
vadham —the killing of a bhrina or destruction of the embryo. Here is a
challenge from the Vedic literature. The crude, atheistic understanding


--- Page 35 ---
28 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 9
that the living entity is a combination of matter belongs to the grossest
ignorance.

TRANSLATION
Without my husband, I cannot live for a moment. If you want to

husband I am as good as a dead body.
PURPORT
In the Vedic culture there is a system known as sati or saha-marana,
in which a woman dies with her husband. According to this system, if the
husband dies, the wife will voluntarily die by falling in the blazing
funeral pyre of her husband. Here, in this verse, the feelings inherent in
this culture are expressed by the wife of the brahmana. A woman with-
out a husband is like a dead body. Therefore according to Vedic culture a
girl must be married. This is the responsibility of her father. A girl may
be given in charity, and a husband may have more than one wife, but a
girl must be married. This is Vedic culture. A woman is supposed to be
always dependent —in her childhood she is dependent on her father, in
youth on her husband, and in old age on her elderly sons. According to
Manu-sarhita, she is never independent. Independence for a woman


--- Page 36 ---
Text 33] The Dynasty of Amsuman 29
means miserable life. In this age, so many girls are unmarried and falsely
imagining themselves free, but their life is miserable. Here is an instance
in which a woman felt that without her husband she was nothing but a
dead body.

TRANSLATION

Being condemned by the curse of Vasistha, King Saudasa de-
voured the brahmana, exactly as a tiger eats its prey. Even though
the brahmana’s wife spoke so pitiably, Saudasa was unmoved by
her lamentation.

PURPORT

This is an example of destiny. King Saudasa was condemned by the
curse of Vasistha, and therefore even though he was well qualified he
could not restrain himself from becoming a tigerlike Raksasa, for this
was his destiny. Tal Ilabhyate duhkhavad anyatah sukham
(Bhag. 1.5.18). As one is put into distress by destiny, destiny can also put
one in a happy situation. Destiny is extremely strong, but one can change
destiny if one comes to the platform of Krsna consciousness. Karmani

King Khatvanga was unconquerable in any fight. Requested by
the demigods to join them in fighting the demons, he won victory,
and the demigods, being very pleased, wanted to give him a
benediction. The King inquired from them about the duration of
his life and was informed that he had only one moment more.
Thus he immediately left his palace and went to his own residence,
where he engaged his mind fully on the lotus feet of the Lord.
PURPORT
The example of Maharaja Khatvanga in performing devotional service
is brilliant. Maharaja Khatvanga engaged himself for only a moment in
devotional service to the Lord, but he was promoted back to Godhead.
Therefore, if one practices devotional service from the beginning of his
life, surely he will return home, back to Godhead, without a doubt
(asarisaya).
In Bhagavad-gita the word asamsaya is used to describe the devotee.
There the Lord Himself gives this instruction:
mayy asakta-manah partha
yogam yufijan mad-asrayah
asamsayari samagrariv mari
yatha jaasyasi tac chrnu
“Now hear, 0 son of Prtha [Arjuna], how by practicing yoga in full con-
sciousness of Me, with mind attached to Me, you can know Me in full,
free from doubt.” (Bg. 7.1)


--- Page 43 ---
36 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 9
The Lord also instructs:
Jjanma karma ca me divyam
evam yo vetti tattvatah
tyaktva deham punar janma
naiti mam ९८ so ‘rjuna
“One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and ac-
tivities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this ma-
terial world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.” (Bg. 4.9)
Therefore, from the very beginning of one’s life one should practice
bhakti-yoga, which increases one’s attachment for Krsna. If one daily
sees the Deity in the temple, makes offerings by worshiping the Deity,
chants the holy name of the Personality of Godhead, and preaches about
the glorious activities of the Lord as much as possible, he thus becomes
attached to Krsna. This attachment is called asakti. When one’s mind is
attached to Krsna (mayy asakta-manah), one can fulfill the mission of
life in one human birth. If one misses this opportunity, one does not
know where he is going, how long he will remain in the cycle of birth
and death, and when he will again achieve the human form of life and
the chance to return home, back to Godhead. The most intelligent per-
son, therefore, uses every moment of his life to render loving service to
the Lord.

TRANSLATION

Maharaja Khatvanga thought: Not even my life is dearer to me
than the brahminical culture and the brahmanas, who are
worshiped by my family. What then is to be said of my kingdom,
land, wife, children and opulence? Nothing is dearer to me than
the brahmanas.

PURPORT

Maharaja Khatvanga, being in favor of the brahminical culture,
wanted to utilize one moment’s time by fully surrendering unto the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord is worshiped with this
prayer:

namo brahmanya-devaya
go brahmana-hitaya ca
Jjagad-dhitaya krsnaya
govindaya namo namah
“I offer my respectful obeisances to the Supreme Absolute Truth, Krsna,
who is the well-wisher of the cows and the brahmanas as well as the liv-
ing entities in general. I offer my repeated obeisances to Govinda, who is
the pleasure reservoir for all the senses.” A devotee of Krsna is very
much attached to brahminical culture. Indeed, an expert personality who
knows who Krsna is and what He wants is a real brahmana. Brahma
janatiti brahmanah. Krsna is the Parabrahman, and therefore all Krsna
conscious persons, or devotees of Krsna, are exalted brahmanas.
Khatvanga Maharaja regarded the devotees of Krsna as the real
brahmanas and the real light for human society. One who desires to ad-
vance in Krsna consciousness and spiritual understanding must give the
utmost importance to brahminical culture and must understand Krsna
(krsndya govindaya). Then his life will be successful.

TRANSLATION

I was never attracted, even in my childhood, by insignificant

PURPORT

Maharaja Khatvanga provides a typical example of a Krsna conscious
person. A Krsna conscious person does not see anything to be important
but the Supreme Personality of Godhead, nor does he accept anything
within this material world as being unconnected to the Supreme Lord. As
stated in Caitanya-caritamrta (Madhya 8.274):

sthavara-jarigama dekhe, na dekhe tara mirti
sarvatra haya nija ista-deva-sphiirti

“The maha-bhagavata, the advanced devotee, certainly sees everything
mobile and immobile, but he does not exactly see their forms. Rather,
everywhere he immediately sees manifest the form of the Supreme
Lord.” Although a devotee is within the material world, he has no con-
nection with it. Nirbandhah krsna-sambandhe. He accepts this material
world in relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A devo-
tee may be engaged in earning money, but he uses that money for
propagating the Krsna consciousness movement by constructing large
temples and establishing worship of the Supreme Personality of God-
head. Khatvanga Maharaja, therefore, was not a materialist. A materialist


--- Page 46 ---
Text 45] The Dynasty of AmSumin 39
is always attached to wife, children, home, property and many other
things for sense gratification, but, as stated above, Khatvanga Maharaja
was not attached to such things, nor could he think of anything existing
without the purpose of the Supreme Lord. Isavasyam idam sarvam:
everything is related to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Of course,
this consciousness is not for the ordinary person, but if one takes to the
path of devotional service, as prescribed in The Nectar of Devotion, he
can be trained in this consciousness and attain perfect understanding.
For a Krsna conscious person, nothing is palatable without a relationship
with Krsna.

head than in all material benedictions.


--- Page 47 ---
40 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 9
PURPORT

A devotee is always transcendentally situated. Param drstva nivartate:
one who has seen the Supreme Personality of Godhead is no longer in-
terested in material sense enjoyment. Even such an exalted devotee as
Dhruva Maharaja went to the forest for the sake of material benefit, but
when he actually saw the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he refused to
accept any material benediction. He said, svamin krtartho ’smi vararm na
yace: “My dear Lord, I am fully satisfied with whatever You have given
me or not given me. I have nothing to ask from You, for I am fully
satisfied to be engaged in Your service.” This is the mentality of a pure
devotee, who does not want anything, material or spiritual, from the Per-
sonality of Godhead. Our Krsna consciousness movement is therefore
called krsna-bhavanamrta-sarigha, the association of persons who are
simply satisfied in thoughts of Krsna. Being absorbed in thoughts of
Krsna is neither expensive nor troublesome. Krsna says, man-mana
bhava mad-bhakto mad-yaji mari namaskuru: “Engage your mind al-
ways in thinking of Me, offer obeisances and worship Me.” (Bg. 9.34)
Anyone can always think of Krsna, without difficulties or obstacles.
This is called Arsna-bhavanamrta. One who is absorbed in krsna-
bhavanamrta has no material benefits to ask from Krsna. Instead, such a
person prays to the Lord for the benediction of being able to spread His
glories all over the world. Mama janmani janmanisvare bhavatad
bhaktir ahaituki tvayi. A Krsna conscious person does not even want to
stop his cycle of birth and death. He simply prays, “I may take birth as
You like, but my only prayer is that I may be engaged in Your service.”

TRANSLATION

Even though the demigods have the advantages of being situated
in the higher planetary system, their minds, senses and intelli-
gence are agitated by material conditions. Therefore, even such
elevated persons fail to realize the Supreme Personality of God-
head, who is eternally situated in the core of the heart. What then
is to be said of others, such as human beings, who have fewer
advantages?

PURPORT

It is a fact that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is always situated
in everyone’s heart (isvarah sarva-bhatanarr hrd-dese ’rjuna tisthati).
But because of our material anxieties, which are inevitable in this ma-
terial world, we cannot understand the Supreme Lord, although He is
situated so near to us. For those always agitated by material conditions,
the yogic process is recommended so that one may concentrate his
mind upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead within the heart.
Dhyanavasthita-tad-gatena manasa pasyanti yarn yoginah. Because in
material conditions the mind and senses are always agitated, by the yogic
procedures like dharana, asana and dhyana one must quiet the mind
and concentrate it upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In other
words, the yogic process is a material attempt to realize the Lord,
whereas bhakti, devotional service, is the spiritual process by which to
realize Him. Maharaja Khatvanga accepted the spiritual path, and
therefore he was no longer interested in anything material. Krsna says in
Bhagavad-gita (18.55), bhaktya mam abhijanati: “Only by devotional
service can | be understood.” One can understand Krsna, the
Parabrahman, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, only through devo-
tional service. The Lord never says that one can understand Him by per-
forming mystic yoga or by philosophically speculating. Bhakti is above
all such material attempts. Anyabhilasita-sinyarn jiana-karmady-

pious activities.

Therefore I should now give up my attachment for things

the external energy of the Lord, is like an imaginary town vi-
sualized on a hill or in a forest. Every conditioned soul has a
natural attraction and attachment for material things, but one
must simply give up this attachment and surrender unto the
Supreme Personality of Godhead.

PURPORT
When passing through a mountainous region in an airplane, one may

sometimes see a city in the sky with towers and palaces, or one may see
similar things in a big forest. This is called a gandharva-pura, a phan-
tasmagoria. This entire world resembles such a phantasmagoria, and
every materially situated person has attachment for it. But Khatvanga
Maharaja, because of his advanced Krsna consciousness, was not in-
terested in such things. Even though a devotee may engage in apparently
materialistic activities, he knows his position very well. Nirbandhah
krsna-sambandhe yuktar vairagyam ucyate. If one engages all material
things in relation with the loving service of the Lord, one is situated in
yukta-vairagya, proper renunciation. In this material world, nothing
should be accepted for one’s sense gratification: everything should be ac-
cepted for the service of the Lord. This is the mentality of the spiritual
world. Maharaja Khatvanga advises that one give up material attach-
ments and surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus
one achieves success in life. This is pure bhakti-yoga, which involves
vairagya-vidya —renunciation and knowledge.

“Let me surrender unto the Personality of Godhead who has appeared
now as Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. He is the ocean of all mercy and
has come down to teach us material detachment, learning and devotional
service to Himself.” (Caitanya-candrodaya-nataka 6.74) Sri Krsna
Caitanya Mahaprabhu inaugurated this movement of vairagya-vidya, by
which one detaches himself from material existence and engages in lov-
ing devotional service. The Krsna consciousness movement of devotional
service is the only process by which to counteract our false prestige in
this material world.

TRANSLATION
Thus Maharaja Khatvanga, by his advanced intelligence in ren-
dering service to the Lord, gave up false identification with the
body full of ignorance. In his original position of eternal servitor-
ship, he engaged himself in rendering service to the Lord.
PURPORT
When one actually becomes purely Krsna conscious, no one has any
right to rule over him. When situated in Krsna consciousness, one is no
longer in the darkness of ignorance, and when freed from all such dark-
ness, one is situated in his original position. Jivera ‘svaripa’ haya—
krsnera ‘nitya-dasa.’” The living entity is eternally the servant of the
Lord, and thus when he engages himself in the service of the Lord in all
respects, he enjoys the perfection of life.

TRANSLATION
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vasudeva, Krsna, is ex-
tremely difficult to understand for unintelligent men who accept
Him as impersonal or void, which He is not. The Lord is therefore
understood and sung about by pure devotees.
PURPORT
As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.11):
vadanti tat tattva-vidas
tattvari yaj jiianam advayam
brahmeti paramatmeti
bhagavan iti sabdyate
The Absolute Truth is realized in three phases—as Brahman,
Paramitma and Bhagavan. Bhagavan is the origin of everything. Brah-
man is a partial representation of Bhagavan, and Vasudeva, the Super-
soul living everywhere and in everyone’s heart, is also an advanced
realization of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But when one comes
to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead (vdasudevah sarvam
iti), when one realizes that Vasudeva is both Paramatma and the imper-
sonal Brahman, he is then in perfect knowledge. Krsna is therefore de-
scribed by Arjuna as param brahma param dhama pavitram paramam
bhavan. The words param brahma refer to the shelter of the impersonal
Brahman and also of the all-pervading Supersoul. When Krsna says
tyaktva dehar punar janma naiti mam eti, this means that the perfect


--- Page 53 ---
46 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 9
devotee, after perfect realization, returns home, back to Godhead.
Maharaja Khatvanga accepted the shelter of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, and because of his full surrender he achieved perfection.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Ninth
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “The Dynasty of
Amsuman.”

CHAPTER TEN
The Pastimes of
the Supreme Lord, Ramacandra
This Tenth Chapter describes how Lord Ramacandra appeared in the
dynasty of Maharaja Khatvanga. It also describes the Lord’s activities,
telling how He killed Ravana and returned to Ayodhya, the capital of His
kingdom.

The son of Maharaja Khatvanga was Dirghabahu, and his son was
Raghu. The son of Raghu was Aja, the son of Aja was Dasaratha, and the
son of Dadaratha was Lord Ramacandra, the Supreme Personality of God-
head. When the Lord descended into this world in His full quadruple ex-
pansion —as Lord Ramacandra, Laksmana, Bharata and Satrughna—
great sages like Valmiki who were actually in knowledge of the Absolute
Truth described His transcendental pastimes. Srila Sukadeva Gosvami
describes these pastimes in brief.

Lord Ramacandra went with Visvamitra and killed Raksasas like
Marica. After breaking the stout and strong bow known as Haradhanu,
the Lord married mother Sita and cut down the prestige of Parasurama.
To obey the order of His father, He entered the forest, accompanied by
Laksmana and Sita. There He cut off the nose of Sirpanakha and killed
the associates of Ravana, headed by Khara and Dusana. Ravana’s kidnap-
ping of Sitadevi was the beginning of this demon’s misfortune. When
Marica assumed the form of a golden deer, Lord Ramacandra went to
bring the deer to please Sitadevi, but in the meantime Ravana took ad-
vantage of the Lord’s absence to kidnap her. When Sitadevi was kid-
napped, Lord Ramacandra, accompanied by Laksmana, searched for her
throughout the forest. In the course of this search, They met Jatayu.
Then the Lord killed the demon Kabandha and the commander Vili and
established a friendly relationship with Sugriva. After organizing the
military strength of the monkeys and going with them to the shore of the
sea, the Lord awaited the arrival of Samudra, the ocean personified, but
when Samudra did not come, the Lord, the master of Samudra, became

47


--- Page 55 ---
48 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 10
angry. Then Samudra came to the Lord with great haste and surrendered
to Him, wanting to help Him in every way. The Lord then attempted to
bridge the ocean, and, with the help of advice from Vibhisana, He at-
tacked Ravana’s capital, Lanka. Previously, Hanuman, the eternal ser-
vant of the Lord, had set fire to Lanka, and now, with the help of
Laksmana, the forces of Lord Rimacandra killed all the Raksasa soldiers.
Then Lord Ramacandra personally killed Ravana. Mandodari and other
wives lamented for Ravana, and in accordance with Lord Rimacandra’s
order, Vibhisana performed the funeral ceremonies for all the dead in
the family. Lord Ramacandra then gave Vibhisana the right to rule
Lanka and also granted him a long duration of life. The Lord delivered
Sitadevi from the Asoka forest and carried her in a flower airplane to His
capital Ayodhya, where He was received by His brother Bharata. When
Lord Ramacandra entered Ayodhya, Bharata brought His wooden shoes,
Vibhisana and Sugriva held a whisk and fan, Hanuman carried an
umbrella, Satrughna carried the Lord’s bow and two quivers, and
Sitadevi carried a waterpot containing water from holy places. Angada
carried a sword, and Jambavan (Rksarija) carried a shield. After Lord
Ramacandra, accompanied by Lord Laksmana and mother Sitadevi, met
all His relatives, the great sage Vasistha enthroned Him as King. The
chapter ends with a short description of Lord Ramacandra’s rule in
Ayodhya.

PURPORT
, Lord Ramacandra and His brothers, Laksmana, Bharata and
Satrughna, are all visnu-tattva, not jiva-tattva. The Supreme Personality
of Godhead expands into many, many forms. Advaitam acyutam anadim
ananta-rigpam. Although they are one and the same, visnu-tattva has
many forms and incarnations. As confirmed in the Brahma-sarhita
(5.39), ramadi-mirtisu kala-niyamena tisthan. The Lord is situated in
many forms, such as Rama, Laksmana, Bharata and Satrughna, and these
forms may exist in any part of His creation. All these forms exist perma-
nently, eternally, as individual Personalities of Godhead, and they
resemble many candles, i all equally powerful. Lord Ramacandra,
Laksmana, Bharata and Satrughna, who, being visnu-tattva, are all
equally powerful, became the sons of Maharaja Dasaratha in response to
prayers by the demigods.

TRANSLATION
O King Pariksit, the transcendental activities of Lord Rama-
candra have been described by great saintly persons who have seen
the truth. Because you have heard again and again about Lord
Ramacandra, the husband of mother Sita, I shall describe these ac-
tivities only in brief. Please listen.
PURPORT
Modern Raksasas, posing as educationally advanced merely because
they have doctorates, have tried to prove that Lord Ramacandra is not the
Supreme Personality of Godhead but an ordinary person. But those who
are learned and spiritually advanced will never accept such notions; they
will accept the descriptions of Lord Ramacandra and His activities only as
presented by tattva-darsis, those who know the Absolute Truth. In
Bhagavad-gita (4.34) the Supreme Personality of Godhead advises:
tad viddhi pranipatena
pariprasnena sevaya
upadeksyanti te jiianari
jAdninas tattva-darsinah
“Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire
from him submissively and render service unto him. The self-realized
soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth.” Un-
less one is tattva-darsi, in complete knowledge of the Absolute Truth,
one cannot describe the activities of the Personality of Godhead.
Therefore although there are many so-called Ramayanas, or histories of
Lord Ramacandra’s activities, some of them are not actually authorita-
tive. Sometimes Lord Ramacandra’s activities are described in terms of
one’s own imaginations, speculations or material sentiments. But the
characteristics of Lord Ramacandra should not be handled as something
imaginary. While describing the history of Lord Ramacandra, Sukadeva
Gosvami told Maharaja Pariksit, “You have already heard about the ac-
tivities of Lord Ramacandra.” Apparently, therefore, five thousand years
ago there were many Ramayanas, or histories of Lord Ramacandra’s ac-
tivities, and there are many still. But we must select only those books


--- Page 59 ---
52 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 10
written by tattva-darsis (jiianinas tattva-darsinah), not the books of so-
called scholars who claim knowledge only on the basis of a doctorate.
This is a warning by Sukadeva Gosvami. Rsibhis tattva-darsibhih. Al-
though the Ramayana composed by Valmiki is a huge literature, the
same activities are summarized here by Sukadeva Gosvami in a few
verses.

TRANSLATION
To keep the promise of His father intact, Lord Ramacandra im-
mediately gave up the position of king and, accompanied by His
wife, mother Sita, wandered from one forest to another on His
lotus feet, which were so delicate that they were unable to bear
even the touch of Sita’s palms. The Lord was also accompanied by
Hanuman [or by another monkey, Sugrival, king of the monkeys,
and by His own younger brother Lord Laksmana, both of whom
gave Him relief from the fatigue of wandering in the forest. Hav-
ing cut off the nose and ears of Surpanakha, thus disfiguring her,
the Lord was separated from mother Sita. He therefore became
angry, moving His eyebrows and thus frightening the ocean, who
then allowed the Lord to construct a bridge to cross the ocean.
Subsequently, the Lord entered the kingdom of Ravana to kill
him, like a fire devouring a forest. May that Supreme Lord, Rama-
candra, give us all protection.

TRANSLATION

O King, the pastimes of Lord Ramacandra were wonderful, like
those of a baby elephant. In the assembly where mother Sita was to
choose her husband, in the midst of the heroes of this world, He
broke the bow belonging to Lord Siva. This bow was so heavy that
it was carried by three hundred men, but Lord Ramacandra bent
and strung it and broke it in the middle, just as a baby elephant
breaks a stick of sugarcane. Thus the Lord achieved the hand of
mother Sita, who was equally as endowed with transcendental
qualities of form, beauty, behavior, age and nature. Indeed, she
was the goddess of fortune who constantly rests on the chest of the
Lord. While returning from Sita’s home after gaining her at the
assembly of competitors, Lord Ramacandra met ParaSurama. Al-
though Parasurama was very proud, having rid the earth of the
royal order twenty-one times, he was defeated by the Lord, who
appeared to be a ksatriya of the royal order.

Carrying out the order of His father, who was bound by a prom-
ise to his wife, Lord Ramacandra left behind His kingdom, opu-
lence, friends, well-wishers, residence and everything else, just as
a liberated soul gives up his life, and went to the forest with Sita.

PURPORT

Maharaja Dasaratha had three wives. One of them, Kaikeyi, served
him very pleasingly, and he therefore wanted to give her a benediction.
Kaikeyi, however, said that she would ask for the benediction when it
was necessary. At the time of the coronation of Prince Ramacandra,
Kaikeyl requested her husband to enthrone her son Bharata and send
Ramacandra to the forest. Maharaja Dasaratha, being bound by his prom-
ise, ordered Ramacandra to go to the forest, according to the dictation of
his beloved. And the Lord, as an obedient son, accepted the order im-
mediately. He left everything without hesitation, just as a liberated soul
or great yogi gives up his life without material attraction.

Sita, his mind was agitated by lusty desires, and he went to kidnap
her. To distract Lord Ramacandra from His arama, Ravana sent
Marica in the form of a golden deer, and when Lord Ramacandra
saw that wonderful deer, He left His residence and followed it and
finally killed it with a sharp arrow, just as Lord Siva killed Daksa.

Text 11] The Pastimes of Lord Ramacandra 59

raksah-adhamena—by the most wicked among Raksasas, Ravana;
vrka-vat—like a tiger; vipine—in the forest; asamaksam—unprotected;
vaideha-raja-duhitari—by this condition of mother Sita, the daugh-
ter of the King of Videha; apayapitayam—having been kidnapped;
bhratra—with His brother; vane—in the forest; krpana-vat—as if a
very distressed person; priyaya—by his dear wife; viyuktah—sepa-
rated; stri-sariginam—of persons attracted to or connected with women;
gatim—destination;  iti—thus; prathayan—giving an example;
cacara—wandered.

TRANSLATION

‘When Ramacandra entered the forest and Laksmana was also ab-
sent, the worst of the Raksasas, Ravana, kidnapped Sitadevi, the
daughter of the King of Videha, just as a tiger seizes unprotected
sheep when the shepherd is absent. Then Lord Ramacandra wan-
dered in the forest with His brother Laksmana as if very much dis-
tressed due to separation from His wife. Thus He showed by His
personal example the condition of a person attached to women.

PURPORT

In this verse the words stri-sanginari gatim iti indicate that the condi-
tion of a person attached to women was shown by the Lord Himself. Ac-
cording to moral instructions, grhe narim vivarjayet: when one goes on a
tour, one should not bring his wife. Formerly men used to travel without
conveyances, but still, as far as possible, when one leaves home one
should not take his wife with him, especially if one is in such a condition
as Lord Ramacandra when banished by the order of His father. Whether
in the forest or at home, if one is attached to women this attachment is al-
ways troublesome, as shown by the Supreme Personality of Godhead by
His personal example.

Of course, this is the material side of stri-sargi, but the situation of
Lord Ramacandra is spiritual, for He does not belong to the material
world. Narayanah paro ’vyaktat: Narayana is beyond the material cre-
ation. Because He is the creator of the material world, He is not subject to
the conditions of the material world. The separation of Lord Ramacandra
from Sita is spiritually understood as vipralambha, which is an activity
of the hladini potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead belonging


--- Page 67 ---
60 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 10
to the srngara-rasa, the mellow of conjugal love in the spiritual world. In
the spiritual world the Supreme Personality of Godhead has all the deal-
ings of love, displaying the symptoms called sattvika, sasicari, vilapa,
miircchd and unmada. Thus when Lord Ramacandra was separated from
Sita, all these spiritual symptoms were manifested. The Lord is neither
impersonal nor impotent. Rather, He is sac-cid-ananda-vigraha, the
eternal form of knowledge and bliss. Thus He has all the symptoms of
spiritual bliss. Feeling separation from one’s beloved is also an item of
spiritual bliss. As explained by Srila Svaripa Damodara Gosvami, radha-
krsna-pranaya-vikrtir hladini-Saktih: the dealings of love between
Radha and Krsna are displayed as the pleasure potency of the Lord. The
Lord is the original source of all pleasure, the reservoir of all pleasure.
Lord Ramacandra, therefore, manifested the truth both spiritually and
materially. Materially those who are attached to women suffer, but spiri-
tually when there are feelings of separation between the Lord and His
pleasure potency the spiritual bliss of the Lord increases. This is further
explained in Bhagavad-gita (9.11):
avajananti mar midha
manusim tanum asritam
param bhavam ajananto
mama bhita-mahesvaram
One who does not know the spiritual potency of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead thinks of the Lord as an ordinary human being. But the
Lord’s mind, intelligence and senses can never be affected by material
conditions. This fact is further explained in the Skanda Purana, as
quoted by Madhvacarya:
nitya-pirna-sukha-jiiana-
svaritpo ’sau yato vibhuh
ato ’sya rama ity akhya
tasya duhkhari kuto nv api

It was actually impossible for Ravana to take away Sita. The form of Sita
taken by Ravana was an illusory representation of mother Sita —maya-
sita. When Sita was tested in the fire, this maya-sita was burnt, and the
real Sita came out of the fire.

A further understanding to be derived from this example is that a
woman, however powerful she may be in the material world, must be
given protection, for as soon as she is unprotected she will be exploited
by Raksasas like Ravana. Here the words vaideha-raja-duhitari indicate
that before mother Sita was married to Lord Ramacandra she was pro-
tected by her father, Vaideha-raja. And when she was married she was
protected by her husband. Therefore the conclusion is that a woman
should always be protected. According to the Vedic rule, there is no scope
for a woman’s being independent (asamaksam), for a woman cannot
protect herself independently.

TRANSLATION
Lord Ramacandra, whose lotus feet are worshiped by Lord
Brahma and Lord Siva, had assumed the form of a human being.
Thus He performed the funeral ceremony of Jatayu, who was
killed by Ravana. The Lord then killed the demon named
Kabandha, and after making friends with the monkey chiefs, kill-
ing Vali and arranging for the deliverance of mother Sita, He went
to the beach of the ocean.
PURPORT
When Ravana kidnapped Sita, he was obstructed on the way by Jatayu,
a large bird. But the powerful Ravana defeated Jatayu in the fight and
cut his wing. When Ramacandra was searching for Sita, He found Jatayu
almost dead and was informed that Sita has been carried off by Ravana.
When Jatayu died, Lord Ramacandra did the duty of a son by performing
the funeral ceremony, and then He made friends with the monkeys to
deliver Sitadevi.

simply by His glancing over the ocean, all the living entities within
it, including the crocodiles and sharks, were agitated by fear. Then
the personified ocean fearfully approached Lord Ramacandra, tak-
ing all paraphernalia to worship Him. Falling at the Lord’s lotus
feet, the personified ocean spoke as follows.

O all-pervading Supreme Person, we are dull-minded and did

the Supreme Person, the master of the entire universe, the
unchanging and original Personality of Godhead. The demigods
are infatuated with the mode of goodness, the Prajapatis with the
mode of passion, and the lord of ghosts with the mode of ig-
norance, but You are the master of all these qualities.

PURPORT

The word jada-dhiyah refers to intelligence like that of an animal. A
person with such intelligence cannot understand the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead. Without being beaten, an animal cannot understand
the purpose of a man. Similarly, those who are dull-minded cannot
understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but when punished
severely by the modes of material nature, they begin to understand Him.
A Hindi poet has said:

duhkha se saba hari bhaje
sukha se bhaje kot


--- Page 72 ---
Text 15] The Pastimes of Lord Ramacandra 65
sukha se agar hari bhaje
duhkha kathan se haya
When one is distressed he goes to the church or temple to worship the
Lord, but when opulent he forgets the Lord. Therefore, punishment by
the Lord through material nature is necessary in human society, for
without it men forget the supremacy of the Lord due to their dull, blunt
intelligence.

66 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 10
regain Your wife, Sitadevi. O great hero, although my water pre-
sents no impediment to Your going to Lanka, please construct a
bridge over it to spread Your transcendental fame. Upon seeing
this wonderfully uncommon deed of Your Lordship, all the great
heroes and kings in the future will glorify You.

PURPORT

It is said that a son and urine emanate from the same source—the
genitals. When a son is a devotee or a great learned person, the seminal
discharge for begetting a son is successful, but if the son is unqualified
and brings no glory to his family, he is no better than urine. Here Ravana
is compared to urine because he was a cause of disturbances to the
three worlds. Thus the ocean personified wanted him killed by Lord
Ramacandra.

One feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord Ramacandra
is omnipotence. The Lord can act without regard to material impedi-
ments or inconveniences, but to prove that He is the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead and was not merely advertised as Godhead or elected
by popular vote, He constructed a wonderful bridge over the ocean.
Nowadays it has become fashionable to create some artificial God who
performs no uncommon activities; a little magic will bewilder a foolish
person into selecting an artificial God because he does not understand
how powerful God is. Lord Ramacandra, however, constructed a bridge
over the water with stone by making the stone float. This is proof of
God’s uncommonly wonderful power. Why should someone be accepted
as God without displaying extraordinary potency by doing something
never to be done by any common man? We accept Lord Ramacandra as
the Supreme Personality of Godhead because He constructed this bridge,
and we accept Lord Krsna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead be-
cause He lifted Govardhana Hill when He was only seven years old. We
should not accept any rascal as God or an incarnation of God, for God dis-
plays special features in His various activities. Therefore, the Lord Him-
self says in Bhagavad-gita (4.9):

Jjanma karma ca me divyam
evar yo vetti tattvatah

“One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and ac-
tivities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this ma-
terial world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.” The activities of
the Lord are not common; they are all transcendentally wonderful and
not able to be performed by any other living being. The symptoms of the
Lord’s activities are all mentioned in the $astras, and after one under-
stands them one can accept the Lord as He is.

trees and other vegetation had been shaken by the hands of great
monkeys, Lord Ramacandra went to Lanka to release Sitadevi from
the clutches of Ravana. With the direction and help of Vibhisana,
Ravana’s brother, the Lord, along with the monkey soldiers,
headed by Sugriva, Nila and Hanuman, entered Ravana’s kingdom,
Lanka, which had previously been burnt by Hanuman.
PURPORT
Great mountain peaks covered with trees and plants were thrown into
the sea by the monkey soldiers and began to float by the supreme will of
the Lord. By the supreme will of the Lord, many great planets float
weightlessly in space like swabs of cotton. If this is possible, why should
great mountain peaks not be able to float on water ? This is the omnipo-
tence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He can do anything and
everything He likes, because He is not under the control of the material
nature; indeed, material nature is controlled by Him. Mayadhyaksena
prakrtih siyate sacaracaram: only under His direction does prakrti, or
material nature, work. Similar information is given in the Brahma-
samhita (5.52):
yasyajiiaya bhramati sambhrta-kala-cakro
govindam adi-purusam tam ahar bhajami
Describing how material nature works, the Brahma-sarhita says that
the sun moves as desired by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Conse-
quently, for Lord Ramacandra to construct a bridge over the Indian
Ocean with the help of monkey soldiers who threw great mountain peaks
into the water is not at all wonderful; it is wonderful only in the sense
that it has kept the name and fame of Lord Ramacandra eternally
celebrated.

TRANSLATION
Angada and the other commanders of the soldiers of
Ramacandra faced the elephants, infantry, horses and chariots of
the enemy and hurled against them big trees, mountain peaks,
clubs and arrows. Thus the soldiers of Lord Ramacandra killed
Ravana’s soldiers, who had lost all good fortune because Ravana
had been condemned by the anger of mother Sita.
PURPORT
The soldiers Lord Ramacandra recruited in the jungle were all
monkeys and did not have proper equipment with which to fight the
soldiers of Ravana, for Ravana’s soldiers were equipped with weapons of
modern warfare whereas the monkeys could only throw stones, mountain
peaks and trees. It was only Lord Ramacandra and Laksmana who shot
some arrows. But because the soldiers of Ravana were condemned by the
curse of mother Sita, the monkeys were able to kill them simply by
throwing stones and trees. There are two kinds of strength —daiva and
purusakara. Daiva refers to the strength achieved from the Transcen-
dence, and purusakara refers to the strength organized by one’s own in-
telligence and power. Transcendental power is always superior to the
power of the materialist. Depending on the mercy of the Supreme Lord,
one must fight one’s enemies even though one may not be equipped with
modern weapons. Therefore Krsna instructed Arjuna, mam anusmara
yudhya ca: “Think of Me and fight.” We should fight our enemy to the
best of our ability, but for victory we must depend on the mercy of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Thereafter, when Ravana, the King of the Raksasas, observed
that his soldiers had been lost, he was extremely angry. Thus he
mounted his airplane, which was decorated with flowers, and pro-
ceeded toward Lord Ramacandra, who sat on the effulgent chariot
brought by Matali, the chariot driver of Indra. Then Ravana struck
Lord Ramacandra with sharp arrows.

TRANSLATION

Lord Ramacandra said to Ravana: You are the most abominable
of the man-eaters. Indeed, you are like their stool. You resemble a
dog, for as a dog steals eatables from the kitchen in the absence of
the householder, in My absence you kidnapped My wife, Sitadevi.
Therefore as Yamaraja punishes sinful men, I shall also punish
you. You are most abominable, sinful and shameless. Today,
therefore, I, whose attempt never fails, shall punish you.

PURPORT

Na ca daivat param balam: no one can surpass the strengh of the
Transcendence. Ravana was so sinful and shameless that he did not know
what the result would be of kidnapping mother Sita, the pleasure potency
of Ramacandra. This is the disqualification of the Raksasas. Asatyam
apratistham te jagad ahur anisvaram. The Raksasas are unaware that the
Supreme Lord is the ruler of the creation. They think that everything
has come about by chance or accident and that there is no ruler, king or
controller. Therefore the Raksasas act independently, as they like, going
even so far as to kidnap the goddess of fortune. This policy of Ravana’s is
extremely dangerous for the materialist; indeed, it brings ruin to the
materialistic civilization. Nonetheless, because atheists are Raksasas,
they dare to do things that are most abominable, and thus they are
punished without fail. Religion consists of the orders of the Supreme
Lord, and one who carries out these orders is religious. One who fails to
carry out the Lord’s orders is irreligious, and he is to be punished.

TRANSLATION
After thus rebuking Ravana, Lord Ramacandra fixed an arrow to
His bow, aimed at Ravana, and released the arrow, which pierced
Ravana’s heart like a thunderbolt. Upon seeing this, Ravana’s
followers raised a tumultuous sound, crying, “Alas! Alas! What
has happened? What has happened ?”’ as Ravana, vomiting blood
from his ten mouths, fell from his airplane, just as a pious man
falls to earth from the heavenly planets when the results of his
pious activities are exhausted.
PURPORT
In Bhagavad-gita (9.21) it is said, ksine punye martya-lokari visanti:
“When the results of their pious activities are exhausted, those who have


--- Page 83 ---
76 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 10
enjoyed in the heavenly planets fall again to earth.” The fruitive ac-
tivities of this material world are such that whether one acts piously or
impiously one must remain within the material world according to dif-
ferent conditions, for neither pious nor impious actions can relieve one
from maya’s clutches of repeated birth and death. Somehow or other,
Ravana was raised to an exalted position as the king of a great kingdom
with all material opulences, but because of his sinful act of kidnapping
mother Sita, all the results of his pious activities were destroyed. If one
offends an exalted personality, especially the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, one certainly becomes most abominable; bereft of the results
of pious activities, one must fall down like Ravana and other demons. It
is therefore advised that one transcend both pious and impious activities
and remain in the pure state of freedom from all designations
(sarvopadhi-vinirmuktam tat-paratvena nirmalam). When one is fixed
in devotional service, he is above the material platform. On the material
platform there are higher and lower positions, but when one is above the
material platform he is always fixed in a spiritual position (sa gunan
samatityaitan brahma-bhityaya kalpate). Ravana or those like him may
be very powerful and opulent in this material world, but theirs is not a
secure position, because, after all, they are bound by the results of their
karma (karmana daiva-netrena). We should not forget that we are com-
pletely dependent on the laws of nature.
prakrteh kriyamanani
gunaih karmani sarvasah

“The bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of
material nature, thinks himself the doer of activities that are in actuality
carried out by nature.” (Bg. 3.27) One should not be proud of one’s ex-
alted position and act like Ravana, thinking oneself independent of
material nature’s laws.

has been conquered by the enemy. To whom will it go for shelter?
PURPORT
Ravana’s wife Mandodari and the other wives knew very well how
cruel a person Ravana was. The very word “Ravana” means “one who
causes crying for others.” Ravapa continuously caused trouble for
others, but when his sinful activities culminated in giving trouble to
Sitadevi, he was killed by Lord Ramacandra.

desires; gatah—having become; tejah—by influence; anubhavam—as a

TRANSLATION
O greatly fortunate one, you came under the influence of lusty
desires, and therefore you could not understand the influence of
mother Sita. Now, because of her curse, you have been reduced to
this state, having been killed by Lord Ramacandra.
PURPORT
Not only was mother Sita powerful, but any woman who follows in the
footsteps of mother Sita can also become similarly powerful. There are
many instances of this in the history of Vedic literature. Whenever we
find a description of ideal chaste women, mother Sita is among them.
Mandodari, the wife of Ravana, was also very chaste. Similarly, Draupadi
was one of five exalted chaste women. As a man must follow great per-
sonalities like Brahma and Narada, a woman must follow the path of
such ideal women as Sita, Mandodari and Draupadi. By staying chaste
and faithful to her husband, a woman enriches herself with supernatural
power. It is a moral principle that one should not be influenced by lusty
desires for another’s wife. Matrvat para-daresu: an intelligent person
must look upon another’s wife as being like his mother. This is a moral
injunction from Canakya-$loka (10).
matrvat para-daresu
para-dravyesu lostravat
atmavat sarva-bhiitesu

--- Page 87 ---

“One who considers another’s wife as his mother, another’s possessions
as a lump of dirt and treats all other living beings as he would himself, is
considered to be learned.” Thus Ravana was condemned not only by
Lord Ramacandra but even by his own wife, Mandodari. Because she was
a chaste woman, she knew the power of another chaste woman, especially
such a wife as mother Sitadevi.

O pleasure of the Raksasa dynasty, because of you the state of

you have made your body fit to be eaten by vultures and your soul
fit to go to hell.
PURPORT
One who follows the path of Ravana is condemned in two ways: his
body is fit to be eaten by dogs and vultures, and the soul goes to hell. As
stated by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gita (16.19):
tan aha dvisatah kraran

Text 29] The Pastimes of Lord Ramacandra 81
“Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among
men, are cast by Me into the ocean of material existence, into various
demoniac species of life.” Thus the destination of godless atheists such as
Ravana, Hiranyakadipu, Kammsa and Dantavakra is a hellish condition of
life. Mandodari, the wife of Ravana, could understand all this because
she was a chaste woman. Although lamenting for the death of her hus-
band, she knew what would happen to his body and soul, for although
one cannot see directly with one’s material eyes, one can see with eyes of
knowledge (pasyanti jiana-caksusah). In Vedic history there are many
instances of how one becomes godless and is condemned by the laws of
nature.

Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said: Vihhisana, the pious brother of
Ravana and devotee of Lord Ramacandra, received approval from
Lord Ramacandra, the King of Kosala. Then he performed the


--- Page 89 ---
82 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 10
prescribed funeral ceremonies for his family members to save
them from the path to hell.
PURPORT

After giving up the body, one is transferred to another body, but
sometimes, if one is too sinful, he is checked from transmigrating to
another body, and thus he becomes a ghost. To save a diseased person
from ghostly life, the funeral ceremony, or sraddha ceremony, as
prescribed in authorized $astra, must be performed. Ravana was killed
by Lord Ramacandra and was destined for hellish life, but by Lord
Ramacandra’s advice, Vibhisana, Ravana’s brother, performed all the
duties prescribed in relation to the dead. Thus Lord Rimacandra was
kind to Ravana even after Ravana’s death.

Thereafter, Lord Ramacandra found Sitadevi sitting in a small

She was lean and thin, being aggrieved because of separation from
Him.

When Lord Bharata understood that Lord Ramacandra was
returning to the capital, Ayodhya, He immediately took upon His
own head Lord Ramacandra’s wooden shoes and came out from
His camp at Nandigrama. Lord Bharata was accompanied by
ministers, priests and other respectable citizens, by professional
musicians vibrating pleasing musical sounds, and by learned
brahmanas loudly chanting Vedic hymns. Following in the proces-
sion were chariots drawn by beautiful horses with harnesses of
golden rope. These chariots were decorated by flags with golden
embroidery and by other flags of various sizes and patterns. There
were soldiers bedecked with golden armor, servants bearing betel
nut, and many well-known and beautiful prostitutes. Many ser-
vants followed on foot, bearing an umbrella, whisks, different
grades of precious jewels, and other paraphernalia befitting a royal
reception. Accompanied in this way, Lord Bharata, His heart
softened in ecstasy and His eyes full of tears, approached Lord
Ramacandra and fell at His lotus feet with great ecstatic love.

family, and all the citizens of Ayodhya offered their respectful
obeisances unto the Lord.

Text 50] The Pastimes of Lord Ramacandra 95
He cared for the citizens exactly like a father, and the citizens,
being fully engaged in their occupational duties of varna and
asrama, accepted Him as their father.
PURPORT

People are very fond of the pattern of Rima-rajya, and even today
politicians sometimes form a party called Rima-rajya, but unfortunately
they have no obedience to Lord Rama. It is sometimes said that people
want the kingdom of God without God. Such an aspiration, however, is
never to be fulfilled. Good government can exist when the relationship
between the citizens and the government is like that exemplified by Lord
Ramacandra and His citizens. Lord Ramacandra ruled His kingdom ex-
actly as a father takes care of his children, and the citizens, being obliged
to the good government of Lord Ramacandra, accepted the Lord as their
father. Thus the relationship between the citizens and the government
should be exactly like that between father and son. When the sons in a
family are well trained, they are obedient to the father and mother, and
when the father is well qualified, he takes good care of the children. As
indicated here by the words sva-dharma-nirata varnasrama-gunan-
vitah, the people were good citizens because they accepted the institution
of varna and asrama, which arranges society in the varna divisions of
brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya and Sidra and the asrama divisions of
brahmacarya, grhastha, vdnaprastha and sanmyasa. This is actual
human civilization. People must be trained according to the different
varndsrama occupational duties. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (4.13),
catur-varnyyarm maya srstar guna-karma-vibhagasah: the four varnas
must be established according to varying qualities and work. The first
principle for good government is that it must institute this varndsrama
system. The purpose of varnasrama is to enable people to become God
conscious. Varnasramdcaravata purusena parah puman  visnur
aradhyate. The entire varnasrama scheme is intended to enable people
to become Vaisnavas. Visnur asya devata. When people worship Lord
Visnu as the Supreme Lord, they become Vaisnavas. Thus people should
be trained to become Vaisnavas through the system of varna and asrama,
as they were during the reign of Lord Ramacandra, when everyone was
fully trained to follow the varnasrama principles.


--- Page 103 ---
96 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 10

Simply enforcing laws and ordinances cannot make the citizens obe-
dient and lawful. That is impossible. Throughout the entire world there
are so many states, legislative assemblies and parliaments, but still the
citizens are rogues and thieves. Good citizenship, therefore, cannot be
enforced; the citizens must be trained. As there are schools and colleges
to train students to become chemical engineers, lawyers or specialists in
many other departments of knowledge, there must be schools and col-
leges to train students to become brahmanas, ksatriyas, vaiSyas, $udras,
brahmacaris, grhasthas, vanaprasthas and sannydasis. This will provide
the preliminary condition for good citizenship (varnasrama-gunan-
woh). Generally speaking, if the king or president is a rajarsi, the rela-
tionship between the citizens and the chief executive will be clear, and
there will be no possibility of disruption in the state, because the number
of thieves and rogues will decrease. In Kali-yuga, however, because the
varndsrama system is neglected, people are generally thieves and rogues.
In the system of democracy, such thieves and rogues naturally collect
money from other thieves and rogues, and thus there is chaos in every
government, and no one is happy. But here the example of good govern-
ment 15 to be found in the reign of Lord Rimacandra. If people follow
this example, there will be good government all over the world.

TRANSLATION

Lord Ramacandra became King during Treta-yuga, but because
of His good government, the age was like Satya-yuga. Everyone
was religious and completely happy.

PURPORT

Among the four yugas—Satya, Tretia, Dvapara and Kali—the Kali-
yuga is the worst, but if the process of varnasrama-dharma is in-
troduced, even in this age of Kali, the situation of Satya-yuga can be
invoked. The Hare Krsna movement, or Krsna consciousness movement,
is meant for this purpose.

kaler dosa-nidhe rajann
asti hy 6100 mahan gunah

“My dear King, although Kali-yuga is full of faults, there is still one
good quality about this age: simply by chanting the Hare Krsna maha-
mantra, one can become free from material bondage and be promoted to
the transcendental kingdom.” (Bhag. 12.3.51) If people take to this
sarkirtana movement of chanting Hare Krsna, Hare Rama, they will cer-
tainly be freed from the contamination of Kali-yuga, and the people of
this age will be happy, as people were in Satya-yuga, the golden age.
Anyone, anywhere, can easily take to this Hare Krsna movement; one
need only chant the Hare Krsna maha-mantra, observe the rules and
regulations, and stay free from the contamination of sinful life. Even if
one is sinful and cannot give up sinful life immediately, if he chants the
Hare Krsna maha-mantra with devotion and faith he will certainly be
freed from all sinful activities, and his life will be successful. Parari
vijayate $ri-krsna-sarnkirtanam. This is the blessing of Lord Ramacandra,
who has appeared in this age of Kali as Lord Gaurasundara.

‘When Lord Ramacandra, the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
was the King of this world, all bodily and mental suffering, dis-
ease, old age, bereavement, lamentation, distress, fear and fatigue
were completely absent. There was even no death for those who
did not want it.
PURPORT
All these facilities existed because of Lord Ramacandra’s presence as
the King of the entire world. A similar situation could be introduced im-
mediately, even in this age called Kali, the worst of all ages. It is said,
kali-kale nama-ripe krsna-avatara: Krsna descends in this Kali-yuga in
the form of His holy name— Hare Krsna, Hare Rima. If we chant
offenselessly, Rama and Krsna are still present in this age. The kingdom
of Rama was immensely popular and beneficial, and the spreading of this
Hare Krsna movement can immediately introduce a similar situation,
even in this Kali-yuga.

Lord Ramacandra took a vow to accept only one wife and have

--- Page 107 ---

everything in His character was good, untinged by qualities like
anger. He taught good behavior for everyone, especially for
householders, in terms of varnasrama-dharma. Thus He taught the
general public by His personal activities.
PURPORT
Eka-patni-vrata, accepting only one wife, was the glorious example set
by Lord Ramacandra. One should not accept more than one wife. In those
days, of course, people did marry more than one wife. Even Lord
Ramacandra’s father accepted more wives than one. But Lord Rama-
candra, as an ideal king, accepted only one wife, mother Sita. When
mother Sita was kidnapped by Ravana and the Raksasas, Lord Rama-
candra, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, could have married
hundreds and thousands of Sitas, but to teach us how faithful He was to
His wife, He fought with Ravana and finally killed him. The Lord
punished Ravana and rescued His wife to instruct men to have only one
wife. Lord Ramacandra accepted only one wife and manifested sublime
character, thus setting an example for householders. A householder
should live according to the ideal of Lord Ramacandra, who showed how
to be a perfect person. Being a householder or living with a wife and
children is never condemned, provided one lives according to the regula-
tive principles of varnasrama-dharma. Those who live in accordance
with these principles, whether as householders, brahmacaris or
vanaprasthas, are all equally important.

TRANSLATION

Mother Sita was very submissive, faithful, shy and chaste, always
understanding the attitude of her husband. Thus by her character
and her love and service she completely attracted the mind of the
Lord.

PURPORT

As Lord Ramacandra is the ideal husband (eka-patni-vrata), mother
Sita is the ideal wife. Such a combination makes family life very happy.
Yad yad acarati sresthas tat tad evetaro janah: whatever example a great
man sets, common people follow. If the kings, the leaders, and the
brahmanas, the teachers, would set forth the examples we receive from
Vedic literature, the entire world would be heaven; indeed, there would
no longer be hellish conditions within this material world.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Tenth
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhiagavatam, entitled “The Pastimes of the
Supreme Lord, Ramacandra.”


--- Page 109 ---
CHAPTER ELEVEN
Lord Rimacandra Rules the World
This chapter describes how Lord Ramacandra resided in Ayodhya with
His younger brothers and performed various sacrifices.

Lord Ramacandra, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, performed
various sacrifices by which to worship Himself, and at the end of these
sacrifices He gave land to the hotd, adhvaryu, udgata and brahma
priests. He gave them the eastern, western, northern and southern direc-
tions respectively, and the balance He gave to the acarya. Lord
Riamacandra’s faith in the brahmanas and affection for His servants was
observed by all the brahmanas, who then offered their prayers to the
Lord and returned whatever they had taken from Him. They regarded
the enlightenment given to them by the Lord within the core of their
hearts as a sufficient contribution. Lord Ramacandra subsequently
dressed Himself like an ordinary person and began wandering within the
capital to understand what impression the citizens had of Him. By
chance, one night He heard a man talking to his wife, who had gone to
another man’s house. In the course of rebuking his wife, the man spoke
suspiciously of the character of Sitadevi. The Lord immediately returned
home, and, fearing such rumors, He superficially decided to give up
Sitadevi’s company. Thus He banished Sitadevi, who was pregnant, to
the shelter of Valmiki Muni, where she gave birth to twin sons, named
Lava and Kuéa. In Ayodhya, Laksmana begot two sons named Angada
and Citraketu, Bharata begot two sons named _Taksa and Puskala, and
Satrughna begot two sons named Subihu and Srutasena. When Bharata
went out to conquer various lands on behalf of the emperor, Lord Rima-
candra, He fought many millions of Gandharvas. By killing them in the
fight, He acquired immense wealth, which He then brought home.
Satrughna killed a demon named Lavapa at Madhuvana and thus
established the capital of Mathura. Meanwhile, Sitadevi placed her two
sons in the care of Valmiki Muni and then entered into the earth. Upon
hearing of this, Lord Ramacandra was very much aggrieved, and thus He
performed sacrifices for thirteen thousand years. After describing the

103


--- Page 110 ---
104 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 11
pastimes of Lord Rimacandra’s disappearance and establishing that the
Lord appears for His pastimes only, Sukadeva Gosvami ends this chapter
by describing the results of hearing about the activities of Lord Rama-
candra and by describing how the Lord protected His citizens and dis-
played affection for His brothers.

yatha taror mila-nisecanena

trpyanti tat-skandha-bhujopasakhah
pranopaharac ca yathendriyanari
tathaiva sarvarhanam acyutejya
“As pouring water on the root of a tree nourishes the trunk, branches,
twigs and leaves, and as supplying food to the stomach enlivens the
senses and limbs of the body, worshiping the Supreme Personality of
Godhead satisfies the demigods, who are part of that Supreme Per-
sonality.” Performing yajia involves worshiping the Supreme Lord.
Here the Supreme Lord worshiped the Supreme Lord. Therefore it is
said, bhagavan atmanatmanam ije: the Lord worshiped Himself by
Himself. This does not, of course, justify the Mayavada philosophy, by
which one thinks himself the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The jiva,
the living entity, is always different from the Supreme Lord. The living
entities (vibhinnarsa) never become one with the Lord, although
Mayavadis sometimes imitate the Lord’s worship of Himself. Lord Krsna
meditated upon Himself every morning as a grhastha, and similarly Lord
Ramacandra performed yajiias to satisfy Himself, but this does not mean
that an ordinary living being should imitate the Lord by accepting the
process of ahangraha-updasana. Such unauthorized worship is not
recommended herein.

and the north to the udgata priest, the reciter of the Sama Veda. In
this way, He donated His kingdom.

TRANSLATION
All the brahmanas who were engaged in the various activities of
the sacrifice were very pleased with Lord Ramacandra, who was


--- Page 114 ---
108 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 11
greatly affectionate and favorable to the brahmanas. Thus with
melted hearts they returned all the property received from Him
and spoke as follows.
PURPORT

In the previous chapter it was said that the prajas, the citizens, strictly
followed the system of varmasrama-dharma. The brahmanas acted ex-
actly like brahmanas, the ksatriyas exactly like ksatriyas, and so on.
Therefore, when Lord Ramacandra gave everything in charity to the
brahmanas, the brahmanas, being qualified, wisely considered that
brahmanas are not meant to possess property to make a profit from it.
The qualifications of a brakmana are given in Bhagavad-gita (18.42):

Samo damas tapah Saucarn
ksantir arjavam eva ca
JAdnam vijiidnam dastikyam
brahma-karma svabhavajam

“Peacefulness, self-control, austerity, purity, tolerance, honesty,
wisdom, knowledge, and religiousness —these are the qualities by which
the brahmanas work.” The brahminical character offers no scope for
possessing land and ruling citizens; these are the duties of a ksatriya.
Therefore, although the brahmanas did not refuse Lord Ramacandra’s
gift, after accepting it they returned it to the King. The brahmanas were
so pleased with Lord Ramacandra’s affection toward them that their
hearts melted. They saw that Lord Ramacandra, aside from being the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, was fully qualified as a ksatriya and
was exemplary in character. One of the qualifications of a ksatriya is to
be charitable. A ksatriya, or ruler, levies taxes upon the citizens not for
his personal sense gratification but to give charity in suitable cases.
Danam iSvara-bhavah. On one hand, ksatriyas have the propensity to
rule, but on the other they are very liberal with charity. When Maharaja
Yudhisthira gave charity, he engaged Karna to take charge of distribut-
ing it. Karna was very famous as Data Karna. The word data refers to
one who gives charity very liberally. The kings always kept a large quan-
tity of food grains in stock, and whenever there was any scarcity of


--- Page 115 ---
Text 6] Lord Ramacandra Rules the World 109
grains, they would distribute grains in charity. A ksatriya’s duty is to
give charity, and a brahmana’s duty is to accept charity, but not more
than needed to maintain body and soul together. Therefore, when the
brahmanas were given so much land by Lord Ramacandra, they returned
it to Him and were not greedy.

O Lord, You are the master of the entire universe. What have
You not given to us? You have entered the core of our hearts and
dissipated the darkness of our ignorance by Your effulgence. This
is the supreme gift. We do not need a material donation.

PURPORT

When Dhruva Maharaja was offered a benediction by the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, he replied, “0 my Lord, I am fully satisfied. I do
not need any material benediction.” Similarly, when Prahlada Maharaja
was offered a benediction by Lord Nrsirhhadeva, he also refused to accept
it and instead declared that a devotee should not be like a vanik, a mer-
cantile man who gives something in exchange for some profit. One who
becomes a devotee for some material profit is not a pure devotee.


--- Page 116 ---
110 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 11
Brahmanas are always enlightened by the Supreme Personality of God-
head within the heart (sarvasya caham hrdi sannivisto mattah smrtir
jiianam apohanari ca). And because the brahmanas and Vaisnavas are
always directed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they are not
greedy for material wealth. What is absolutely necessary they possess,
but they do not want an expanded kingdom. An example of this was
given by Vamanadeva. Acting as a brahmacari, Lord Vamanadeva
wanted only three paces of land. Aspiring to possess more and more for
personal sense gratification is simply ignorance, and this ignorance is
conspicuous by its absence from the heart of a brahmana or Vaisnava.

After hearing the news of mother Sita’s entering the earth, the
Supreme Personality of Godhead was certainly aggrieved. Al-

bering the exalted qualities of mother Sita, He could not check His
grief in transcendental love.
PURPORT
Lord Ramacandra’s grief at the news of Sitadevi’s entering the earth is
not to be considered material. In the spiritual world also there are feel-
ings of separation, but such feelings are considered spiritual bliss. Grief
in separation exists even in the Absolute, but such feelings of separation
in the spiritual world are transcendentally blissful. Such feelings are a
sign of tasya prema-vaSyatva-svabhava, being under the influence of
hladini-Sakti and being controlled by love. In the material world such
feelings of separation are only a perverted reflection.

The attraction between man and woman, or male and female, al-
ways exists everywhere, making everyone always fearful. Such
feelings are present even among the controllers like Brahma and
Lord Siva and is the cause of fear for them, what to speak of others
who are attached to household life in this material world.
PURPORT
As explained above, when the feelings of love and transcendental bliss
from the spiritual world are pervertedly reflected in this material world,
they are certainly the cause of bondage. As long as men feel attracted to
women in this material world and women feel attracted to men, the
bondage of repeated birth and death will continue. But in the spiritual
world, where there is no fear of birth and death, such feelings of separa-
tion are the cause of transcendental bliss. In the absolute reality there are
varieties of feeling, but all of them are of the same quality of
transcendental bliss.

TRANSLATION
After completing the sacrifice, Lord Ramacandra, whose lotus
feet were sometimes pierced by thorns when He lived in
Dandakaranya, placed those lotus feet in the hearts of those who
always think of Him. Then He entered His own abode, the
Vaikuntha planet beyond the brahmajyoti.
PURPORT
The lotus feet of the Lord are always a subject matter for meditation
for devotees. Sometimes when Lord Ramacandra wandered in the forest


--- Page 125 ---
Text 19] Lord Ramacandra Rules the World 119
of Dandakaranya, thorns pricked His lotus feet. The devotees, upon
thinking of this, would faint. The Lord does not feel pain or pleasure
from any action or reaction of this material world, but the devotees can-
not tolerate even the pricking of the Lord’s lotus feet by a thorn. This
was the attitude of the gopis when they thought of Krsna wandering in
the forest, with pebbles and grains of sand pricking His lotus feet. This
tribulation in the heart of a devotee cannot be understood by karmis,
jAanis or yogis. The devotees, who could not tolerate even thinking of the
Lord’s lotus feet being pricked by a thorn, were again put into tribulation
by thinking of the Lord’s disappearance, for the Lord had to return to
His abode after finishing His pastimes in this material world.

The word atma-jyotih is significant. The brahmajyoti, which is greatly
appreciated by janis, or monistic philosophers who desire to enter it for
liberation, is nothing but the rays of the Lord’s body.

“I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is endowed with great
power. The glowing effulgence of His transcendental form is the imper-
sonal Brahman, which is absolute, complete and unlimited and which
displays the varieties of countless planets, with their different opulences,
in millions and millions of universes.” (Brahma-samhita 5.40) The
brahmajyoti is the beginning of the spiritual world, and beyond the
brahmajyoti are the Vaikuntha planets. In other words, the brahmajyoti
stays outside the Vaikuntha planets, just as the sunshine stays outside the
sun. To enter the sun planet, one must go through the sunshine.
Similarly, when the Lord or His devotees enter the Vaikuntha planets,
they go through the brahmajyoti. The jianis, or monistic philosophers,
because of their impersonal conception of the Lord, cannot enter the
Vaikuntha planets, but they also cannot stay eternally in the
brahmajyoti. Thus after some time they fall again to this material world.

Lord Ramacandra’s reputation for having killed Ravana with
showers of arrows at the request of the demigods and for having
built a bridge over the ocean does not constitute the factual glory
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord Ramacandra, whose
spiritual body is always engaged in various pastimes. Lord
Ramacandra has no equal or superior, and therefore He had no
need to take help from the monkeys to gain victory over Ravana.

“The Supreme Lord has nothing to do, and no one is found to be equal to
or greater than Him, for everything is done naturally and systematically
by His multifarious energies.” The Lord has nothing to do (na tasya
karyam karanam ca vidyate); whatever He does is His pastime. The
Lord has no duty to perform to oblige anyone. Nonetheless, He appears to
act to protect His devotees or kill His enemies. Of course, no one can be
the Lord’s enemy, since who could be more powerful than the Lord?
There is actually no question of anyone’s being His enemy, but when the
Lord wants to take pleasure in pastimes, He comes down to this material
world and acts like a human being, thus showing His wonderful, glorious
activities to please the devotees. His devotees always want to see the Lord
victorious in varied activities, and therefore, to please Himself and them,
the Lord sometimes agrees to act as a human being and perform wonder-
ful, uncommon pastimes for the satisfaction of the devotees.

ing down with their helmets. Let me offer my obeisances unto His
lotus feet.

Text 22] Lord Ramacandra Rules the World 123
TRANSLATION
Lord Ramacandra returned to His abode, to which bhakti-yogis
are promoted. This is the place to which all the inhabitants of
Ayodhya went after they served the Lord in His manifest pastimes
by offering Him obeisances, touching His lotus feet, fully observ-
ing Him as a fatherlike King, sitting or lying down with Him like
equals, or even just accompanying Him.
PURPORT
The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (4.9):
Jjanma karma ca me divyam
evar yo vetti tattvatah
tyaktva deham punar janma
naiti mam eti so ’rjuna
“One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and
activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this ma-
terial world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.” Here this is con-
firmed. All the inhabitants of Ayodhya who saw Lord Ramacandra as
citizens, served Him as servants, sat and talked with Him as friends or
were somehow or other present during His reign went back home, back
to Godhead. After giving up the body, the devotee who becomes perfect
in devotional service enters that particular universe where Lord
Ramacandra or Lord Krsna is engaged in His pastimes. Then, after being
trained to serve the Lord in various capacities in that prakata-lila, the
devotee is finally promoted to sanatana-dhama, the supreme abode in
the spiritual world. This sanatana-dhama is also mentioned in
Bhagavad-gita (paras tasmat tu bhavo ‘nyo 'vyakto 'vyaktat sanatanah).
One who enters the transcendental pastimes of the Lord is called nitya-
lila-pravista. To understand clearly why Lord Ramacandra returned, it is
mentioned herewith that the Lord went to that particular place where the
bhakti-yogis go. The impersonalists misunderstand the statements of
Srimad-Bhagavatam to mean that the Lord entered His own effulgence
and therefore become impersonal. But the Lord is a person, and His


--- Page 130 ---
124 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 11
devotees are persons. Indeed, the living entities, like the Lord, were per-
sons in the past, they are persons in the present, and they will continue to
be persons even after giving up the body. This is also confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita.

TRANSLATION
O King Pariksit, anyone who aurally receives the narrations
concerning the characteristics of Lord Ramacandra’s pastimes will
ultimately be freed from the disease of envy and thus be liberated
from the bondage of fruitive activities.
PURPORT
Here in this material world, everyone is envious of someone else. Even
in religious life, it is sometimes found that if one devotee has advanced
in spiritual activities, other devotees are envious of him. Such envious
devotees are not completely freed from the bondage of birth and death.
As long as one is not completely free from the cause of birth and death,
one cannot enter the sandtana-dhama or the eternal pastimes of the
Lord. One becomes envious because of being influenced by the designa-
tions of the body, but the liberated devotee has nothing to do with the


--- Page 131 ---
Text 24] Lord Ramacandra Rules the World 125
body, and therefore he is completely on the transcendental platform. A
devotee is never envious of anyone, even his enemy. Because the devotee
knows that the Lord is his supreme protector, he thinks, “What harm
can the so-called enemy 00?” Thus a devotee is confident about his pro-
tection. The Lord says, ye yatha mam prapadyante tars tathaiva
bhajamy aham: “According to the proportion of one’s surrender unto
Me, I respond accordingly.” A devotee must therefore be completely free
from envy, especially of other devotees. To envy other devotees is a great
offense, a wvaisnava-aparadha. A devotee who constantly engages in
hearing and chanting (Sravana-kirtana) is certainly freed from the dis-
ease of envy, and thus he becomes eligible to go back home, back to
Godhead.

Sukadeva Gosvami replied: After accepting the throne of the
government by the fervent request of His younger brother
Bharata, Lord Ramacandra ordered His younger brothers to go out
and conquer the entire world, while He personally remained in the
capital to give audience to all the citizens and residents of the
palace and supervise the governmental affairs with His other
assistants.
PURPORT
The Supreme Personality of Godhead does not allow any of His devo-
tees or assistants to be engaged in sense gratification. The younger
brothers of Lord Ramacandra were at home enjoying the personal pres-
ence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the Lord ordered Them


--- Page 133 ---
Text 25] Lord Ramacandra Rules the World 127
to go out and achieve victory all over the world. It was the custom (and
this custom, in some places, is still current) that all other kings would
have to accept the supremacy of the emperor. If the king of a small state
did not accept the emperor’s supremacy, there would be a fight, and the
king of the small state would be obliged to accept the emperor as
supreme; otherwise, it would not be possible for the emperor to rule the
country.

Lord Ramacandra showed His favor to His brothers by ordering Them
to go out. Many of the Lord’s devotees residing in Vrndavana have taken
the vow not to leave Vrndavana to preach Krsna consciousness. But the
Lord says that Krsna consciousness should be spread all over the world,
in every village and every town. This is the open order of Lord Caitanya
Mahaprabhu.

prthivite ache yata nagaradi grama

sarvatra pracara haibe mora nama
A pure devotee, therefore, must execute the order of the Lord and must
not gratify his senses by remaining stagnant in one place, falsely proud,
thinking that because he does not leave Vrndavana but chants in a soli-
tary place he has become a great devotee. A devotee must carry out the
order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Caitanya Mahaprabhu
said, yare dekha, tare kaha ‘krsna’-upadesa. Every devotee, therefore,
should spread Krsna consciousness by preaching, asking whomever he
meets to accept the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The
Lord says, sarva-dharman parityajya mam 6107 Saranam vraja:
“Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me.” This is
the order of the Lord, who speaks as the supreme emperor. Everyone
should be induced to accept this order, for this is victory (dig-vijaya).
And it is the duty of the soldier, the devotee, to impress upon everyone
this philosophy of life.

Of course, those who are kanistha-adhikaris do not preach, but the
Lord shows mercy to them also, as He did by staying personally in
Ayodhya to give audience to the people in general. One should not
mistakenly think that the Lord asked His younger brothers to leave
Ayodhya because He especially favored the citizens. The Lord is merciful
to everyone, and He knows how to show His favor to each individual


--- Page 134 ---
128 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 11
person according to his capacity. One who abides by the order of the Lord
is a pure devotee.

TRANSLATION

During the reign of Lord Ramacandra, the streets of the capital,
Ayodhya, were sprinkled with perfumed water and drops of per-
fumed liquor, thrown about by elephants from their trunks.
When the citizens saw the Lord personally supervising the affairs
of the city in such opulence, they appreciated this opulence very
much.

PURPORT

We have simply heard about the opulence of Rama-rajya during the
reign of Lord Ramacandra. Now, here is one example of the opulence of
the Lord’s kingdom. The streets of Ayodhya were not only cleaned but
also sprinkled with perfumed water and drops of perfumed liquor, which
were distributed by elephants through their trunks. There was no need
of sprinkling machines, for the elephant has a natural ability to suck
water through its trunk and again throw it out in a shower. We can
understand the opulence of the city from this one example: it was ac-
tually sprinkled with perfumed water. Moreover, the citizens had the op-
portunity to see the Lord personally supervising the affairs of the state.


--- Page 135 ---
Text 27] Lord Ramacandra Rules the World 129
He was not a sleeping monarch, as we can understand from His activities
in sending His brothers to see to affairs outside the capital and punish
anyone who did not obey the emperor’s orders. This is called dig-vijaya.
The citizens were all given facilities for peaceful life, and they were
also qualified with appropriate attributes according to varndsrama. As
we have seen from the previous chapter, varnasrama-gunanvitah: the
citizens were trained according to the varnasrama system. A class of men
were brahmanas, a class of men were ksatriyas, a class were waiSyas, and
a class were Sizdras. Without this scientific division, there can be no ques-
tion of good citizenship. The King, being magnanimous and perfect in
His duty, performed many sacrifices and treated the citizens as His sons,
and the citizens, being trained in the varnasrama system, were obedient
and perfectly ordered. The entire monarchy was so opulent and peaceful
that the government was even able to sprinkle the street with perfumed
water, what to speak of other management. Since the city was sprinkled
with perfumed water, we can simply imagine how opulent it was in other
respects. Why should the citizens not have felt happy during the reign of
Lord Ramacandra?

Ramacandra, they showered flowers upon Him.

was decorated with flags and garlands and bedecked with valuable
stones, shining with a celestial effulgence. The palace was fully
decorated with pearls and surrounded by lamps and incense. The
men and women within the palace all resembled demigods and
were decorated with various ornaments, which seemed beautiful
because of being placed on their bodies.

CHAPTER TWELVE
The Dynasty of Kusa,
the Son of Lord Ramacandra
This chapter describes the dynasty of Kuga, the son of Lord Ramacandra.
The members of this dynasty are descendants of Sasada, the son of
Maharaja Iksvaku.

Following in the genealogical table of Lord Ramacandra’s dynasty,
Kusa, the Lord’s son, was followed consecutively by Atithi, Nisadha,
Nabha, Pundarika, Ksemadhanva, Devanika, Aniha, Pariyatra,
Balasthala, Vajranabha, Sagana and Vidhrti. These personalities ruled
the world. From Vidhrti came Hiranyanabha, who later became the disci-
ple of Jaimini and propounded the system of mystic yoga in which
Yajiiavalkya was initiated. Following in this dynasty were Puspa,
Dhruvasandhi, Sudar$ana, Agnivarna, Sighra and Maru. Maru attained
full perfection in the practice of yoga, and he still lives in the village of
Kalapa. At the end of this age of Kali, he will revive the dynasty of the
sun-god. Next in the dynasty were Prasusruta, Sandhi, Amarsana,
Mahasvan, Visvabahu, Prasenajit, Taksaka and Brhadbala, who was later
killed by Abhimanyu. Sukadeva Gosvami said that these were all kings
who had passed away. The future descendants of Brhadbala will be
Brhadrana, Urukriya, Vatsavrddha, Prativyoma, Bhanu, Divaka,
Sahadeva, Brhadasva, Bhanuman, Pratikasva, Supratika, Marudeva,
Sunaksatra, Puskara, Antariksa, Sutapa, Amitrajit, Brhadraja, Barhi,
Krtafijaya, Ranafijaya, Safjaya, Sakya, Suddhoda, Langala, Prasenajit,
Ksudraka, Ranaka, Suratha and Sumitra. All of them will become kings
one after another. Sumitra, coming in this age of Kali, will be the last
king in the [19810 dynasty; after him, the dynasty will be extinguished.

TRANSLATION

Having achieved perfection in the power of mystic yoga, Maru
still lives in a place known as Kalapa-grama. At the end of Kali-
yuga, he will revive the lost Surya dynasty by begetting a son.

PURPORT

At least five thousand years ago, Srila Sukadeva Gosvami ascertained
the existence of Maru in Kalapa-grama and said that Maru, having
achieved a yoga-siddha body, would continue to exist until the end of
Kali-yuga, which is calculated to continue for 432,000 years. Such is the
perfection of mystic power. By controlling the breath, the perfect yogi
can continue his life for as long as he likes. Sometimes we hear from the
Vedic literature that some personalities from the Vedic age, such as
Vyasadeva and Asvatthama, are still living. Here we understand that
Maru is also still living. We are sometimes surprised that a mortal body
can live for such a long time. The explanation of this longevity is given
here by the word yoga-siddha. If one becomes perfect in the practice of
yoga, he can live as long as he likes. The demonstration of some trifling
yoga-siddha does not constitute perfection. Here is a factual example of
perfection: a yoga-siddha can live as long as he likes.

CHAPTER THIRTEEN
The Dynasty of Maharaja Nimi
This chapter describes the dynasty in which the great and learned scholar
Janaka was born. This is the dynasty of Maharaja Nimi, who is said to
have been the son of Iksvaku.

When Maharaja Nimi began performing great sacrifices, he appointed
Vasistha to be chief priest, but Vasistha refused, for he had already
agreed to be priest in performing a yajia for Lord Indra. Vasistha
therefore requested Maharaja Nimi to wait until Lord Indra’s sacrifice
was finished, but Maharaja Nimi did not wait. He thought, “Life is very
short, so there is no need to wait.”” He therefore appointed another priest
to perform the yajiia. Vasistha was very angry at King Nimi and cursed
him, saying, “May your body fall down.” Cursed in that way, Maharaja
Nimi also became very angry, and he retaliated by saying, “May your
body also fall down.” As a result of this cursing and countercursing,
both of them died. After this incident, Vasistha took birth again, be-
gotten by Mitra and Varuna, who were agitated by Urvasi.

The priests who were engaged in the sacrifice for King Nimi preserved
Nimi’s body in fragrant chemicals. When the sacrifice was over, the
priests prayed for Nimi’s life to all the demigods who had come to the
arena of yajiia, but Maharaja Nimi refused to take birth again in a ma-
terial body because he considered the material body obnoxious. The great
sages then churned Nimi’s body, and as a result of this churning, Janaka
was born.

The son of Janaka was Udavasu, and the son of Udavasu was
Nandivardhana. The son of Nandivardhana was Suketu, and his descen-
dants continued as follows: Devarata, Brhadratha, Mahavirya, Sudhrti,
Dhrstaketu, Haryaéva, Maru, Pratipaka, Krtaratha, Devamidha, Viéruta,
Mahadhrti, Krtirata, Maharoma, Svarparoma, Hrasvaroma and
Siradhvaja. All these sons appeared in the dynasty one after another.
From Siradhvaja, mother Sitadevi was born. Siradhvaja’s son was
Kusadhvaja, and the son of Kusadhvaja was Dharmadhvaja. The sons of
Dharmadhvaja were Krtadhvaja and Mitadhvaja. The son of Krtadhvaja

149


--- Page 154 ---
150 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 13
was Kesidhvaja, and the son of Mitadhvaja was Khandikya. Kesidhvaja
was a self-realized soul, and his son was Bhanuman, whose descendants
were as follows: Satadyumna, Suci, Sanadvaja, Urjaketu, Aja, Puruyjit,
Aristanemi, Srutdyu, Suparévaka, Citraratha, Ksemadhi, Samaratha,
Satyaratha, Upaguru, Upagupta, Vasvananta, Yuyudha, Subhasana,
Sruta, Jaya, Vijaya, Rta, Sunaka, Vitahavya, Dhrti, Bahulasva, Krti and
Mahavasi. All of these sons were great self-controlled personalities. This
completes the list of the entire dynasty.

TRANSLATION

Maharaja Nimi, being a self-realized soul, considered that this
life is flickering. Therefore, instead of waiting long for Vasistha,
he began performing the sacrifice with other priests.

PURPORT

Canakya Pandita says, Sariramm ksana-vidhvamsi kalpanta-sthayino
gunah: “The duration of one’s life in the material world may end at any
moment, but if within this life one does something worthy, that
qualification is depicted in history eternally.” Here is a great personality,
Maharaja Nimi, who knew this fact. In the human form of life one
should perform activities in such a way that at the end he goes back
home, back to Godhead. This is self-realization.

TRANSLATION
For unnecessarily cursing him when he had committed no
offense, Maharaja Nimi countercursed his spiritual master. ‘‘For
the sake of getting contributions from the King of heaven,” he
said, ‘‘you have lost your religious intelligence. Therefore I pro-
nounce this curse: your body also will fall.”
PURPORT
The religious principle for a brahmana is that he should not be greedy
at all. In this case, however, for the sake of more lucrative remunerations
from the King of heaven, Vasistha neglected Maharaja Nimi’s request on
this planet, and when Nimi performed the sacrifices with other priests,
Vasistha unnecessarily cursed him. When one is infected by contami-
nated activities, his power, material or spiritual, reduces. Although
Vasistha was the spiritual master of Maharaja Nimi, because of his greed
he became fallen.

After saying this, Maharaja Nimi, who was expert in the science
of spiritual knowledge, gave up his body. Vasistha, the great-

charged by Mitra and Varuna when they saw Urvasi, he was born
again.
PURPORT
Mitra and Varuna chanced to meet Urvasi, the most beautiful
prostitute of the heavenly kingdom, and they became lusty. Because they
were great saints, they tried to control their lust, but they could not do
so, and thus they discharged semen. This semen was kept carefully in a
waterpot, and Vasistha was born from it.

Maharaja Nimi said, “Please do not imprison me again in a material
body.”

156 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 13
PURPORT

The demigods are in a position many times higher than that of human
beings. Therefore, although the great saints and sages were also powerful
brahmanas, they requested the demigods to revive Maharija Nimi’s
body, which had been preserved in various perfumed balms. One should
not think that the demigods are powerful only in enjoying the senses;
they are also powerful in such deeds as bringing life back to a dead body.
There are many similar instances in the Vedic literature. For example,
according to the history of Savitri and Satyavian, Satyavan died and was
being taken away by Yamaraja, but on the request of his wife, Savitri,
Satyavan was revived in the same body. This is an important fact about
the power of the demigods.

TRANSLATION

Maharaja Nimi continued: Mayavadis generally want freedom
from accepting a material body because they fear having to give it
up again. But devotees whose intelligence is always filled with the
service of the Lord are unafraid. Indeed, they take advantage of
the body to render transcendental loving service.

Text 9] The Dynasty of Maharaja Nimi 157
PURPORT

Maharaja Nimi did not want to accept a material body, which would be
a cause of bondage; because he was a devotee, he wanted a body by which
he could render devotional service to the Lord. Srila Bhaktivineda
Thakura sings: Jjanmaobi more iccha yadi tora

bhakta-grhe jani janma ha-u mora

kita-janma ha-u yatha tuya dasa
“My Lord, if You want me to take birth and accept a material body again,
kindly do me this favor: allow me to take birth in the home of Your ser-
vant, Your devotee. I do not mind being born there even as an insignifi-
cant creature like an insect.” Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu also said:

na dhanam na janam na sundarim
kavitarm va jagadisa kamaye
mama janmani janmanisvare

bhavatad bhaktir ahaituki tvayi
“0 Lord of the universe, I do not desire material wealth, materialistic
followers, a beautiful wife or fruitive activities described in flowery
language. All I want, life after life, is unmotivated devotional service to
You.” (Siksastaka 4) By saying “life after life” (janmani janmani), the
Lord referred not to an ordinary birth but a birth in which to remember
the lotus feet of the Lord. Such a body is desirable. A devotee does not
think like yogis and jAdnis, who want to refuse a material body and be-
come one with the impersonal Brahman effulgence. A devotee does not
like this idea. On the contrary, he will accept any body, material or spiri-
tual, for he wants to serve the Lord. This is real liberation.

If one has a strong desire to serve the Lord, even if he accepts a ma-
terial body, there is no cause of anxiety, since a devotee, even in a ma-
terial body, is a liberated soul. This is confirmed by Srila Ripa Gosvami:

tha yasya harer ddasye
karmana manasa gira

nikhilasv apy avasthasu
Jivan-muktah sa ucyate


--- Page 162 ---
158 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 13
“A person acting in Krsna consciousness (or, in other words, in the ser-
vice of Krsna) with his body, mind, intelligence and words is a liberated
person even within the material world, although he may be engaged in
many so-called material activities.” The desire to serve the Lord
establishes one as liberated in any condition of life, whether in a spiritual
body or a material body. In a spiritual body the devotee becomes a direct
associate of the Lord, but even though a devotee may superficially appear
to be in a material body, he is always liberated and is engaged in the same
duties of service to the Lord as a devotee in Vaikunthaloka. There is no
distinction. It is said, sadhur jivo va maro va. Whether a devotee 15 alive
or dead, his only concern is to serve the Lord. Tyaktva dehari punar
Janma naiti mam eti. When he gives up his body, he goes directly to be-
come an associate of the Lord and serve Him, although he does the same
thing even in a material body in the material world.

For a devotee there is no pain, pleasure or material perfection. One
may argue that at the time of death a devotee also suffers because of giv-
ing up his material body. But in this connection the example may be
given that a cat carries a mouse in its mouth and also carries a kitten in
its mouth. Both the mouse and the kitten are carried in the same mouth,
but the perception of the mouse is different from that of the kitten.
When a devotee gives up his body (tyaktva deham), he is ready to go
back home, back to Godhead. Thus his perception is certainly different
from that of a person being taken away by Yamaraja for punishment. A
person whose intelligence is always concentrated upon the service of the
Lord is unafraid of accepting a material body, whereas a nondevotee,
having no engagement in the service of the Lord, is very much afraid of
accepting a material body or giving up his present one. Therefore, we
should follow the instruction of Caitanya Mahaprabhu: mama janmani
Janmanisvare bhavatad bhalktir ahaituki tvayi. It doesn’t matter whether
we accept a material body or a spiritual body; our only ambition should
be to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

deham—a material body; na—not; avarurutse—desire to accept;
aham—1; duhkha-$oka-bhaya-avaham—which is the cause of all kinds
of distress, lamentation and fear; sarvatra—always and everywhere
within this universe; asya—of the living entities who have accepted ma-

terial bodies; yatah—because; mrtyuh—death; matsyanam—of the

TRANSLATION

I do not wish to accept a material body, for such a body is the
source of all distress, lamentation and fear, everywhere in the uni-
verse, just as it is for a fish in the water, which lives always in
anxiety because of fear of death.

PURPORT

The material body, whether in the higher or lower planetary system, is
destined to die. In the lower planetary system or lower species of life one
may die soon, and in the higher planets or higher species one may live
for a long, long time, but death is inevitable. This fact should be under-
stood. In the human form of life one should take the opportunity to put
an end to birth, death, old age and disease by performing tapasya. This is
the aim of human civilization: to stop the repetition of birth and death,
which is called mrtyu-sarisara-vartmani. This can be done only when
one is Krsna conscious, or has achieved the service of the lotus feet of the
Lord. Otherwise one must rot in this material world and accept a material
body subject to birth, death, old age and disease.

The example given here is that water is a very nice place for a fish, but
the fish is never free from anxiety about death, since big fish are always
eager to eat the small fish. Phalgiini tatra mahatam: all living entities
are eaten by bigger living entities. This is the way of material nature.

“Those who are devoid of hands are prey for those who have hands;
those devoid of legs are prey for the four-legged. The weak are the sub-
sistence of the strong, and the general rule holds that one living being is
food for another.” (Bhag. 1.13.47) The Supreme Personality of Godhead
has created the material world in such a way that one living entity is food
for another. Thus there is a struggle for existence, but although we speak
of survival of the fittest, no one can escape death without becoming a
devotee of the Lord. [077 vina naiva srtirh taranti: one cannot escape
the cycle of birth and death without becoming a devotee. This is also con-
firmed in Bhagavad-gita (9.3). Aprapya mari nivartante mrtyu-
sarsara-vartmani. One who does not attain shelter at the lotus feet of
Krsna must certainly wander up and down within the cycle of birth and
death.

TRANSLATION

The demigods said: Let Maharaja Nimi live without a material
body. Let him live in a spiritual body as a personal associate of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, and, according to his desire, let
him be manifest or unmanifest to common materially embodied
people.

PURPORT

The demigods wanted Maharaja Nimi to come to life, but Maharaja
Nimi did not want to accept another material body. Under the circum-
stances, the demigods, having been requested by the saintly persons,
gave him the benediction that he would be able to stay in his spiritual
body. There are two kinds of spiritual bodies, as generally understood by
common men. The term “spiritual body” is sometimes taken to refer to a
ghostly body. An impious man who dies after sinful activities is some-
times condemned so that he cannot possess a gross material body of five
material elements, but must live in a subtle body of mind, intelligence
and ego. However, as explained in Bhagavad-gita, devotees can give up
the material body and attain a spiritual body free from all material
tinges, gross and subtle (tyaktva deharit punar janma naiti mam eti so
’rjuna). Thus the demigods gave King Nimi the benediction that he
would be able to stay in a purely spiritual body, free from all gross and
subtle material contamination.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead can be seen or unseen according
to His own transcendental desire; similarly, a devotee, being jivan-
mukta, can be seen or not, as he chooses. As stated in Bhagavad-gita,
nahar prakdasah sarvasya yogamaya-samavrtah: the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead, Krsna, is not manifest to everyone and anyone. To
the common man He is unseen. Atah $ri-krsna-namadi na bhaved
grahyam indriyaih: Krsna and His name, fame, qualities and parapher-
nalia cannot be materially understood. Unless one is advanced in spiri-
tual life (sevonmukhe hi jihvadau), one cannot see Krsna. Therefore the
ability to see Krsna depends on Krsna’s mercy. The same privilege of
being seen or unseen according to one’s own desire was given to
Maharaja Nimi. Thus he lived in his original, spiritual body as an associ-
ate of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

PURPORT
Arajaka-bhayam. If the government is unsteady and unregulated,
there is danger of fear for the people. At the present moment this danger
always exists because of government by the people. Here we can see that
the great sages got a son from Nimi’s material body to guide the citizens
properly, for such guidance is the duty of a ksatriya king. A ksatriya is
one who saves the citizens from being injured. In the so-called people’s
government there is no trained ksatriya king; as soon as someone strong
accumulates votes, he becomes the minister or president, without train-
ing from the learned brahmanas expert in the 5650705. Indeed, we see
that in some countries the government changes from party to party, and
therefore the men in charge of the government are more eager to protect
their position than to see that the citizens are happy. The Vedic civi-
lization prefers monarchy. People liked the government of Lord
Ramacandra, the government of Maharaja Yudhisthira and the govern-
ments of Maharaja Pariksit, Maharaja Ambarisa and Maharaja Prahlada.

Text 14] The Dynasty of Maharaja Nimi 163
There are many instances of excellent government under a monarch.
Gradually the democratic government is becoming unfit for the needs of
the people, and therefore some parties are trying to elect a dictator. A
dictatorship is the same as a monarchy, but without a trained leader. Ac-
tually people will be happy when a trained leader, whether a monarch or
a dictator, takes control of the government and rules the people accord-
ing to the standard regulations of the authorized scriptures.

TRANSLATION

Sukadeva Gosvami said: My dear King Pariksit, all the kings of
the dynasty of Mithila were completely in knowledge of their spiri-
tual identity. Therefore, even though staying at home, they were
liberated from the duality of material existence.

PURPORT

This material world is called dvaita, or duality. The Caitanya-

caritamrta (Antya 4.176) says:
‘dvaite’ bhadrabhadra-jiana, saba— ‘manodharma’
‘et 01010, et manda,”—ei saba ‘bhrama’

In the world of duality —that is to say, in the material world —so-called
goodness and badness are both the same. Therefore, in this world, to dis-
tinguish between good and bad, happiness and distress, is meaningless
because they are both mental concoctions (manodharma). Because every-
thing here is miserable and troublesome, to create an artificial situation
and pretend it to be full of happiness is simply illusion. The liberated
person, being above the influence of the three modes of material nature,


--- Page 176 ---
172 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 13
is unaffected by such dualities in all circumstances. He remains Krsna
conscious by tolerating so-called happiness and distress. This is also con-
firmed in Bhagavad-gita (2.14):
matra-sparsas tu kaunteya
Sitosna-sukha-duhkhadah
agamapayino ‘nityas
tars titiksasva bharata

“0 son of Kunti, the nonpermanent appearance of happiness and dis-
tress, and their disappearance in due course, are like the appearance and
disappearance of winter and summer seasons. They arise from sense per-
ception, O scion of Bharata, and one must learn to tolerate them without
being disturbed.” Those who are liberated, being on the transcendental
platform of rendering service to the Lord, do not care about so-called
happiness and distress. They know that these are like changing seasons,
which are perceivable by contact with the material body. Happiness and
distress come and go. Therefore a pandita, a learned man, is not con-
cerned with them. As it is said, gatdsiin agatasims ca nanusocanti
panditah. The body is dead from the very beginning because it is a lump
of matter. It has no feelings of happiness and distress. Because the soul
within the body is in the bodily concept of life, he suffers happiness and
distress, but these come and go. It is understood herewith that the kings
born in the dynasty of Mithila were all liberated persons, unaffected by
the so-called happiness and distress of this world.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Thirteenth
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “The Dynasty of Maharaja
Nimi.”

CHAPTER FOURTEEN
King Puriirava Enchanted by Urvasi
The summary of this Fourteenth Chapter is given as follows. This
chapter describes Soma and how he kidnapped the wife of Brhaspati and
begot in her womb a son named Budha. Budha begot Purirava, who
begot six sons, headed by Ayu, in the womb of Urvaéi.

Lord Brahma was born from the lotus that sprouted from the navel of
Garbhodakasayi Visnu. Brahma had a son named Atri, and Atri’s son was
Soma, the king of all drugs and stars. Soma became the conqueror of the
entire universe, and, being inflated with pride, he kidnapped Tara, who
was the wife of Brhaspati, the spiritual master of the demigods. A great
fight ensued between the demigods and the asuras, but Brahma rescued
Brhaspati’s wife from the clutches of Soma and returned her to her hus-
band, thus stopping the fighting. In the womb of Tara, Soma begot a son
named Budha, who later begot in the womb of Ila a son named Aila, or
Puriirava. Urvaéi was captivated by Puriarava’s beauty, and therefore
she lived with him for some time, but when she left his company he be-
came almost like a madman. While traveling all over the world, he met
Urvasi again at Kuruksetra, but she agreed to join with him for only one
night in a year.

One year later, Puriirava saw Urvaséi at Kuruksetra and was glad to be
with her for one night, but when he thought of her leaving him again, he
was overwhelmed by grief. Urvasi then advised Puriirava to worship the
Gandharvas. Being satisfied with Purirava, the Gandharvas gave him a
woman known as Agnisthali. Purirava mistook Agnisthali for Urvasi,
but while he was wandering in the forest his misunderstanding was
cleared, and he immediately gave up her company. After returning home
and meditating upon Urvasi all night, he wanted to perform a Vedic
ritualistic ceremony to satisfy his desire. Thereafter he went to the same
place where he had left Agnisthali, and there he saw that from the womb
of a Sami tree had come an asvattha tree. Purirava made two sticks from
this tree and thus produced a fire. By such a fire one can satisfy all lusty
desires. The fire was considered the son of Purirava. In Satya-yuga there
was only one social division, called harisa; there were no divisions of

173

varna like brahmana, ksatriya, vaiSya and Sidra. The Veda was the
कका. The various demigods were not worshiped, for only the
Supreme Personality of Godhead was the worshipable Deity.

--- Page 180 ---
176 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 14
PURPORT
According to the Vedic description, Soma, the moon-god, was born
from the mind of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (candrama
manaso jatah). But here we find that Soma was born from the tears in
the eyes of Atri. This appears contradictory to the Vedic information, but
actually it is not, for this birth of the moon is understood to have taken
place in another millennium. When tears appear in the eyes because of
jubilation, the tears are soothing. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura
says, drgbhya anandasrubhya ata evamrtamayah: “Here the word
drgbhyah means ‘from tears of jubilation.” Therefore the moon-god is
called amrtamayah, ‘full of soothing rays.” In the Fourth Canto of
Srimad-Bhagavatam (4.1.15) we find this verse:
atreh patny anasiya trin
(प्रा suyasasah sutin
0007) 08710505071 somam
atmesa-brahma-sambhavan
This verse describes that Anasiiya, the wife of Atri Rsi, bore three
sons— Soma, Durvasa and Dattatreya. It is said that at the time of con-
ception Anasiiya was impregnated by the tears of Atri.

puffed up, he forcibly kidnapped Brhaspati’s wife, whose name
was Tara.

TRANSLATION

Because of enmity between Brhaspati and Sukra, Sukra took the
side of the moon-god and was joined by the demons. But Lord
Siva, because of affection for the son of his spiritual master, joined
the side of Brhaspati and was accompanied by all the ghosts and
hobgoblins.

PURPORT

The moon-god is one of the demigods, but to fight against the other
demigods he took the assistance of the demons. Sukra, being an enemy of
Brhaspati, also joined the moon-god to retaliate in wrath against
Brhaspati. To counteract this situation, Lord Siva, who was affectionate
toward Brhaspati, joined Brhaspati. The father of Brhaspati was Angira,
from whom Lord Siva had received knowledge. Therefore Lord Siva had
some affection for Brhaspati and joined his side in this fight. Sridhara
Svami remarks, arigirasah sakasat prapta-vidyo hara iti prasiddhah:
“Lord Siva is well known to have received knowledge from Angira.”

TRANSLATION

Brhaspati said: You foolish woman, your womb, which was
meant for me to impregnate, has been impregnated by someone
other than me. Immediately deliver your child! Immediately
deliver it! Be assured that after the child is delivered, I shall not
burn you to ashes. I know that although you are unchaste, you
wanted a son. Therefore I shall not punish you.

PURPORT

Tara was married to Brhaspati, and therefore as a chaste woman she
should have been impregnated by him. But instead she preferred to be
impregnated by Soma, the moon-god, and therefore she was unchaste.
Although Brhaspati accepted Tara from Brahma, when he saw that she
was pregnant he wanted her to deliver a son immediately. Tara certainly
very much feared her husband, and she thought she might be punished
after giving birth. Thus Brhaspati assured her that he would not punish
her, for although she was unchaste and had become pregnant illicitly,
she wanted a son.

TRANSLATION

Urvasi replied: O most handsome man, who is the woman whose
mind and sight would not be attracted by you? If a woman takes
shelter of your chest, she cannot refuse to enjoy with you in a
sexual relationship.

PURPORT

When a beautiful man and a beautiful woman unite together and
embrace one another, how within these three worlds can they check their
sexual relationship? Therefore Srimad-Bhagavatam (7.9.45) says, yan
maithunadi-grhamedhi-sukham hi tuccham.

TRANSLATION

My dear King Purirava, please give protection to these two
lambs, who have fallen down with me. Although I belong to the
heavenly planets and you belong to earth, I shall certainly enjoy
sexual union with you. I have no objection to accepting you as my
husband, for you are superior in every respect.

188 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 14
PURPORT

As stated in the Brahma-sarihita (5.40), yasya prabha prabhavato
Jagad-anda-koti-kotisv  asesa-vasudhadi-vibhiti-bhinnam. There are
various planets and various atmospheres within this universe. The at-
mosphere of the heavenly planet from which Urvasi descended after
being cursed by Mitra and Varuna was different from the atmosphere of
this earth. Indeed, the inhabitants of the heavenly planets are certainly
far superior to the inhabitants of earth. Nonetheless, Urvasi agreed to
remain the consort of Puriirava, although she belonged to a superior
community. A woman who finds a man with superior qualities may ac-
cept such a man as her husband. Similarly, if a man finds a woman who
is from an inferior family but who has good qualities, he can accept such
a brilliant wife, as advised by Sri Canakya Pandita (stri-ratnar duskulad
api). The combination of male and female is worthwhile if the qualities
of both are on an equal level.

TRANSLATION

Urvasi said: “My dear hero, only preparations made in ghee
[clarified butter] will be my eatables, and I shall not want to see
you naked at any time, except at the time of sexual intercourse.”
The great-minded King Puriirava accepted these proposals.

TRANSLATION

Puriirava replied: O beautiful one, your beauty is wonderful
and your gestures are also wonderful. Indeed, you are attractive to
all human society. Therefore, since you have come of your own ac-
cord from the heavenly planets, who on earth would not agree to
serve a demigoddess such as you.

PURPORT

It appears from the words of Urvasi that the standard of living, eating,
behavior and speech are all different on the heavenly planets from the
standards on this planet earth. The inhabitants of the heavenly planets
do not eat such abominable things as meat and eggs; everything they eat
is prepared in clarified butter. Nor do they like to see either men or
women naked, except at the time of sexual intercourse. To live naked or
almost naked is uncivilized, but on this planet earth it has now become
fashionable to dress half naked, and sometimes those like hippies live
completely naked. Indeed, there are many clubs and societies for this
purpose. Such conduct is not allowed, however, on the heavenly planets.
The inhabitants of the heavenly planets, aside from being very beautiful,
both in complexion and bodily features, are well behaved and long-
living, and they eat first-class food in goodness. These are some of the

distinctions between the inhabitants of the heavenly planets and the
inhabitants of earth.

lambs.

is no use making friendship with women.


--- Page 202 ---
198 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 14
PURPORT

Canakya Pandita has advised, visvdaso naiva kartavyah strisu raja-
kulesu ca: “Never place your faith in a woman or a politician.” Unless
elevated to spiritual consciousness, everyone is conditioned and fallen,
what to speak of women, who are less intelligent than men. Women have
been compared to siidras and vaisyas (striyo vaisyas tatha sudrah). On
the spiritual platform, however, when one is elevated to the platform of
Krsna consciousness, whether one is a man, woman, sidra or whatever,
everyone is equal. Otherwise, Urvasi, who was a woman herself and who
knew the nature of women, said that a woman’s heart is like that of a sly
fox. If a man cannot control his senses, he becomes a victim of such sly
foxes. But if one can control the senses, there is no chance of his being
victimized by sly, foxlike women. Canakya Pandita has also advised that
if one has a wife like a sly fox, he must immediately give up his life at
home and go to the forest.

mata yasya grhe nasti
bharya capriya-vadini
aranyam tena gantavyam
yatharanyam tatha grham
(Canakya-sloka 57)
Krsna conscious grhasthas must be very careful of the sly fox woman. If
the wife at home is obedient and follows her husband in Krsna conscious-
ness, the home is welcome. Otherwise one should give up one’s home and
go to the forest.
hitvatma-patarn grham andha-kiipam

TRANSLATION
Women as a class are merciless and cunning. They cannot toler-
ate even a slight offense. For their own pleasure they can do any-
thing irreligious, and therefore they do not fear killing even a
faithful husband or brother.
PURPORT
King Puriirava was greatly attached to Urvasi. Yet despite his faithful-
ness to her, she had left him. Now, considering that the King was wasting
his rarely achieved human form of life, Urvasi frankly explained the
nature of a woman. Because of her nature, a woman can respond to even
a slight offense from her husband by not only leaving him but even kill-
ing him if required. To say nothing of her husband, she can even kill her
brother. That is a woman’s nature. Therefore, in the material world, un-
less women are trained to be chaste and faithful to their husbands, there
cannot be peace or prosperity in society.

company of well-wishers; navam—new; navam—new; abhipsantyah—

svaira—independently; vrttayah— professional.

TRANSLATION

Women are very easily seduced by men. Therefore, polluted
women give up the friendship of a man who is their well-wisher
and establish false friendship among fools. Indeed, they seek
newer and newer friends, one after another.

PURPORT

Because women are easily seduced, the Manu-samhita enjoins that
they should not be given freedom. A woman must always be protected,
either by her father, by her husband, or by her elderly son. If women are
given freedom to mingle with men like equals, which they now claim to
be, they cannot keep their propriety. The nature of a woman, as per-
sonally described by Urvasi, is to establish false friendship with someone
and then seek new male companions, one after another, even if this
means giving up the company of a sincere well-wisher.

Although Urvasi had adversely explained the nature of woman,
Maharaja Purirava was very much attached to her, and therefore she
wanted to give the King some concession by agreeing to be his wife for
one night at the end of each year.

TRANSLATION

Urvasi said: “My dear King, seek shelter of the Gandharvas, for
they will be able to deliver me to you again.” In accordance with
these words, the King satisfied the Gandharvas by prayers, and the
Gandharvas, being pleased with him, gave him an Agnisthali girl
who looked exactly like Urvasi. Thinking that the girl was Urvasi,
the King began walking with her in the forest, but later he could
understand that she was not Urvasi but Agnisthali.

PURPORT

Srila Viévanatha Cakravarti Thakura remarks that Puriirava was very
lusty. Immediately after getting the Agnisthali girl, he wanted to have
sex with her, but during sexual intercourse he could understand that the
girl was Agnisthali, not Urvasi. This indicates that every man attached to
a particular woman knows the particular characteristics of that woman
during sex life. Thus Puriirava understood during sexual intercourse
that the Agnisthali girl was not Urvasi.

TRANSLATION
King Puriirava then left Agnisthali in the forest and returned
home, where he meditated all night upon Urvasi. In the course of
his meditation, the Treta millennium began, and therefore the
principles of the three Vedas, including the process of performing
yajiia to fulfill fruitive activities, appeared within his heart.
PURPORT
It is said, tretayam yajato makhaih: in Treta-yuga, if one performed
yajnias, he would get the results of those yajiias. By performing visnu-
yajiia specifically, one could even achieve the lotus feet of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Of course, yajiia is intended to please the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. While Puriirava was meditating upon
Urvasi, the Treta-yuga began, and therefore the Vedic yajiias were
revealed in his heart. But Purirava was a materialistic man, especially
interested in enjoying the senses. Yajriias for enjoyment of the senses are
called karma-kandiya-yajiias. Therefore, he decided to perform karma-
kandiya-yajiias to fulfill his lusty desires. In other words, karma-
kandiya-yajiias are meant for sensuous persons, whereas yajiia should
actually be performed to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. To
please the Supreme Personality of Godhead in Kali-yuga, the sarkirtana-
yajia is recommended. Yajiaih sankirtana-prayair yajanti hi
sumedhasah. Only those who are very intelligent take to sarkirtana-
yajiia to fulfill all their desires, material and spiritual, whereas those
who are lusty for sense enjoyment perform karma-kandiya-yajnas.

TRANSLATION
When the process of fruitive कष 78 became manifest within his
heart, King Puriirava went to the same spot where he had left
Agnisthali. There he saw that from the womb of a §ami tree, an
aSvattha tree had grown. He then took a piece of wood from that
tree and made it into two aranis. Desiring to go to the planet where
Urvasi resided, he chanted mantras, meditating upon the lower
arani as Urvasi, the upper one as himself, and the piece of wood
between them as his son. In this way he began to ignite a fire.
PURPORT
The Vedic fire for performing yajiia was not ignited with ordinary
matches or similar devices. Rather, the Vedic sacrificial fire was ignited
by the aranis, or two sacred pieces of wood, which produced fire by fric-
tion with a third. Such a fire is necessary for the performance of yajiia. If
successful, a yajiia will fulfill the desire of its performer. Thus Purirava
took advantage of the process of yajiia to fulfill his lusty desires. He


--- Page 210 ---
206 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 14
thought of the lower arani as Urvasi, the upper one as himself, and the
middle one as his son. A relevant Vedic mantra quoted herein by
Viévanatha Cakravarti Thakura is Sami-garbhdd agnirm mantha. A simi-
lar mantra is urvasyam urasi puriravah. Purirava wanted to have
children continuously by the womb of Urvasi. His only ambition was to
have sex life with Urvasi and thereby get a son. In other words, he had so
much lust in his heart that even while performing yajiia he thought of
Urvasi, instead of thinking of the master of व्यद, Yajiiesvara, Lord
Visnu.

Vedic principles; vibhavasuh—a fire; trayya—following the Vedic prin-

TRANSLATION
From Puriirava’s rubbing of the aranis came a fire. By such a
fire one can achieve all success in material enjoyment and be
purified in seminal birth, initiation and in the performance of
sacrifice, which are invoked with the combined letters a-u-m. Thus
the fire was considered the son of King Pururava.
PURPORT
According to the Vedic process, one can get a son through semen
(sukra), one can get a bona fide disciple through initiation (savitra), or


--- Page 211 ---
Text 47] King Purirava Enchanted by Urvasi 207
one can get a son or disciple through the fire of sacrifice (০০7০). Thus
when Maharaja Puriirava generated the fire by rubbing the aranis, the
fire became his son. Either by semen, by initiation or by yajiia one may
get a son. The Vedic mantra orikdra, or pranava, consisting of the letters
a-u-m, can call each of these three methods into existence. Therefore the
words nirmanthandj jatah indicate that by the rubbing of the aranis a
son was born.

anvicchan—although desiring to go; sarva-deva-mayam—the reservoir

TRANSLATION

By means of that fire, Puriirava, who desired to go to the planet
where Urvasi resided, performed a sacrifice, by which he satisfied
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, the enjoyer of the
results of sacrifice. Thus he worshiped the Lord, who is beyond
the perception of the senses and is the reservoir of all the
demigods.

PURPORT

As stated in Bhagavad-gita, bhoktaram yajiia-tapasarm sarva-loka-
mahesvaram: any loka, or planet, to which one wants to go is the
property of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the enjoyer of the per-
formance of sacrifice. The purpose of yajiia is to satisfy the Supreme


--- Page 212 ---
208 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 14
Personality of Godhead. In this age, as we have explained many times,
the yajiia of chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra is the only sacrifice
that can satisfy the Supreme Lord. When the Lord is satisfied, one can
fulfill any desire, material or spiritual. Bhagavad-gita (3.14) also says,
yajnad bhavati parjanyah: by offering sacrifices to Lord Visnu, one can
have sufficient rainfall. When there is sufficient rainfall, the earth be-
comes fit to produce everything (sarva-kama-dugha mahi). If one can
utilize the land properly, one can get all the necessities of life from the
land, including food grains, fruits, flowers and vegetables. Everything
one gets for material wealth is produced from the earth, and therefore it
is said, sarva-kdma-dugha mahi (Bhag. 1.10.4). Everything is possible
by performing yajiia. Therefore although Purirava desired something
material, he factually performed yajiia to please the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. The Lord is adhoksaja, beyond the perception of Puriirava
and everyone else. Consequently, some kind of yajiia must be performed
to fulfill the desires of the living entity. Yajiias can be performed in
human society only when society is divided by varnasrama-dharma into
four varnas and four asramas. Without such a regulative process, no one
can perform yajiias, and without the performance of yajiias, no material
plans can make human society happy at any time. Everyone should
therefore be induced to perform yajiias. In this age of Kali, the 20780
recommended is sarikirtana, the individual or collective chanting of the
Hare Krsna maha-mantra. This will bring the fulfillment of all
necessities for human society.

consisting of all Vedic mantras; devah—the Lord, God; narayanah—
only Narayana (was worshipable in the Satya-yuga); na anyah—no
other; ekah agnih—one division only for agni; varnah—order of life;
eva ca—and certainly.
TRANSLATION

In the Satya-yuga, the first millennium, all the Vedic mantras
were included in one mantra—pranava, the root of all Vedic
mantras. In other words, the Atharva Veda alone was the source of
all Vedic knowledge. The Supreme Personality of Godhead
Narayana was the only worshipable Deity; there was no recommen-
dation for worship of the demigods. Fire was one only, and the
only order of life in human society was known as harisa.

PURPORT

In Satya-yuga there was only one Veda, not four. Later, before the
beginning of Kali-yuga, this one Veda, the Atharva Veda (or, some say,
the Yajur Veda), was divided into four — Sama, Yajur, Rg and Atharva—
for the facility of human society. In Satya-yuga the only mantra was
ommkara (om tat sat). The same name omkara is manifest in the mantra
Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare
Rama, Rima Rama, Hare Hare. Unless one is a brahmana, one cannot ut-
ter क्का and get the desired result. But in Kali-yuga almost everyone
is a $izdra, unfit for pronouncing the pranava, omkara. Therefore the
Sastras have recommended the chanting of the Hare Krsna maha-
mantra. Omkara is a mantra, or maha-mantra, and Hare Krsna is also a
maha-mantra. The purpose of pronouncing omkdra is to address the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vasudeva (07 namo bhagavate
vasudevdaya). And the purpose of chanting the Hare Krsna mantra is the
same. Hare: “0 energy of the Lord!” Krsna: “O Lord Krsna!” Hare: “O
energy of the Lord!” Rama: “O Supreme Lord, O supreme enjoyer!”
The only worshipable Lord is Hari, who is the goal of the Vedas (vedais
ca sarvair aham eva vedyah). By worshiping the demigods, one worships
the different parts of the Lord, just as one might water the branches and
twigs of a tree. But worshiping Narayana, the all-inclusive Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead, is like pouring water on the root of the tree, thus


--- Page 214 ---
210 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 14
supplying water to the trunk, branches, twigs, leaves and so on. In Satya-
yuga people knew how to fulfill the necessities of life simply by worship-
ing Narayana, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The same purpose
can be served in this age of Kali by the chanting of the Hare Krsna
manira, as recommended in the Bhagavatam. Kirtanad eva krsnasya
mukta-sangah para vrajet. Simply by chanting the Hare Krsna mantra,
one becomes free from the bondage of material existence and thus be-
comes eligible to return home, back to Godhead.

O Maharaja Pariksit, at the beginning of Treta-yuga, King
Purirava inaugurated a karma-kanda sacrifice. Thus Purirava,
who considered the yajiic fire his son, was able to go to
Gandharvaloka as he desired.
PURPORT
In Satya-yuga, Lord Narayana was worshiped by meditation (krte yad
dhyayato visnum). Indeed, everyone always meditated upon Lord Visnu,
Narayana, and achieved every success by this process of meditation. In
the next yuga, Treta-yuga, the performance of yajiia began (tretayarin

Ritualistic ceremonies are generally called fruitive activities. Srila
Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says that in Treta-yuga, beginning in the
Svayambhuva-manvantara, ritualistic fruitive activities were similarly
manifested from Priyavrata, etc.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Fourteenth
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “King Punirava
Enchanted by Urvasi.”

CHAPTER FIFTEEN
Parasurama,
the Lord’s Warrior Incarnation
This chapter describes the history of Gadhi in the dynasty of Aila.
From the womb of Urvasi came six sons, named Ayu, Srutayu,
Satyayu, Raya, Jaya and Vijaya. The son of Srutayu was Vasuman, the
son of Satyayu was Srutafijaya, the son of Raya was Eka, the son of Jaya
was Amita, and the son of Vijaya was Bhima. Bhima’s son was named
Kaficana, the son of Kaficana was Hotraka, and the son of Hotraka was
Jahnu, who was celebrated for having drunk all the water of the Ganges
in one sip. The descendants of Jahnu, one after another, were Puru,
Balika, Ajaka and Kusa. The sons of Kusa were Kusambu, Tanaya, Vasu
and Kusanabha. From Kusambu came Gadhi, who had a daughter named
Satyavati. Satyavati married Rcika Muni after the muni contributed a
substantial dowry, and from the womb of Satyavati by Rcika Muni,
Jamadagni was born. The son of Jamadagni was Rama, or Parasurama.
When a king named Kartaviryarjuna stole Jamadagni’s desire cow,
Parasurama, who is ascertained by learned experts to be a saktyavesa in-
carnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, killed Karta-
viryarjuna. Later, he annihilated the ksatriya dynasty twenty-one times.
After Parasurama killed Kartaviryarjuna, Jamadagni told him that kill-
ing a king is sinful and that as a brahmana he should have tolerated the
offense. Therefore Jamadagni advised ParaSurama to atone for his sin by
traveling to various holy places.

belong to the dynasty of Kusa. Because we are aristocratic
ksatriyas, you have to give some dowry for my daughter.
Therefore, bring at least one thousand horses, each as brilliant as
moonshine and each having one black ear, whether right or left.”

The son of King Gadhi was Viévamitra, who was said to be a

TRANSLATION
Meanwhile, because Satyavati’s mother thought that the oblation
prepared for her daughter, Rcika’s wife, must be better, she asked
her daughter for that oblation. Satyavati therefore gave her own
oblation to her mother and ate her mother’s oblation herself.

PURPORT
A husband naturally has some affection for his wife. Therefore
Satyavati’s mother thought that the oblation prepared for Satyavati by
the sage Rcika must have been better than her own oblation. In Rcika’s
absence, the mother took the better oblation from Satyavati and ate it.

TRANSLATION
When the great sage Rcika returned home after bathing and
understood what had happened in his absence, he said to his wife,
Satyavati, ‘You have done a great wrong. Your son will be a fierce
ksatriya, able to punish everyone, and your brother will be a
learned scholar in spiritual science.”
PURPORT
A brahmana is highly qualified when he can control his senses and
mind, when he is a learned scholar in spiritual science and when he is
tolerant and forgiving. A ksatriya, however, is highly qualified when he
is fierce in giving punishment to wrongdoers. These qualities are stated
in Bhagavad-gita (18.42-43). Because Satyavati, instead of eating her


--- Page 223 ---
220 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 15
own oblation, had eaten that which was meant for her mother, she would
give birth to a son imbued with the ksatriya spirit. This was undesirable.
The son of a brahmana is generally expected to become.a brahmana, but
if such a son becomes fierce like a ksatriya, he is designated according to
the description of the four varnas in Bhagavad-gita (catur-varnyari
maya ऽकः guna-karma-vibhagasah). If the son of a brahmana does
not become like a brahmana, he may be called a ksatriya, vaisya or
Sudra, according to his qualifications. The basic principle for dividing
society is not a person’s birth but his qualities and actions.

TRANSLATION
Satyavati, however, pacified Rcika Muni with peaceful words and
requested that her son not be like a fierce ksatriya. Rcika Muni
replied, “Then your grandson will be of a ksatriya spirit.” Thus
Jamadagni was born as the son of Satyavati.
PURPORT
The great sage Rcika was very angry, but somehow or other Satyavati
pacified him, and at her request he changed his mind. It is indicated here
that the son of Jamadagni would be born as Parasurama.

TRANSLATION
When the royal dynasty, being excessively proud because of the
material modes of passion and ignorance, became irreligious and


--- Page 226 ---

ceased to care for the laws enacted by the brahmanas, Parasurama
killed them. Although their offense was not very severe, he killed
them to lessen the burden of the world.

PURPORT

The ksatriyas, or the ruling class, must govern the world in accordance
with the rules and regulations enacted by great brahmanas and saintly
persons. As soon as the ruling class becomes irresponsible in regard to
the religious principles, it becomes a burden on the earth. As stated here,
rajas-tamo-vrtari, bharam abrahmanyam: when the ruling class is in-
fluenced by the lower modes of nature, namely ignorance and passion, it
becomes a burden to the world and must then be annihilated by superior
power. We actually see from modern history that monarchies have been
abolished by various revolutions, but unfortunately the monarchies have
been abolished to establish the supremacy of third-class and fourth-class
men. Although monarchies overpowered by the modes of passion and ig-
norance have been abolished in the world, the inhabitants of the world
are still unhappy, for although the qualities of the former monarchs were
degraded by taints of ignorance, these monarchs have been replaced by
men of the mercantile and worker classes whose qualities are even more
degraded. When the government is actually guided by brahmanas, or
God conscious men, then there can be real happiness for the people.
Therefore in previous times, when the ruling class was degraded to the
modes of passion and ignorance, the brahmanas, headed by such a
ksatriya-spirited brahmana as Parasurama, killed them twenty-one
consecutive times.

In Kali-yuga, as stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (12.2.19) dasyu-
prayesu rajasu: the ruling class (rajanya) will be no better than plun-
derers (dasyus) because the third-class and fourth-class men will
monopolize the affairs of the government. Ignoring the religious prin-
ciples and brahminical rules and regulations, they will certainly try to
plunder the riches of the citizens without consideration. As stated
elsewhere in Srimad-Bhagavatam (12.1.40);

asarnskrtah kriya-hina
rajasa tamasavrtah


--- Page 227 ---
224 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 15
prajas te bhaksayisyanti
mleccha rajanya-ripinah
Being unpurified, neglecting to discharge human duties properly, and
being influenced by the modes of passion (rajas) and ignorance (tamas),
unclean people (mlecchas), posing as members of the government
(rajanya-rapinah), will swallow the citizens (prajas te bhaksayisyanti).
And in still another place, Srimad-Bhagavatam (12.2.7-8) says:
9৮077 prajabhir dustabhir
akirne ksiti-mandale
brahma-vit-ksatra-sadranam
yo bali bhavita nrpah
praja hi lubdhai rajanyair
nirghrnair dasyu-dharmabhih
acchinna-ddara-dravina
yasyanti giri-kananam
Human society is naturally grouped into four divisions, as stated in
Bhagavad-gita (catur-varnyam maya srstari guna-karma-vibhagasah).
But if this system is neglected and the qualities and divisions of society
are not considered, the result will be brahma-vit-ksatra-sidranam yo
bali bhavita nrpah: the so-called caste system of brahmana, ksatriya,
vaiSya and $idra will be meaningless. As a result, whoever somehow or
other becomes powerful will be the king or president, and thus the
prajas, or citizens, will be so harassed that they will give up hearth and
home and will go to the forest (yasyanti giri-kananam) to escape harass-
ment by government officials who have no mercy and are addicted to the
ways of plunderers. Therefore the prajas, or the people in general, must
take to the Krsna consciousness movement, the Hare Krsna movement,
which is the sound incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Kali-kale nama-ripe krsna-avatara: Krsna, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, has now appeared as an incarnation by His holy name.
Therefore, when the prajas become Krsna conscious, they can then ex-
pect a good government and good society, a perfect life, and liberation
from the bondage of material existence.

TRANSLATION

The sage Jamadagni, who was engaged in great austerities in the
forest, received the King very well, along with the King’s soldiers,
ministers and carriers. He supplied all the necessities to worship
these guests, for he possessed a kamadhenu cow that was able to
supply everything.

PURPORT

The Brahma-samhita informs us that the spiritual world, and es-
pecially the planet Goloka Vrndavana, where Krsna lives, is full of
surabhi cows (surabhir abhipalayantam). The surabhi cow is also called
kamadhenu. Although Jamadagni possessed only one kamadhenu, he
was able to get from it everything desirable. Thus he was able to receive
the King, along with the King’s great number of followers, ministers,
soldiers, animals and palanquin carriers. When we speak of a king, we
understand that he is accompanied by many followers. Jamadagni was
able to receive all the King’s followers properly and feed them
sumptuously with food prepared in ghee. The King was astonished at
how opulent Jamadagni was because of possessing only one cow, and
therefore he became envious of the great sage. This was the beginning of
his offense. Parasurama, the incarnation of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, killed Kartaviryarjuna because Kartaviryarjuna was too proud.
One may possess unusual opulence in this material world, but if one be-
comes puffed up and acts whimsically he will be punished by the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the lesson to learn from this


--- Page 234 ---

history, in which ParaSurama became angry at Kartaviryarjuna and
killed him and rid the entire world of ksatriyas twenty-one times.

opulence; ati-§dyanam—which was exceeding; tat—that; na—not;
adriyata—appreciated very much; agnihotryam—in that cow, which
was useful for executing the agnihotra sacrifice; sa-abhilasah—became
desirous; sa-haihayah—with his own men, the Haihayas.
TRANSLATION
Kartaviryarjuna thought that Jamadagni was more powerful and
wealthy than himself because of possessing a jewel in the form of
the kamadhenu. Therefore he and his own men, the Haihayas,
were not very much appreciative of Jamadagni’s reception. On the
contrary, they wanted to possess that kamadhenu, which was
useful for the execution of the agnihotra sacrifice.
PURPORT
Jamadagni was more powerful than Kartaviryarjuna because of per-
forming the agnihotra-yajiia with clarified butter received from the
kamadhenu. Not everyone can be expected to possess such a cow. None-
theless, an ordinary man may possess an ordinary cow, give protection to
this animal, take sufficient milk from it, and engage the milk to produce
butter and clarified ghee, especially for performing the agnihotra-yajnia.
This is possible for everyone. Thus we find that in Bhagavad-gita Lord


--- Page 235 ---
232 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 15
Krsna advises go-raksya, the protection of cows. This is essential because
if cows are cared for properly they will surely supply sufficient milk. We
have practical experience in America that in our various ISKCON farms
we are giving proper protection to the cows and receiving more than
enough milk. In other farms the cows do not deliver as much milk as in
our farms; because our cows know very well that we are not going to kill
them, they are happy, and they give ample milk. Therefore this instruc-
tion given by Lord Krsna—go-raksya—is extremely meaningful. The
whole world must learn from Krsna how to live happily without scarcity
simply by producing food grains (annad bhavanti bhitdni) and giving
protection to the cows (go-raksya). Krsi-goraksya-vanijyam vaiSya-
karma svabhavajam. Those who belong to the third level of human
society, namely the mercantile people, must keep land for producing
food grains and giving protection to cows. This is the injunction of
Bhagavad-gita. In the matter of protecting the cows, the meat-eaters will
protest, but in answer to them we may say that since Krsna gives stress to
cow protection, those who are inclined to eat meat may eat the flesh of
unimportant animals like hogs, dogs, goats and sheep, but they should
not touch the life of the cows, for this is destructive to the spiritual
advancement of human society. i

TRANSLATION
Being puffed up by material power, Kartaviryarjuna encouraged
his men to steal Jamadagni’s kamadhenu. Thus the men forcibly
took away the crying kamadhenu, along with her calf, to
Mahismati, Kartaviryarjuna’s capital.

PURPORT
The word havirdhanim is significant in this verse. Havirdhanim
refers to a cow required for supplying havis, or ghee, for the perfor-
mance of ritualistic ceremonies in sacrifices. In human life, one should
be trained to perform yajiias. As we are informed in Bhagavad-gita
(3.9), yajiarthat karmano ’nyatra loko ‘yam karma-bandhanah: if we
do not perform yajiia, we shall simply work very hard for sense grati-
fication like dogs and hogs. This is not civilization. A human being
should be trained to perform yajiia. Yajiiad bhavati parjanyah. If yajiias
are regularly performed, there will be proper rain from the sky, and
when there is regular rainfall, the land will be fertile and suitable for
producing all the necessities of life. Yajiia, therefore, is essential. For
performing yajiia, clarified butter is essential, and for clarified butter,
cow protection is essential. Therefore, if we neglect the Vedic way of
civilization, we shall certainly suffer. So-called scholars and philosophers
do not know the secret of success in life, and therefore they suffer in the
hands of prakrti, nature (prakrteh kriyamanani gunaih karmani
sarvasah). Nonetheless, although they are forced to suffer, they think

soldiers equipped with clubs, swords, arrows, rstis, Sataghnis,

viryarjuna sent seventeen full aksauhinis of soldiers to check
Parasurama. But Lord Parasurama alone killed all of them.

The word aksauhini refers to a military phalanx consisting of 21,870
chariots and elephants, 109,350 infantry soldiers and 65,610 horses. An

that a senamukha is three times what a patti is. Three senamukhas are
known as one gulma, three gulmas are called a gana, and three ganas are
called a vahini. Three vahinis have been referred to by the learned as a
prtana, three prtands equal one cami, and three camis equal one

In the beginning, when the army of the enemy was full of fighting
soldiers, elephants and horses, Lord Parasurama proceeded into their
midst at the speed of mind to kill them. When somewhat tired, he slowed

rushed to the battlefield.

might lop off the hoods of a serpent.

TRANSLATION
The duty of a brahmana is to culture the quality of forgiveness,
which is illuminating like the sun. The Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Hari, is pleased with those who are forgiving.
PURPORT
Different personalities become beautiful by possessing different
qualities. Cianakya Pandita says that the cuckoo bird, although very
black, is beautiful because of its sweet voice. Similarly, a woman becomes
beautiful by her chastity and faithfulness to her husband, and an ugly
person becomes beautiful when he becomes a learned scholar. In the
same way, brahmanas, ksatriyas, vaiSyas and Siidras become beautiful by
their qualities. Brahmanas are beautiful when they are forgiving,
ksatriyas when they are heroic and never retreat from fighting, vaisyas
when they enrich cultural activities and protect cows, and Sidras when
they are faithful in the discharge of duties pleasing to their masters.
Thus everyone becomes beautiful by his special qualities. And the special
quality of the brahmana, as described here, is forgiveness.

TRANSLATION
My dear son, killing a king who is an emperor is more severely
sinful than killing a brahmana. But now, if you become Krsna con-
scious and worship the holy places, you can atone for this great
sin.
PURPORT
One who fully surrenders to the Supreme Personality of Godhead is
freed from all sins (aham tvar sarva-papebhyo moksayisyami). From
the very day or moment he fully surrenders to Sri Krsna, even the most
sinful person is freed. Nonetheless, as an example, Jamadagni advised
his son Parasurama to worship the holy places. Because an ordinary per-
son cannot immediately surrender to the Supreme Personality of God-
head, he is advised to go from one holy place to another to find saintly
persons and thus gradually be released from sinful reactions.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Fifteenth
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled ‘“‘Parasurama, the Lord’s
Warrior Incarnation.”


--- Page 249 ---
CHAPTER SIXTEEN
Lord Parasurama Destroys
the World’s Ruling Class

When Jamadagni was killed by the sons of Kartaviryarjuna, as described
in this chapter, Parasurama rid the entire world of ksatriyas twenty-one
times. This chapter also describes the descendants of Visvamitra.

When Jamadagni’s wife, Renuka, went to bring water from the
Ganges and saw the King of the Gandharvas enjoying the company of
Apsaras, she was captivated, and she slightly desired to associate with
him. Because of this sinful desire, she was punished by her husband.
Para$urama killed his mother and brothers, but later, by dint of
the austerities of Jamadagni, they were revived. The sons of Karta-
viryarjuna, however, remembering the death of their father, wanted to
take revenge against Lord Parasurama, and therefore when Parasurama
was absent from the asrama, they killed Jamadagni, who was meditating
on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When Parasurama returned to
the asrama and saw his father killed, he was very sorry, and after asking
his brothers to take care of the dead body, he went out with determina-
tion to kill all the ksatriyas on the surface of the world. Taking up his
axe, he went to Mahismati-pura, the capital of Kartaviryarjuna, and
killed all of Kartaviryarjuna’s sons, whose blood became a great river.
Paradurama, however, was not satisfied with killing only the sons of
Kartaviryarjuna; later, when the ksatriyas became disturbing, he killed
them twenty-one times, so that there were no ksatriyas on the surface of
the earth. Thereafter, ParaSurama joined the head of his father to the
dead body and performed various sacrifices to please the Supreme Lord.
Thus Jamadagni got life again in his body, and later he was promoted to
the higher planetary system known as Saptarsi-mandala. Para$urima,
the son of Jamadagni, still lives in Mahendra-parvata. In the next
manvantara, he will become a preacher of Vedic knowledge.

In the dynasty of Gadhi, the most powerful Vi§vamitra took birth. By
dint of his austerity and penance, he became a brahmana. He had 101

247


--- Page 250 ---
248 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 16
sons, who were celebrated as the Madhucchandas. In the sacrificial arena
of HariScandra, the son of Ajigarta named Sunahsepha was meant to be
sacrificed, but by the mercy of the Prajapatis he was released.
Thereafter, he became Devarata in the dynasty of Gadhi. The fifty elder
sons of Viévamitra, however, did not accept Sunahsepha as their elder
brother, and therefore Viévamitra cursed them to become mlecchas, un-
faithful to the Vedic civilization. Visvamitra’s fifty-first son, along with
his younger brothers, then accepted Sunahéepha as their eldest brother,
and their father, Vi§vamitra, being satisfied, blessed them. Thus
Devarata was accepted in the dynasty of Kausika, and consequently there
are different divisions of that dynasty.

she returned she simply put the waterpot before him and stood
there with folded hands.

his order.

TRANSLATION
Jamadagni then ordered his youngest son, Parasurama, to kill
his brothers, who had disobeyed this order, and his mother, who


--- Page 254 ---

had mentally committed adultery. Lord Parasurama, knowing the
power of his father, who was practiced in meditation and austerity,
killed his mother and brothers immediately.
PURPORT
The word prabhava-jiiah is significant. Parasurama knew the prowess
of his father, and therefore he agreed to carry out his father’s order. He
thought that if he refused to carry out the order he would be cursed, but
if he carried it out his father would be pleased, and when his father was
pleased, Parasurama would ask the benediction of having his mother and
brothers brought back to life. ParaSurama was confident in this regard,
and therefore he agreed to kill his mother and brothers.

Jamadagni, the son of Satyavati, was very much pleased with

Parasurama replied, ‘Let my mother and brothers live again and
not remember having been killed by me. This is the benediction I
ask.”

TRANSLATION
My dear King Pariksit, the sons of Kartaviryarjuna, who were
defeated by the superior strength of Parasurama, never achieved
happiness, for they always remembered the killing of their father.
PURPORT
Jamadagni was certainly very powerful due to his austerities, but be-
cause of a slight offense by his poor wife, Renuka, he ordered that she be
killed. This certainly was a sinful act, and therefore Jamadagni was
killed by the sons of Kartaviryarjuna, as described herein. Lord
Parasurama was also infected by sin because of killing Kartaviryarjuna,
although this was not very offensive. Therefore, whether one be Karta-
viryarjuna, Lord Parasurama, Jamadagni or whoever one may be, one
must act very cautiously and sagaciously; otherwise one must suffer the
results of sinful activities. This is the lesson we receive from Vedic
literature.

they took the opportunity to kill him.

TRANSLATION
With the blood of the bodies of these sons, Lord Para§urama
created a ghastly river, which brought great fear to the kings who
had no respect for brahminical culture. Because the ksatriyas, the
men of power in government, were performing sinful activities,
Lord Parasurama, on the plea of retaliating for the murder of his
father, rid all the ksatriyas from the face of the earth twenty-one
times. Indeed, in the place known as Samanta-paiicaka he created
nine lakes filled with their blood.
PURPORT

Parasurama is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and his eternal
mission is paritranaya sadhitnam vinasaya ca duskrtam—to protect the
devotees and annihilate the miscreants. To kill all the sinful men is one
among the tasks of the incarnation of Godhead. Lord Parasurama killed
all the ksatriyas twenty-one times consecutively because they were dis-
obedient to the brahminical culture. That the ksatriyas had killed his
father was only a plea; the real fact is that because the ksatriyas, the rul-


--- Page 263 ---
Text 20] Lord Parasurama Destroys the Ruling Class 261
ing class, had become polluted, their position was inauspicious.
Brahminical culture is enjoined in the $dastra, especially in Bhagavad-
gita (catur-varnyam maya srstari guna-karma-vibhagasah). According
to the laws of nature, whether at the time of Parasurama or at the pres-
ent, if the government becomes irresponsible and sinful, not caring for
brahminical culture, there will certainly be an incarnation of God like
Parasurama to create a devastation by fire, famine, pestilence or some
other calamity. Whenever the government disrespects the supremacy of
the Personality of Godhead and fails to protect the institution of
varnasrama-dharma, it will certainly have to face such catastrophes as
formerly brought about by Lord Parasurama.

Thereafter, Parasurama joined his father’s head to the dead
body and placed the whole body and head upon kusa grass. By
offering sacrifices, he began to worship Lord Vasudeva, who is the
all-pervading Supersoul of all the demigods and of every living
entity.

TRANSLATION
Thereafter, having completed the ritualistic sacrificial
ceremonies, Lord Parasurama took the bath known as the
avabhrtha-snana. Standing on the bank of the great river Sarasvati,
cleared of all sins, Lord Parasurama appeared like the sun in a
clear, cloudless sky.
PURPORT
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (3.9), yajrarthat karmano ’nyatra loko
’yarii karma-bandhanah: “Work done as a sacrifice for Visnu has to be
performed, otherwise work binds one to this material world.” Karma-
bandhanah refers to the repeated acceptance of one material body after


--- Page 266 ---
264 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 16
another. The whole problem of life is this repetition of birth and death.
Therefore one is advised to work to perform yajiia meant for satisfying
Lord Visnu. Although Lord Parasurama was an incarnation of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, he had to account for sinful activities.
Anyone in this material world, however careful he may be, must commit
some sinful activities, even though he does not want to. For example, one
may trample many small ants and other insects while walking on the
street and kill many living beings unknowingly. Therefore the Vedic
principle of parica-yajra, five kinds of recommended sacrifice, is com-
pulsory. In this age of Kali, however, there is a great concession given to
people in general. YajAaih sankirtana-prayair yajanti hi sumedhasah:
we may worship Lord Caitanya, the hidden incarnation of Krsna. Krsna-
07077 tvisakrsnam: although He is Krsna Himself, He always chants
Hare Krsna and preaches Krsna consciousness. One is recommended to
worship this incarnation by chanting, the sarikirtana-yajia. The perfor-
mance of sarikirtana-yajia is a special concession for human society to
save people from being affected by known or unknown sinful activities.
We are surrounded by unlimited sins, and therefore it is compulsory that
one take to Krsna consciousness and chant the Hare Krsna maha-
mantra.

the seven sages in the group of seven stars.
PURPORT
The seven stars revolving around the polestar at the zenith are called
saptarsi-mandala. On these seven stars, which form the topmost part of
our planetary system, reside seven sages: KaSyapa, Atri, Vasistha,
Viévamitra, Gautama, Jamadagni and Bharadvaja. These seven stars are
seen every night, and they each make a complete orbit around the
polestar within twenty-four hours. Along with these seven stars, all the
others stars also orbit from east to west. The upper portion of the uni-
verse is called the north, and the lower portion is called the south. Even
in our ordinary dealings, while studying a map, we regard the upper
portion of the map as north.

Visvamitra, the son of Maharaja Gadhi, was as powerful as the
flames of fire. From the position of a ksatriya, he achieved the
position of a powerful brahmana by undergoing penances and
austerities.
PURPORT
Now, having narrated the history of Lord Parasurama, Sukadeva
Gosvami begins the history of Viévamitra. From the history of


--- Page 270 ---
268 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 16
Parasurama we can understand that although ParaSurama belonged to
the brahminical group, he circumstantially had to work as a ksatriya.
Later, after finishing his work as a ksatriya, he again became a
brahmana and returned to Mahendra-parvata. Similarly, we can see that
although Visvamitra was born in a ksatriya family, by austerities and
penances he achieved the position of a brahmana. These histories con-
firm the statements in $astra that a brahmana may become a ksatriya, a
ksatriya may become a brahmana or vaiSya, and a vaiSya may become a
brahmana, by achieving the required qualities. One’s status does not
depend upon birth. As confirmed in Srimad-Bhagavatam (7.11.35) by
Narada:
yasya yal laksanar proktari
puriiso varnabhivyarnijakam
yad anyatrapi driyeta
tat tenaiva vinirdiset
“If one shows the symptoms of being a brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya or
Sidra, even if he has appeared in a different class, he should be accepted
according to those symptoms of classification.” To know who is a
brahmana and who is a ksatriya, one must consider a man’s quality and
work. If all the unqualified Sidras become so-called brahmanas and
ksatriyas, social order will be impossible to maintain. Thus there will be
discrepancies, human society will turn into a society of animals, and the
situation all over the world will be hellish.

“Viévamitra had 101 sons. Fifty were older than Madhucchanda and fifty
younger.”

TRANSLATION
Sunahséepha’s father sold Sunahsepha to be sacrificed as a man-
animal in the yajfia of King HariScandra. When Sunah$epha was
brought into the sacrificial arena, he prayed to the demigods for
release and was released by their mercy.
PURPORT
Here is a description of Sunahéepha. When Hariscandra was to
sacrifice his son Rohita, Rohita arranged to save his own life by purchas-
ing Sunahsepha from Sunahéepha’s father to be sacrificed in the yajia.
Sunahsepha was sold to Maharaja Hariscandra because he was the middle
son, between the oldest and the youngest. It appears that the sacrifice of a
man as an animal in yajiia has been practiced for a very long time.

TRANSLATION
Although Sunahéepha was born in the Bhargava dynasty, he was
greatly advanced in spiritual life, and therefore the demigods in-
volved in the sacrifice protected him. Consequently he was also
celebrated as the descendant of Gadhi named Devarata.

Vi§vamitra, did not agree. Therefore ViSvamitra, being angry,
cursed them. ““May all of you bad sons become mlecchas,” he said,
“being opposed to the principles of Vedic culture.”
PURPORT

In Vedic literature there are names like mleccha and yavana. The
mlecchas are understood to be those who do not follow the Vedic prin-
ciples. In former days, the mlecchas were fewer, and Vis§vamitra Muni
cursed his sons to become mlecchas. But in the present age, Kali-yuga,
there is no need of cursing, for people are automatically mlecchas. This is
only the beginning of Kali-yuga, but at the end of Kali-yuga the entire
population will consist of mlecchas because no one will follow the Vedic
principles. At that time the incarnation Kalki will appear. Mleccha-
nivaha-nidhane kalayasi kara-balam. He will kill all the mlecchas
indiscriminately with his sword.

TRANSLATION
Thus the younger Madhucchandas accepted Sunahéepha as their
eldest brother and told him, “We shall follow your orders.”
Visvamitra then said to his obedient sons, ‘Because you have ac-
cepted Sunahsepha as your eldest brother, I am very satisfied. By
accepting my order, you have made me a father of worthy sons,
and therefore I bless all of you to become the fathers of sons also.”
PURPORT
_ Of the one hundred sons, half disobeyed Visvamitra by not accepting
SunahsSepha as their eldest brother, but the other half accepted his order.


--- Page 276 ---
274 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 16
Therefore the father blessed the obedient sons to become the fathers of
sons. Otherwise they too would have been cursed to be sonless mlecchas.

Visvamitra cursed some of his sons and blessed the others, and
he also adopted a son. Thus there were varieties in the Kausika
dynasty, but among all the sons, Devarata was considered the
eldest.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Sixteenth
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “Lord Parasurama

The Author

His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada appeared in
this world in 1896 in Calcutta, India. He first met his spiritual master,
Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami, in Calcutta in 1922. Bhakti-
siddhanta Sarasvati, a prominent devotional scholar and the founder of
sixty-four Gaudiya Mathas (Vedic institutes), liked this educated young
man and convinced him to dedicate his life to teaching Vedic knowledge.
Srila Prabhupada became his student, and eleven years later (1933) at
Allahabad he became his formally initiated disciple.

At their first meeting, in 1922, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati
Thakura requested Srila Prabhupada to broadcast Vedic knowledge
through the English language. In the years that followed, Srila Prabhu-
pada wrote a commentary on the Bhagavad-gita, assisted the Gaudiya
Matha in its work and, in 1944, without assistance, started an English
fortnightly magazine, edited it, typed the manuscripts and checked the
galley proofs. He even distributed the individual copies freely and strug-
gled to maintain the publication. Once begun, the magazine never
stopped; it is now being continued by his disciples in the West.

Recognizing Srila Prabhupada’s philosophical learning and devotion,
the Gaudiya Vaisnava Society honored him in 1947 with the title
“Bhaktivedanta.”” In 1950, at the age of fifty-four, Srila Prabhupada
retired from married life, and four years later he adopted the
vanaprastha (retired) order to devote more time to his studies and writ-
ing. Srila Prabhupada traveled to the holy city of Vrndavana, where he
lived in very humble circumstances in the historic medieval temple of
Radha-Damodara. There he engaged for several years in deep study and
writing. He accepted the renounced order of life (sannyasa) in 1959. At
Radha-Damodara, Srila Prabhupada began work on his life’s master-
piece: a multivolume translation and commentary on the eighteen thou-
sand verse Srimad-Bhagavatam (Bhagavata Purana). He also wrote
Easy Journey to Other Planets.

After publishing three volumes of Bhagavatam, Srila Prabhupada
came to the United States, in 1965, to fulfill the mission of his spiritual
master. Since that time, His Divine Grace has written over forty volumes
of authoritative translations, commentaries and summary studies of the
philosophical and religious classics of India.

In 1965, when he first arrived by freighter in New York City, Srila
Prabhupada was practically penniless. It was after almost a year of great
difficulty that he established the International Society for Krishna Con-
sciousness in July of 1966. Under his careful guidance, the Society has
grown within a decade to a worldwide confederation of almost one
hundred asramas, schools, temples, institutes and farm communities.

In 1968, Srila Prabhupada created New Vrndavana, an experimental
Vedic community in the hills of West Virginia. Inspired by the success of
New Vrndavana, now a thriving farm community of more than one thou-
sand acres, his students have since founded several similar communities
in the United States and abroad.

In 1972, His Divine Grace introduced the Vedic system of primary and
secondary education in the West by founding the Gurukula school in
Dallas, Texas. The school began with 3 children in 1972, and by the
beginning of 1975 the enrollment had grown to 150.

Srila Prabhupada has also inspired the construction of a large inter-
national center at Sridhama Mayapur in West Bengal, India, which is also
the site for a planned Institute of Vedic Studies. A similar project is the
magnificent Krsna-Balarama Temple and International Guest House in
Vrndiavana, India. These are centers where Westerners can live to gain
firsthand experience of Vedic culture.

Srila Prabhupada’s most significant contribution, however, is his
books. Highly respected by the academic community for their authori-
tativeness, depth and clarity, they are used as standard textbooks in
numerous college courses. His writings have been translated into eleven
languages. The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, established in 1972 ex-
clusively to publish the works of His Divine Grace, has thus become the
world’s largest publisher of books in the field of Indian religion and phi-
losophy. Its latest project is the publishing of Srila Prabhupada’s most
recent work: a seventeen-volume translation and commentary —com-
pleted by Srila Prabhupiada in only eighteen months—on the Bengali
religious classic Sri Caitanya-caritamrta. i

In the past ten years, in spite of his advanced age, Srila Prabhupada
has circled the globe twelve times on lecture tours that have taken him to
six continents. In spite of such a vigorous schedule, Srila Prabhupada
continues to write prolifically. His writings constitute a veritable library
of Vedic philosophy, religion, literature and culture.

long (a, i, 8, e, ai, 0, au), or whose short vowel is followed by more
than one consonant (including anusvira and visarga). Aspirated
consonants (such as kha and gha) count as only single consonants.
