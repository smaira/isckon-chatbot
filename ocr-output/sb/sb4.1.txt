TRANSLATION
Sri Maitreya said: Svayambhuva Manu begot three daughters in his wife
Satarupa, and their names were Akiiti, Devahiiti and Prasiiti.
PURPORT
First of all let us offer our respectful obeisances unto our spiritual
master, Om Visnupada Sri Srimad Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami
Prabhupada, by whose order 1 am engaged in this herculean task of writing
commentary on the Srimad-Bhagavatam as the Bhaktivedanta purports.
By his grace we have finished three cantos already, and we are just trying
1


--- Page 2 ---
2 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 1
to begin the Fourth Canto. By his divine grace let us offer our respectful
obeisances unto Lord Caitanya, who began this Krsna consciousness
movement of Bhagavata-dharma 500 years ago, and through His grace let
us offer our obeisances to the six Gosvamis, and then let us offer our
obeisances to Radha and Krsna, the spiritual couple who enjoy eternally
in Vrndavana with Their cowherd boys and damsels in Vrajabhiimi. Let
us also offer our respectful obeisances to all the devotees and eternal
servitors of the Supreme Lord.

In this Fourth Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam there are thirty-one
chapters, and all these chapters describe the secondary creation by Brahma
and the Manus. The real creation is done by the Supreme Lord Himself
by agitating His material energy, and then, by His order, Brahma, the
first living creature in the universe, attempts to create the different
planetary systems and their inhabitants, expanding the population through
his progeny, like Manu and other progenitors of living entities, who work
perpetually under the order of the Supreme Lord. In the First Chapter of
this Fourth Canto there are descriptions of the three daughters of
Svayambhuva Manu and their descendants. The next six chapters describe
the sacrifice performed by King Daksa and how it was spoiled. Thereafter
the activities of Maharaja Dhruva are described in five chapters. Then, in
eleven chapters, the activities of King Prthu are described, and the next
eight chapters are devoted to the activities of the Pracetas Kihgs. As de-
scribed in the first verse of this chapter, Svayambhuva Manu had three
daughters, named Akuti, Devahiiti and Prasiiti..Of these three daughters, one
daughter, Devahiiti, has already been described, along with her husband,
Kardama Muni, and her son, Kapila Muni. In this chapter the descendants
of the first daughter, Akiiti, will specifically be described. Svayambhuva
Manu is the son of Brahma. Brahma had many other sons, but Manu’s
name is specifically mentioned first because he was a great devotee of the
Lord. In this verse there is also the word ca, indicating that besides the
three daughters mentioned, Svayambhuva Manu also had two sons.

akatim—Akuti; rucaye—unto the great sage Ruci; pradat—handed over;
api—although; bhratrmatim—daughter having a brother; nrpah—the King;
putrika—get the resultant son; dharmam~—religious rites; asritya— taking
shelter; sataripa—the wife of Svayambhuva Manu; anumoditah—being
sanctioned.

TRANSLATION

Akiiti had two brothers, but in spite of her brothers, King Svayambhuva
Manu handed her over to Prajapati Ruci on the condition that the son
born of her be returned to him as his son. This he did in consultation with
his wife, Satariipa.

PURPORT

Sometimes a sonless person offers his daughter to a husband on the
condition that his grandson be returned to him to be adopted as his son
and inherit his property. This is called putrika-dharma, which means that
by execution of religious rituals one gets a son, although he is sonless by
his own wife. But here we see extraordinary behavior in Manu, for
in spite of his having two sons, he handed over his first daughter to
Prajapati Ruci on the condition that the son born of his daughter be
returned to him as his son. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakur comments
in this connection that King Manu knew that the Supreme Personality of
Godhead would take birth in the womb of Akiti; therefore, in spite of
having two sons, he wanted the particular son born of Akiiti because he
was ambitious to have the Supreme Personality of Godhead appear as his
son and grandson. Manu is the lawgiver of mankind, and since he
personally executed the putrika-dharma, it is to be accepted that such a
system can be adopted by mankind also. Thus, even though one has a son,
if he wants to have a particular son from his daughter, he can give his
daughter in charity on that condition. That is the opinion of Srila Jiva
Gosvami.

prajapatih—one who is entrusted to beget children: sah—he; bhagavan—
the most opulent; rucih—the great sage Ruci; tasyam—in her; ajijanat—gave
birth; mithunam—couple; brahma-varcasvi—very much spiritually powerful;
paramepa—with great strength; samadhina—in trance.

TRANSLATION

Ruci, who was very powerful in his brahminical qualifications and was
appointed one of the progenitors of the living entities, begot one son and
one daughter by his wife, Akiti.

PURPORT

The word brahma-varcasvi is very significant. Ruci was a brahmapa, and
he executed the brahminical duties very rigidly. As stated in Bhagavad-
gita, the brahminical qualifications are control of the senses, control of the
mind, cleanliness within and without, development of spiritual and
material knowledge, simplicity, truthfulness, faith in the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, etc. There are many qualities which indicate a
brahminical personality, and it is understood that Ruci followed all the
brahminical principles rigidly. Therefore he is specifically mentioned as
brahma-varcasvi. One who is born of a brahmana father but does not act
as a brahmana is called, in Vedic language, a brahma-bandhu, and is
calculated to be on the level of §iidras and women. Thus in the Bhagavatam
we find that Mahabharata was specifically compiled by Vyasadeva for
stri-siidra-brahma-bandhu. Stri means women, siidra means the lower class
of civilized human society, and brahma-bandhu means persons who are
born in the families of brahmapas but do not follow the rules and
regulations carefully. All of these three classes are called less intelligent;
they have no access to the study of the 16005, which are specifically
meant for persons who have acquired the brahminical qualifications. This
restriction is not based upon any sectarian distinction but upon qualifica-
tion. The Vedic literatures cannot be understood unless one has developed
the brahminical qualifications. It is regrettable, therefore, that persons
who have no brahminical qualifications and have never been trained under
a bona fide spiritual master nevertheless comment on Vedic literatures
like the Srimad-Bhagavatam and other Puranas, for they cannot deliver
their real message. Ruci was considered a first-class brahmapa; therefore
he is mentioned here as brahma-varcasvi, one who has full prowess in
brahminical strength.

TRANSLATION
Of the two children born of Akuti, the male child was directly an
incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and His name was
Yajia, which is another name of Lord Visnu. The female child was a
partial incarnation of Laksmi, the goddess of fortune, the eternal consort
of Lord Visnu.
PURPORT
Laksmi, the goddess of fortune, is the eternal consort of Lord Visnu.
Here it is stated that both the Lord and Laksmi, who are eternal consorts,
appeared from Akiiti simultaneously. Both the Lord and His consort are
beyond this material creation, as confirmed by many authorities
(narayanah paro ‘vyaktat); therefore their eternal relationship cannot be
changed, and Yajfia, the boy born of Akitti, later on married the goddess
of fortune.

aninye—brought to; sva-grham—home; putryah—born of the daughter;
putram—the son; vitatarocisam—very powerful; svayambhuvah—the Manu
named Svayambhuva; muda—being very pleased; yuktah—with; rucih—the
great sage Ruci; jagraha—kept; daksinam—the daughter named Daksina.

TRANSLATION

Svayambhuva Manu very gladly brought home the boy named Yajiia,
who was so beautiful, and Ruci, his son-in-law, kept with him the daughter,
Daksina.

PURPORT

Svayambhuva Manu was very glad to see that his daughter, Akiiti, had
given birth to both a boy and girl. He was afraid that he would take one
son and that because of this his son-in-law, Ruci, might be sorry. Thus
when he heard that a daughter was born along with the boy, he was very
glad. Ruci, according to his promise, returned his male child to
Svayambhuva Manu and decided to keep the daughter, whose name was
Daksina. One of Lord Visnu’s names is Yajfia because He is the master of
the Vedas. The name के शुवे comes from yajusam patih; in the Yajur-veda
there are different ritualistic prescriptions for performing yajiias, and the
beneficiary of all such yajiias is the Supreme Lord, Visnu. Therefore it is
stated in Bhagavad-gita, yajiiarthat karmanah : one should act, but one should
perform his prescribed duties only for the sake of Yajfia or Visnu. If one
does not act for the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
or if one does not perform devotional service, then there will be reactions
to all his activities. It does not matter if the reaction is good or bad; if our
activities are not dovetailed with the desire of the Supreme Lord, or if we
do not act in Krsna consciousness, then we shall be responsible for the
results of all our activities. There is always a reaction to every kind of
action, but if actions are performed for Y ajfia, there is no reaction. Thus
if one acts for Yajiia, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one is not
entangled in the material condition, for it is mentioned in the Vedas and
also in Bhagavad-gita that the Vedas and the Vedic rituals are all meant for
understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna. From the very
beginning one should try to act in Krsna consciousness; that will free one
from the reactions of material activities.

tam—her; kamayanam—desiring; bhagavan—the Lord; uvaha—married;
yajusam—of all sacrifices; patih—master; tustayam—in His wife who was
very much pleased; tosam—greal pleasure; dpannah—having obtained;
ajanayat—gave birth; dvadasa—twelve; atmajan—sons.

TRANSLATION

The Lord of the ritualistic performance of yajiia later on married
Daksina, who was anxious to have the Personality of Godhead as her
husband, and in this wife the Lord was also very much pleased to beget
twelve children.

PURPORT

An ideal husband and wife are generally called Laksmi-Narayana to
compare them to the Lord and the goddess of fortune, for it is significant
that Laksmi-Narayana are forever happy as husband and wife. A wife
should always remain satisfied with her husband, and a husband should
always remain satisfied with his wife. In the Canakya-sloka, the moral
instructions of Canakya Pandit, it is said that if a husband and wife are
always satisfied with one another, then the goddess of fortune automati-
cally comes. In other words, where there is no disagreement between
husband and wife there is all material opulence present, and good children
are born. Generally, according to Vedic civilization, the wife is trained to
be satisfied in all conditions, and the husband, according to Vedic instruc-
tion, is required to please the wife with sufficient food, ornaments and
clothing. Then, if they are satisfied with their mutual dealings, good
children are born. In this way the entire world can become peaceful, but
unfortunately in this age of Kali there are no ideal husbands and wives;
therefore unwanted children are produced, and there is no peace and
prosperity in the present-day world.

PURPORT
During the life of Svayambhuva Manu, six kinds of living entities were
generated from the demigods known as the tugitas, from the sages headed
by Marici, and from descendants of Yajfia, King of the demigods, and all
of them expanded their progeny to observe the order of the Lord to fill
the universe with living entities. These six kinds of living entities are
known as manus, devas, manu-putras, ৫182008৫705, suresvaras and 1915.
Yajnia, being the incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
became the leader of the demigods, Indra.

TRANSLATION

Anasiya, the wife of Atri Muni, gave birth to three very famous sons,
Soma, Dattatreya and Durvasa, who were partial representations of Lord
Visnu, Lord Siva and Lord Brahmi. Soma was a partial representation of
Lord Brahma, Dattatreya was a partial representation of Lord Visnu, and
Durvasa was a partial representation of Lord Siva.

PURPORT

In this verse we find the words atma-isa-brahma-sambhavan. Atma means
the Supersoul, or Visnu, 14৫ means Lord Siva, and brahma means the four-
headed Lord Brahma. The three sons born of Anasiiya— Dattatreya,
Durvasa and Soma—were born as partial representations of these three
demigods. Atma is not in the category of the demigods or living entities
because He is Vignu; therefore He is described as vibhinnarmsa-bhutanam. The
Supersoul or Vignu is the seed-giving father of all living entities, including
Brahma and Lord Siva. Another meaning of the word atma may be
accepted in this way: the principle who is the Supersoul in every atma, or,
one may say, the soul of everyone, became manifested as Dattatreya,
because the word ৫778৫, part and parcel, is used here.

In Bhagavad-gita the individual souls are also described as parts of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead or Supersoul, so why not accept that
Dattatreya is one of those parts? Lord Siva and Lord Brahma are also
described here as parts, so why not accept all of them as ordinary
individual souls? The answer is that the manifestations of Visnu and
those of the ordinary living entities are certainly all parts and parcels of
the Supreme Lord, and no one is equal to Him, but among the parts and
parcels there are different categories. In the कल्यान Purapa it is nicely
explained that some of the parts are svarmsa, and some are vibhinnarmsa.
Vibhinnarmsa parts are called jivas, and svamsa parts are in the Visnu
category. In the jiva category, the vibhinnarmsa parts and parcels, there are
also gradations. That is explained in the Vispu Purana, where it is clearly
stated that the individual parts and parcels who can travel to any part of
the Lord’s creation are called sarva-gata and are suffering the pangs of
material existence. They are subject to be freed from the coverings of
ignorance under material existence according to different levels of work


--- Page 14 ---
14 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 1
and under different influences of the modes of material nature. For
example, the sufferings of jivas who are situated in the mode of goodness
are less than those of jivas situated in the mode of ignorance. Pure Krsna
consciousness is the birthright of all living entities because every living
entity is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. The consciousness of the
Lord is also in the part and parcel, and according to the proportion to
which that consciousness is cleared of material dirt, the living entities are
differently situated. In the Veddntae-siitra the living entities of different
gradations are compared to candles or lamps with different candle power.
For example, some electric bulbs have the power of one thousand candles,
some have the power of 500 candles, some the power of 100 candles, some
fifty candles, etc., but all electric bulbs have light. Light is present in every
bulb, but the gradations of light are different. Similarly, there are
gradations of Brahman. The Visnu svariisa expansions of the Supreme Lord
in different Vignu forms are like lamps, Lord Siva is also like a lamp, and
the supreme candle power or the 100 percent light is Krsna. The Visnu-
tattva has ninety-four percent, the Siva-tattva has eighty-four percent,
Lord Brahma has seventy-eight percent, and the living entities are also
like Brahma, but in the conditioned state their power is still more dim.
There are gradations of Brahman, and no one can deny this fact. There-
fore the words atmesa-brahma-sam bhavin indicate that Dattatreya is
directly part and parcel of Visnu, whereas Durvasa and Soma are parts and
parcels of Lord Siva and Lord Brahma.

TRANSLATION
After hearing this, Vidura inquired from Maitreya: My dear master, how
is it that the three deities Brahma, Visnu and Siva, who are the creator,
maintainer and destroyer of the whole creation, became the offspring of
the wife of Atri Muni?
PURPORT
The inquisitiveness of Vidura was quite fitting, for he understood that
when the Supersoul, Lord Brahma and Lord Siva all appeared through the
person of Anastiya, the wife of Atri Muni, there must have been some
great purpose. Otherwise why should they appear in such a way?

TRANSLATION

He was thinking: May the Lord of the universe, of whom I have taken

shelter, kindly be pleased to offer me a son exactly like Him.
PURPORT

It appears that the great sage Atri Muni had no specific idea of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Of course he must have been conversant
with the Vedic information that there is the Supreme Personality of God-
head who is the creator of the universe, from whom everything emanated,
who maintains this created manifestation, and in whom the entire manifes-
tation is conserved after dissolution. Yato va imani bhutani. The Vedic
mantras give us information of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, so he
concentrated his mind upon that Supreme Personality of Godhead, even
without knowing His name, just to beg from Him a child exactly on His
level. This kind of devotional service, in which knowledge of God’s name
is lacking, is also described in Bhagavad-gita where the Lord says that there
are four kinds of men with backgrounds of pious activities who come
to Him asking what they need. Atri Muni wanted a son exactly like the
Lord, and therefore he is not supposed to be a pure devotee because he
had a desire to be fulfilled, and that desire was material. Although he
wanted a son exactly like the Supreme Personality of Godhead, still it


--- Page 18 ---
18 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 1
was material desire because he did not want the Personality of Godhead
Himself, but only a child exactly like Him. If he had desired the Supreme
Personality of Godhead as his child he would have been completely free
of material desires because he would have wanted the Supreme Absolute
Truth, but because he wanted a similar child, that was material. Thus Atri
Muni cannot be counted among the pure devotees.

TRANSLATION
While Atri Muni was engaged in these severe austerities, a blazing fire
came out of his head due to his breathing exercise, and that fire was seen
by the three principal deities of the three worlds.
PURPORT
According to Srila Jiva Gosvami, the fire of pranayama is mental satis-
faction, and that was perceived by the Supersoul, Visnu, and thereby Lord
Brahma and Siva also perceived it. By his breathing exercise Atri Muni
concentrated on the Supersoul, or the Lord of the universe. As confirmed
in Bhagavad-gita, the Lord of the universe is Vasudeva (vasudevah sarvam
iti), and, by the direction of Vasudeva, Lord Brahma and Lord Siva work.
Therefore, on the direction of Vasudeva, both Lord Brahma and Lord
Siva perceived the severe penance adopted by Atri Muni, and thus they
were pleased to come down, as stated in the next verse.

thus they entered the asrama of the great sage, who had become so famous
by his austerities.
PURPORT
It is advised in the Vedic literatures that one should take shelter of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the Lord of the universe and who
is the master of creation, maintenance and dissolution. He is known as the
Supersoul, and when one worships the Supersoul, all other deities, such
as Brahma and Siva, appear with Lord Visnu because they are directed by
the Supersoul.

Thereafter he began to offer prayers to the three deities, who were
seated on different carriers-a bull, a swan and Garuda—and who held in
their hands a drum, [तप grass and a discus. The sage offered them his
respects by falling down like a stick.
PURPORT
Danpda means a long rod, and vat means like. Before a superior, one has
to fall down on the ground just like a stick, and this sort of offering of
respect is called dandavat. Atri Rsi offered his respect to the three deities
in that way. They were identified by their different carriers and different

symbolic representations. In that connection it is stated here that Lord
Vignu was sitting on Garuda, a big aquiline bird, and was carrying in His
hand a disc, Brahma was sitting on a swan and had in his hand kusa grass,
and Lord Siva was sitting on a bull and was carrying in his hand a small
drum called a damaru. Atri Rsi recognized them by their symbolic repre-
sentations and different carriers, and thus he offered them prayers and
respects.

towards him. His eyes were dazzled by the effulgence of their bodies, and
therefore he closed his eyes for the time being.
PURPORT
Since the deities were smiling, he could understand that they were
pleased with him. Their glaring bodily effulgences were intolerable to his
cyes, so he closed them for the time being.

But since his heart was already attracted by the deities, somehow or

began to offer prayers to the predominating deities of the universe. The
great sage Atri said: O Lord Brahma, Lord Visnu and Lord Siva, you have
divided yourself into three bodies by accepting the three modes of materi-
al nature, as you do in every millennium for the creation, maintenance and
dissolution of the cosmic manifestation. 1 offer my respectful obeisances
unto all of you and beg to inquire whom of you three I have called by my
prayer.


--- Page 23 ---
Text 28] Genealogical Table of the Daughters of Manu 23
PURPORT

Atri Rsi called for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, jagadisvara, the
Lord of the universe. The Lord must exist before the creation, otherwise
how could He be its Lord? If someone constructs a big building, this indi-
cates that he must have existed before the building was constructed. There-
fore the Supreme Lord, the creator of the universe, must be transcenden-
tal to the material modes of nature. But it is known that Visnu takes
charge of the mode of goodness, Brahma takes charge of the mode of
passion, and Lord Siva takes charge of the mode of ignorance. Therefore
Atri Muni said, “That jagadisvara, the Lord of the universe, must be one of
you, but since three of you have appeared, I cannot recognize whom 1
have called. You are all so kind. Please let me know who is actually
jagadisvara, the Lord of the universe.” In fact Atri Rsi was doubtful
about the constitutional position of the Supreme Lord Vignu, but he was
quite certain that the Lord of the universe cannot be one of the creatures
created by maya. His very inquiry about whom he called for indicates
that he was in doubt about the constitutional position of the Lord.
Therefore he prayed to all three, “Kindly let me know who is the
transcendental Lord of the universe.” He was, of course, certain that not
all of them could be the Lord, but the Lord of the universe was one of the
three.

Atri Muni was confidently aware that the Supreme Personality of God-

He was surprised, therefore, that three of them appeared.

TRANSLATION

The three deities told Atri Muni: Dear brahmana, you are perfect
in your determination, so as you have decided, so it will happen; it will
not happen otherwise. We are all the same person upon whom you were
meditating, and we have all come to you.

PURPORT

Atri Muni unspecifically thought of the Personality of Godhead, the
Lord of the universe, although he had no clear idea of the Lord of the
universe nor of His specific form. Maha-Visnu, from whose breathing
millions of universes emanate and into whom they are again withdrawn,
may be accepted as the Lord of the universe. Garbhodakasayi Visnu,
from whose abdomen sprouted the lotus flower which is the birthplace of
Brahma, can also be considered the Lord of the universe. Similarly,
Ksirodakasayi Visnu, who is the Supersoul of all living entities, can also be
considered the Lord of the universe. Then, under the order of
KsirodakasayT Visnu, the Visnu form within this universe, Lord Brahma
and Lord Siva can also be accepted as the lords of the universe. Visnu is the
Lord of the universe because He is its maintainer.

Similarly Brahma creates the different planetary systems and the popu-
lation. so he also can be considered the Lord of the universe. Or Lord Siva,
who is ultimately the destroyer of the universe, also can be considered its
lord. Therefore, since Atri Muni did not specifically mention whom he
wanted, all three—Brahma, Visnu and Lord Siva—came before him. They
said, “Since you were thinking of having a son exactly like the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, the Lord of the universe, your determination will
be fulfilled.” In other words, one’s determination is fulfilled according to


--- Page 26 ---
26 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 1
the strength of one’s devotion. As stated in Bhagavad-gita: yanti deva-
vrata devan pitrn yanti pitr-vratah. If one is attached to a particular
demigod, he is promoted to the abode of that demigod; if one is attached
to the pitrs or forefathers he is promoted to their planet; and similarly if
one is attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, he is pro-
moted to the abode of Lord Krsna. Atri Muni actually had no clear con-
ception of the Lord of the universe; therefore the three presiding deities
who are actually the lords of the universe in the three departments of the
modes of nature all came before him. Now, according to the strength of his
determination for a son, his desire would be fulfilled by the grace of the
Lord.

The demigods said: Let us offer our respectful obeisances unto the

clouds are situated in space, and who has now appeared in the form of
Nara-Narayana Rsi in the house of Dharma.
PURPORT
The universal form of the Lord is in the cosmic manifestation, which
is an exhibition of the external energy of the Supreme Personality of


--- Page 40 ---
40 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 1
Godhead. In space there are innumerable varieties of planets and also the
air, and in the air there are variously colored clouds, and sometimes we
see airplanes running from one place to another. Thus the entire cosmic
manifestation is full of variety, but actually that variety is a manifestation
of the external energy of the Supreme Lord, and that energy is situated in
Him. Now the Lord Himself, after manifesting His energy, appeared within
the creation of His energy, which is simultaneously one with and different
from Himself, and therefore the demigods offered their respects to the
Supreme Personality of Godhead who manifests Ilimself in such varieties.
There are some philosophers, called nondualists, who, because of their
impersonal conception, think that the varieties are false. In this verse it is
specifically stated, yo mayaya viracitam. This indicates that the varieties
are a manifestation of the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Thus because the energy is nondifferent from the Godhead, the varieties
are also factual. The material varieties may be temporary, but they are not
false. They are a reflection of the spiritual varieties. Here the word
praticaksandya, “there are varieties,” announces the glories of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead who appeared as Nara-Narayana Rsi and who is
the origin of all varieties of material nature.

TRANSLATION

Let that Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is understood by truly
authorized Vedic literature and who has created peace and prosperity to
destroy all calamities of the created world, be kind enough to bestow His
glance upon the demigods. His merciful glance can supersede the beauty
of the spotless lotus flower which is the home of the goddess of fortune.

PURPORT

The Supreme Personality of Godhead who is the origin of the cosmic
manifestation is covered by the wonderful activities of material nature,
just as outer space or the illumination of the sun and moon are sometimes
covered by clouds or dust. It is very difficult to find the origin of the
cosmic manifestation; therefore material scientists conclude that nature
is the ultimate cause of all manifestations. But from $astra, or authentic
literature like Bhagavad-gita and other Vedic scriptures, we understand
that behind this wonderful cosmic manifestation is the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, and in order to maintain the regular procedures of the cosmic
manifestation and to be visible to the eyes of persons who are in the
mode of goodness, the Lord appears. He is the cause of the creation and
dissolution of the cosmic manifestatipn. The demigods therefore prayed
for His merciful glance upon them in order to be blessed.

Narayana is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and Nara is a part of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead Narayana. Thus the energy and the
energetic together are the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Maitreya
informed Vidura that Nara, the portion of Narayana, had appeared in the
family of the Kurus and that Narayana, the plenary expansion of Krsna,
had come as Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, with the purpose
of delivering the suffering humanity from the pangs of material burdens.

were all daughters of Daksa, Maitreya now describes the fourteenth

the three sons of Agni and Svaha, namely Pavaka, Pavamana, and Suci,

TRANSLATION

The reason is that Sati’s father, Daksa, used to chastise Lord Siva in
spite of Siva’s faultlessness. Therefore, before attaining a mature age,
Sati gave up her body by dint of yogic mystic power.

PURPORT

Lord Siva, being the head of all mystic yogis, never even constructed a
home for his residence. Sati was the daughter of a great king, Daksa, and
because his youngest daughter, Sati, selected as her husband Lord Siva,
King Daksa was not very much satisfied with her. Therefore whenever she
met her father, he unnecessarily chastised her husband, although Lord Siva
was faultless. Because of this, before attaining a mature age Sati gave up
the body given by her father, Daksa, and therefore she could not produce
a child.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fourth Canto, First
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “Genealogical Table of the
Daughters of Manu.”

TRANSLATION
Vidura inquired: Why was Daksa, who was so affectionate towards his
daughter, so envious of Lord Siva, who is the best among the gentle? Why
did he neglect his daughter Sati?
PURPORT
In the Second Chapter of the Fourth Canto, the cause of the dissension
between Lord Siva and Daksa, which was due to a great sacrifice arranged
by Daksa for the pacification of the entire universe, is explained. Lord
Siva is described here as the best of the gentle because he is not envious
of anyone, he is equal to all living entities, and all other good qualities
are present in his personality. Siva means all-auspicious. No one can be
49

an enemy of Lord Siva’s, for he is so peaceful and renounced that he does
not even construct a house for his residence, but lives underneath a tree,
always detached from all worldly things. The personality of Lord Siva
symbolizes the best of gentleness. Why, then, was Daksa, who offered his
beloved daughter to such a gentle personality, so intensely inimical towards
Lord Siva that Sati, the daughter of Daksa and wife of Lord Siva, gave up
her body?

TRANSLATION

Lord Siva, the spiritual master of the entire world, is free from enmity,
is a peaceful personality, and is always satisfied in himself. He is the great-
est among the demigods. How is it possible that Daksa could be inimical
towards such an auspicious personality?

PURPORT

Lord Siva is described here as caracara-guru, the spiritual master of all
animate and inanimate objects. He is sometimes known as Bhiitanatha,
which means the worshipable deity of the dull-headed. Bhiita is also
sometimes taken to indicate the ghosts. Lord Siva takes charge of re-
forming persons who are ghosts and demons, not to speak of others, who
are godly; therefore heis the spiritual master of everyone, both the dull and
demoniac and the highly learned Vaignavas. It is also stated, vaisnavanari
yathd sambhuh. Sambhu, Lord Siva, is the greatest of all Vaigsnavas. On
one hand he is the worshipable object of the dull demons, and on the


--- Page 50 ---
Text 4] Daksa Curses Lord Siva 51
other he is the best of all Vaisnavas, or devotees, and he has a sampradaya
called the Rudra-sampradaya. Even if he is an enemy or is sometimes
angry, such a personality cannot be the object of envy, so Vidura, in
astonishment, asked why he was taken as such, especially by Daksa. Daksa
is also not an ordinary person. He is a Prajapati in charge of fathering
population, and all his daughters are highly elevated, especially Sali. Sati
means the most chaste. Whenever there is consideration of chastity, Sati,
this wife of Lord Siva and daughter of Daksa, is considered first. Vidura
was astonished that there could possibly be so much enmity between
Daksa, who was such a great man, the father of Sati, and Lord Siva, the
spiritual master of everyone, that the most chaste goddess Sati gave up
her body in that quarrel.

PURPORT
Upon being asked by Vidura, the sage Maitreya began to explain the
cause of the misunderstanding between Lord Siva and Daksa, because of
which the goddess Sati gave up her body. Thus begins the history of a
great sacrifice performed by the leaders of the universal creation, namely
Marici, Daksa and Vasistha. These great personalities arranged for a great
sacrifice, for which demigods like Indra and the fire-gods assembled with
their followers. Lord Brahma and Lord Siva were also present.

Before taking his seat, however, Daksa was very much offended to see
Lord Siva sitting there and not showing any respect to him. At that time
he became greatly angry, and, his eyes glowing, he began to speak very
strongly against him.
PURPORT
Lord Siva, being the son-in-law of Baksa, was expected to show his
father-in-law respect by standing with the others, but because Lord
Brahma and Lord Siva are the principal demigods, their positions were
greater than Daksga’s. Daksa, however, could not tolerate this, and he took
it as an insult by his son-in-law. Previously, also, he was not very much
satisfied with Lord Siva because Siva looked very poor and was niggardly
in dress.

TRANSLATION
All sages, brahmanas and fire-gods present here, please hear me with
attention, for I am speaking about the manners of gentle persons. I am
not speaking out of ignorance or envy.
PURPORT
In speaking against Lord Siva, Daksa tried to pacify the assembly by
presenting in a very tactful way that he was going to speak about the
manners of gentle persons, although naturally this might affect some
unmannerly upstarts and the assembly might be unhappy because they
did not want even unmannerly persons to be offended. In other words, he
was in complete knowledge that he was speaking against Lord Siva in
spite of Siva’s spotless character. As far as envy is concerned, from the
very beginning he was envious of Lord Siva; therefore he could not
distinguish his own particular envy. Although he spoke like a man in
ignorance, he wanted to cover his statements by saying that he was not
speaking for impudent and envious reasons.

--- Page 55 ---
56 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 2
TRANSLATION

Siva has spoiled the name and fame of the governors of the universe
and has polluted the path of gentle manners. Because he is shameless, he
does not know how to act.

PURPORT

Daksa wanted to impress upon the minds of all the great sages assembled
in that meeting that va, being one of the demigods, had ruined the good
reputations of all the demigods by his unmannerly behavior. The words
used against Lord Siva by Daksa can also be understood in a different way,
in a good sense. For example, he stated that Siva is yasoghna, which means
one who spoils name and fame. So this also can be interpreted to mean
that he was so famous that his fame killed all other fame. Again, he used the
word nirapatrapa, which also can be used in two senses. ®@ne sense is one
who is stunted, and another sense is one who is the maintainer of persons
who have no other shelter. Generally Lord Siva is known as the lord of the
bhitas or lower grade of living creatures. They take shelter of Lord Siva
because he is very kind to everyone and is very quickly satisfied. Therefore
he is called Adutosa. To such men, who cannot approach other demigods
or Vignu, Lord Siva gives shelter. Therefore the word nirapatrapa can be
used in that sense.

daughter, who is equal to Gayatri, and has pretended to be just like an

PURPORT
Daksa’s statement that Lord Siva pretended to be an honest person
means that Siva was not honest because in spite of accepting the position
of Daksa’s son-in-law, he was not respectful to Daksa.

TRANSLATION
I had no desire to give my daughter to this person who has broken all
rules of civility. Because of his not observing the required rules and
regulations, he is impure, but I was obliged to hand over my daughter to
him just as one teaches the messages of the Vedas to a ৪0013.
PURPORT
A siidra is forbidden to take lessons from the Fedas because a 80010,
due to his unclean habits, is not worthy to hear such instructions. This
restriction, that unless one has acquired the brahminical qualifications
one should not read the Vedic literatures, is like the restriction that a law
student should not enter a law college unless he has graduated all lower
grades. According to the estimation of Daksa, Siva was unclean in habits
and not worthy to have the hand of his daughter, Sati, who was so en-
lightened, beautiful and chaste. The word used in this connection is
bhinna-setave, which means one who has broken all the regulations for
good behavior by not following the Vedic principles. In other words,
according to Daksa the entire transaction of the marriage of his daughter
with Siva was not in order.

TRANSLATION

He lives in filthy places like crematoriums, and his companions are the
ghosts and demons. Naked like a madman, sometimes laughing and some-
times crying, he smears crematorium ashes all over his body. He does not
bathe regularly, and he ornaments his body with a garland of skulls and
bones. Therefore only in name is he Siva, or auspicious; actually, he is the
most mad and inauspicious creature. Thus he is very dear to crazy beings
who are in the gross mode of ignorance, and he is their leader.

PURPORT

Those who do not regularly bathe are supposed to be in association
with ghosts and crazy creatures. Lord Siva appeared to be like that, but
his name, Siva, is actually fitting, for he is very kind to persons who are in
the darkness of the mode of ignorance, such as unclean drunkards who do
not regularly bathe. Lord Siva is so kind that he gives shelter to such
creatures and gradually elevates them to spiritual consciousness. Although
11 15 very difficult to raise such creatures to spiritual understanding, Lord
Siva takes charge of them, and therefore, as stated in the Vedas, Lord
Siva is all-auspicious. Thus by his association even such fallen souls can be
elevated. Sometimes it is ৪001) that great personalities meet with fallen
souls, not for any personal interest but for the benefit of those souls. In
the creation of the Lord there are different kinds of living creatures. Some
of them are in the mode of goodness, some are in the mode of passion, and


--- Page 59 ---
60 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 2
some are in the mode of ignorance. Lord Visnu takes charge of persons
who are advanced Krsna conscious Vaignavas, and Lord Brahma takes
charge of persons who are very much attached to material activities, but
Lord Siva is so kind that he takes charge of persons who are in gross
ignorance and whose behavior is lower than that of the animals. Therefore
Lord Siva is especially called auspicious.

TRANSLATION
On the request of Lord Brahma I handed over my chaste daughter to
him, although he is devoid of all cleanliness and his heart is filled with
nasty things.
PURPORT
It is the duty of parents to hand over their daughters to suitable persons,
just befitting their family tradition in cleanliness, gentle behavior, wealth,
social position, etc. Daksa was repentant that, on the request of Brahma,
who was his father, he had handed over his daughter to a person
who, according to his calculation, was nasty. He was so angry that he did
not acknowledge that the request was from his father. He referred to
Brahma as paramestht, the supreme teacher in the universe; because of
his temperament of gross anger, he was not even prepared to accept
Brahma as his father. In other words he accused even Brahma of being
less intelligent because he had advised si to hand over his beautiful
daughter to such a nasty fellow. In anger one forgets everything, and thus
Daksa, in anger, not only accused the great Lord Siva, but he criticized
his father, Lord Brahma, for his not very sanguine advice that Daksa
hand over his daughter to Lord Siva.

--- Page 61 ---
62 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 2
PURPORT
Due to this curse, Siva was deprived of his share in the oblations of
Vedic sacrifices. It is due to the curse of Daksa, Sri Viévanatha Cakravarti
comments in this connection, that Lord Siva was saved from the calamity
of taking part with other demigods, who were all materialistic. Lord Siva
is the greatest devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and it is
not fitting for him to eat or sit with materialistic persons like the demi-
gods. Thus the curse of Daksa was indirectly a blessing, for he would not
have to eat or sit with other demigods, who were too materialistic. There
is a practical example set for us by Gaurakiéora dasa Babaji Maharaja,
who used to sit on the side of a latrine to chant Hare Krsna. Many
materialistic persons used to come and bother him and disturb his daily
routine of chanting, so to avoid their company he used to sit by the side
of a latrine, where materialistic persons would not go because of the
filth and the obnoxious smell. However, Gauraki$ora dasa Babaji Maharaja
was so great that he was accepted as the spiritual master of such a great
personality as His Divine Grace Om Vigpupada Sri Srimad Bhaktisiddhanta
Sarasvati Gosvami Maharaja. The conclusion is that Lord Siva behaved in
his own way to avoid materialistic persons who might disturb him in

Text 20] Daksa Curses Lord Siva 63
TRANSLATION
Maitreya continued: My dear Vidura, in spite of the requests of all the
members of the sacrificial assembly, Daksa, in great anger, cursed Lord
Siva and then left the assembly and went back to his home.
PURPORT
Anger is so detrimental that even a great personality like Daksa, out of
anger, left the arena where Brahma was presiding and all the great sages
and pious and saintly persons were assembled. All of them requested him
not to leave, but, infuriated, he left, thinking that the auspicious place
was not fit for him. Puffed up by his exalted position, he thought that no
one was greater than him in argument. It appears that all the members of
the assembly, including Lord Brahma, requested him not to be angry and
leave their company, but in spite of all these requests, he left. That is the
effect of cruel anger. In Bhagavad-gita, therefore, it is advised that one
who desires to make tangible advancement in spiritual consciousness must
avoid three things—lust, anger and the mode of passion. Actually we can
see that lust, anger and passion make a man crazy, even though he be as
great as Daksa. The very name Daksa suggests that he was expert in all
material activities, but still, because of his aversion towards such a saintly
personality as Siva, he was attacked by these three enemies—anger, lust
and passion. Lord Caitanya, therefore, advised that one should be very
careful not to offend Vaignavas. He has compared offenses towards a
Vaignava to a mad elephant. As a mad elephant can do anything horrible,
so when a person offends a Vaispava he can perform any abominable
action.

TRANSLATION

Nandiévara, one of the principal associates of Lord Siva, upon under-
standing that Lord Siva had been cursed, became greatly angry. His eyes
became red, and he also prepared to curse Daksa and all the brahmanas
present there who tolerated Daksa’s cursing Siva in harsh words.

PURPORT

There is a long-standing dissension among some of the neophyte
Vaisnavas and Saivites; they are always at loggerheads. When Daksa cursed
Lord Siva in harsh words, some of the brahmapas present might have
enjoyed it because some brahmapas do not very much admire Lord Siva.
This is due to their ignorance of Lord Siva’s position. Nandisvara was
also affected by the cursing, but he did not follow the example of Lord
Siva, who was also present there. Lord Siva could also have cursed Daksa
in a similar way, but he was silent and tolerant; Nandisvara, his follower,
however, was not tolerant. Of course, as a follower it was right for him not
to tolerate an insult to his master, but he should not have also cursed the
brahmanas who were present. The entire issue was so complicated that
those who were not strong enough forgot their positions, and thus cursing
and countercursing went on in that great assembly. In other words, the
material field is so unsteady that even personalities like Nandisvara,
Daksa and many of the brahmanpas present were also infected by the atmo-
sphere of anger.

bhagavati—to Siva; apratidruhi—who is not envious; druhyati—bears envy;
ajitah—less intelligent persons; prthak-drstih—the vision of duality; tattva-

TRANSLATION

Anyone who has accepted Daksa as the most important personality and
has neglected Lord Siva because of envy is a less intelligent person and,
because of visualizing in duality, will be bereft of transcendental knowledge.

PURPORT

The first curse in this connection by Nandisvara was that anyone
supporting Daksa was foolishly identifying himself with the body, and
therefore, because Daksa had no transcendental knowledge, supporting
him would deprive one of transcendental knowledge. Daksa,
Nandidvara said, identified himself with the body like other materialistic
persons and was trying to derive all kinds of facilities in relationship with
the body. He had excessive attachment for the body and bodily relations
like wife, children, home and other such things, which are different from
the soul. Therefore Nandiévara’s curse was that anyone who supported
Daksa would be bereft of transcendental knowledge of the soul and thus
also be deprived of knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

66 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 2
TRANSLATION
Pretentious religious householder life, in which one is attracted to ma-
terial happiness and thus also attracted to the superficial explanation of the
Vedas, robs one of all intelligence and attaches one to fruitive activities as
all in all.
PURPORT
Persons who identify with bodily existence are attached to the fruitive
activities described in the Vedic literature. For example, in the Vedas it is
said that one who observes the caturmasya vow will attain eternal happiness
in the heavenly kingdom. In Bhagavad-gita, it is said that this flowery
language of the Vedas mostly attracts persons who identify with the body.
To them such happiness as that of the heavenly kingdom is everything;
they do not know that beyond that there is the spiritual kingdom or
kingdom of God, and they have no knowledge that one can go there.
Thus they are bereft of transcendental knowledge. Such persons are very
careful in observing the rules and regulations of household life in order
to be promoted in the next life to the moon or other heavenly planets. It
is stated here that such persons are attached to gramya-sukha, which means
material happiness, without knowledge of eternal, blissful, spiritual life.

PURPORT
The three curses mentioned above are sufficient to make one as dull as
stone, void of spiritual knowledge and preoccupied with materialistic
education, which is nescience. After uttering these curses, Nandiévara
then cursed the brahmanas to continue in the cycle of birth and death
because of their supporting Daksa in blaspheming Lord Siva.

These brahmanas take to education, austerity and vows only for the

PURPORT
The third curse which was inflicted by Nandisvara on the brahmanas
who supported Daksa is completely functioning in the age of Kali. The so-
called brahmapas are no longer interested in understanding the nature of
the Supreme Brahman, although a brahmapa means one who has attained


--- Page 68 ---
Text 27] Daksa Curses Lord Siva 69
knowledge about Brahman. In the Vedanta-siitra also it is stated, athato
brahma-jijiasa: this human form of life is meant for realization of the
Supreme Brahman or Absolute Truth, or, in other words, human life is
meant for one’s elevation to the post of a brahmapa. Unfortunately the
modern brahmapas, or so-called brahmanpas who come in originally
brahminical families, have left their own occupational duties, but they do
not allow others to occupy the posts of brahmanas. The qualifications for
brahmanas are described in the scriptures, in Srimad-Bhagavatam, Bhagavad-
gita and all other Vedic literatures. Brahmana is not a hereditary title or
position. If someone from a non-brahmana family (for example, one born
in the family of $00705) tries to become a brahmapa by being properly
qualified under the instruction of a bona fide spiritual master, these so-
called brahmanas will object. Such brahmapas, being cursed by
Nandisvara, are actually in a position where they have no discrimination
between eatables and noneatables and simply live to maintain the perish-
able material body and its family. Such fallen conditioned souls are not
worthy to be called brahmapas, but in Kali-yuga they claim to be
brahmanas, and if a person actually tries to attain the brahminical
qualifications, they try to hinder his progress. This is the situation in the
present age. Caitanya Mahaprabhu condemned this principle very strongly.
During His conversation with Ramananda Raya, He said that regardless of
whether a person is born in a brahmapa family or siadra family, regardless
of whether he is a householder or a sannyasi, if he knows the science of
Krsna he must be a spiritual master. He had many so-called दकाय
disciples like Haridasa Thakur and Ramananda Raya. Even the Gosvamis,
who were principal students of Lord Caitanya, were also ostracized from
brahmana society, but Caitanya Mahaprabhu, by His grace, made them
first-class Vaisnavas.

TRANSLATION
When all the hereditary brahmanas were thus cursed by Nandisvara,
the sage Bhrgu, as a reaction, condemned the followers of Lord Siva with
this very strong brahminical curse:
PURPORT
The word duratyaya is particularly used in reference to a brahma-danda,
or curse by a brihmapa. A curse by a brahmapa is very strong; therefore
it is called duratyaya, or insurmountable. As the Lord states in Bhagavad-
gita, the stringent laws of nature are insurmountable; similarly, if a
curse is uttered by a brahmana, that curse is also insurmountable. But
Bhagavad-gita also says that the curses or benedictions of the material
world are, after all, material creations. The Caitanya-caritamrta also
confirms that that which is accepted in this material world to be a benedic-
tion and that which is taken to be a curse are both on the same platform
because they are material. To get out of this material contamination, one
should take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as recommend-
ed in Bhagavad-gita: mam eva ye prapadyante mayam ९८277 taranti te. The
best path is to transcend all material curses and benedictions and take
shelter of the Supreme Lord, Krsna, and remain in a transcendental
position. Persons who have taken shelter of Krsna are always peaceful;
they are never cursed by anyone, nor do they attempt to curse anyone.
That is a transcendental position.

Text 29] Daksa Curses Lord Siva 71
TRANSLATION

One who takes a vow to satisfy Lord Siva or who follows such principles
will certainly become an atheist and be diverted from transcendental
scriptural injunctions.

PURPORT

It is sometimes seen that devotees of Lord Siva imitate the character-
istics of Lord Siva. For example, Lord Siva drank an ocean of poison, so
some of the followers of Lord Siva imitate him and try to take intoxicants
like gafiija (marijuana). Here the curse is that if someone follows such
principles he must become an infidel and turn against the principles of
Vedic regulation. It is said that such devotees of Lord Siva will be sac
chastra-paripanthinah, which means opposed to the conclusion of sastra, or
scripture. This is confirmed in the Padma Purana also. Lord Siva was
ordered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead to preach the impersonal
or Mayavadi philosophy for a particular purpose, just as Lord Buddha
preached the philosophy of voidness for particular purposes mentioned in
the sa@stras.

Sometimes it is necessary to preach a philosophical doctrine which is
against the Vedic conclusion. In the Siva Purana it is stated that Lord
Siva said to Parvati that in the Kali-yuga in the body of a brahmapa he
would preach the Mayavadi philosophy. Thus generally it is found that the
worshipers of Lord Siva are Mayavadi followers. Lord Siva himself says,
mayavadam asac-chastram. Asat-$astra, as explained here, means the
doctrine of Mayavadi impersonalism, or becoming one with the Supreme.
Bhrgu Muni cursed that persons who worshiped Lord Siva would become
followers of this Mayavadi asat-sastra. It is called asat-sastra because
the Mayavadi doctrine attempts to establish that the Supreme Personality
of Godhead is impersonal. Besides that, among the worshipers of Lord
Siva there is a section who live a devilish life. Srimad-Bhagavatam and
Narada-paiicardtra are authorized scriptures that are considered sat-§astra,
or scriptures which lead one to the path of God realization. Asat-sastras
are just the opposite.

Those who vow to worship Lord Siva are so foolish that they imitate

Indulging in wine and meat, keeping long hair on one’s head, not
bathing daily, and smoking 8৫710, marijuana, are some of the habits which
are accepted by foolish creatures who do not have regulated lives. By such
behavior one becomes devoid of transcendental knowledge. In the initiation
into the Siva mantra there are mudrikastaka, in which it is sometimes
recommended that one make his sitting place on the vagina and thus
desire nirvana, or dissolution of existence. In that process of worship,
wine is needed, or sometimes, in place of wine, palm tree juice which is
converted into an intoxicant. This is also offered according to Siva-agama,
a scripture on the method of worshiping Lord Siva.

Text 30] Daksa Curses Lord Siva 73
TRANSLATION

Bhrgu Muni continued: Since you blaspheme the Vedas and the
brahmanas, who are followers of the Vedic principles, it is understood
that you have already taken shelter of the doctrine of atheism.

PURPORT

Bhrgu Muni, in cursing Nandiévara, said that not only would they be
degraded as atheists because of his curse, but they had already fallen to
the standard of atheism because they had blasphemed the Vedas, which
are the source of human civilization. Human civilization is based on the
qualitative divisions of social order, namely the intelligent class, the
martial class, the productive class and the laborer class. The Vedas pro-
vide the right direction for advancing in spiritual cultivation and economic
development and regulating the principle of sense gratification so that
ultimately one may be liberated from material contamination to his real
state of spiritual identification (01১07 brahmasmi). As long as one is in the
contamination of material existence, he changes bodies from the
aquatics up to the position of Brahma, but the human form of life is
the highest perfectional life in the material world. The Vedas give direc-
tion how to elevate oneself in the next life, so the Vedas are the mother
for such instructions, and the brahmanas, or persons who are in knowl-
edge of the Vedas, are the father. Thus if one blasphemes the Vedas and
brahmanas, naturally one goes down to the status of atheism. The exact
word used in Sanskrit is nastika, which means one who does not believe in
the Vedas but manufactures some concocted system of religion. Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu has said that the followers of the Buddhist system
of religion are nastikas. In order to establish his doctrine of nonviolence,
Lord Buddha flatly refused to believe in the Vedas, and thus, later on,
Saikaracarya stopped this system of religion in India and forced it to go
outside India. Here it is stated, brahma ca brahmapan. Brahma means the
Vedas. Ahan brahmasmi means न्‌ am in full knowledge.” The Vedic
assertion is that one should think that he is Brahman, for actually he is
Brahman. If brahman or the Vedic spiritual science is condemned, and the
masters of the spiritual science, the brahmanas, are condemned, then
where does human civilization stand? Bhrgu Muni says, “It is not due to
my cursing that you shall become atheists; you are already situated in the
principle of atheism. Therefore you are condemned.”

TRANSLATION
The Vedas give the eternal regulative principles for auspicious advance-
ment in human civilization which have been rigidly followed in the past.
The strong evidence of this principle is the Supreme Personality of God-
head, who is called Janardana, the well-wisher of all living entities.
PURPORT
In the Bhagavad-gita the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, has
claimed that He is the father of all living entities, regardless of form. There
are 8,400,000 different species of life forms, and Lord Krsna claims that
He is the father of all. Because the living entities are parts and parcels of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they are all sons of the Lord, and
for their benefit, because they are hovering under the impression that
they can lord it over material nature, the Vedas are given to them for
their guidance. Therefore the Vedas are called apauruseya, for they are
not written by any man or demigod, including the first living creature,
Brahma. Brahma is not the creator or author of the Vedas. le is also one
of the living beings in this material world; therefore he does not have the
power to write or speak the Vedas independently. Every living entity
within this material world is subject to four deficiencies: he commits
mistakes, he accepts one thing for another, he cheats, and he has imperfect
senses. The Vedas, however, are not written by any living creature within
this material world. Therefore they are said to be apauruseya. No one can
trace out the history of the Vedas. Of course, modern human civilization
has no chronological history of the world or the universe, and-it cannot
present actual historical facts older than 3,000 years. But no one has


--- Page 74 ---
Text 31] Daksa Curses Lord Siva 75
traced out when the Vedas were written because they were never
written by any living being within this material world. All other systems
of knowledge are defective because they have been written or spoken by
men or demigods who are products of this material creation, but
Bhagavad-gita is apauruseya, for it was not spoken by any human being or
any demigod of this material creation; it was spoken by Lord Krsna, who
is beyond the material creation. That is accepted by such stalwart scholars
as Sankaracirya, not to speak of other acaryas such as Ramanujacarya
and Madhvacarya. Sarkaricirya has accepted that Nariyana and Krsna
are transcendental, and in Bhagavad-gita also Lord Krsna has established,
ahariv sarvasya prabhavo mattah ऽवा ण्व) pravartate: “I am the origin of
everything; everything has emanated from Me.” This material creation,
including Brahma and Siva and all the demigods, has been created by Him,
for everything has emanated from Him. He also says that (vedais ca sarvair
aham eva vedyah) the purpose of all the Vedas is to understand Him. He
is the original veda-vit, or knower of Vedanta, and vedanta-krt, or
compiler of the Vedas. Brahma is not the compiler of the Vedas.

In the beginning of Srimad-Bhagavatam it is established, tene brahma
hrda: the Supreme Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead, instructed
Brahma in the Vedic knowledge through his heart. Therefore the evidence
that Vedic knowledge is free from the defects of mistakes, illusions,
cheating and imperfection is that it is spoken by the Supreme Personality
of Godhead Janardana and has thus been followed from time immemorial,
beginning from Brahma. The Vedic religion or the principles of the Vedas
have been followed by the highly cultured population of India since time
immemorial; no one can trace out the history of Vedic religion. Therefore
it is sandtana, and any blasphemy against the Vedas is calculated to be
atheism. The Vedas are described as setu, which means bridge. If one wants
to attain his spiritual existence, one has to cross an ocean of nescience.
The Vedas are the bridge to cross such a great ocean. The Vedas describe
how to divide the human race into four divisions according to quality and
working capacity. This is a very scientific system, and it is also sanatana,
for no one can trace out its history, and it has no dissolution. No one can
stop the system of varpe and asrama, or the castes and divisions. For
example, whether or not one accepts the name brahmana, there is a class
in society which is known as the intelligent class and which is interested
in spiritual understanding and philosophy. Similarly, there is a class of men
who are interested in administration and in ruling others. In the Vedic
system these martially spirited men are called kgatriyas. Similarly, every-
where there is a class of men who are interested in economic development,


--- Page 75 ---
76 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 2
business, industry and moneymaking; they are called vai$yas. And there is
another class who are neither intelligent nor martially spirited nor
endowed with the capacity for economic development but who simply
can serve others. They are called $udras, or the laborer class. This system
is sandtana—it comes from time immemorial, and it will continue in
the same way. There is no power in the world which can stop it.
Therefore, since this sanatana-dharma system is eternal, one can elevate
himself to the highest standard of spiritual life by following the Vedic
principles. It is stated that formerly the sages followed this system; there-
fore to follow the Vedic system is to follow the standard etiquette of
society. But the followers of Lord Siva, who are drunkards, who are
addicted to intoxicants and sex life, who do not bathe and who smoke
ganja, are against all human etiquette. The conclusion is that persons who
rebel against the Vedic principles are themselves the evidence that the
Vedas are authoritative because by not following the Vedic principles they
become like animals. Such animalistic persons are themselves evidence of
the supremacy of the Vedic regulations.

TRANSLATION

By blaspheming the principles of the Vedas, which are the pure and
supreme path of the saintly persons, certainly you followers of Bhiitapati,
Lord Siva, will descend to the standard of atheism without a doubt.

PURPORT

Lord Siva is described here as bhita-rat. The ghosts and those who
are situated in the material mode of ignorance are called bhiitas, so
bhita-rat means the leader of the creatures who are in the lowest


--- Page 76 ---
Text 33] Daksa Curses Lord Siva rd
standard of the material modes of nature. Another meaning of bhiita is
anyone who has taken birth or anything which is produced, so in that
sense Lord Siva may be accepted as the father of this material world. Here,
of course, Bhrgu Muni takes Lord Siva as the leader of the lowest creatures.
The characteristics of the lowest class of men have already been described
—they do not bathe, they have long hair on their heads, and they are
addicted to intoxicants. In comparison to the path followed by the
followers of Bhatarat, the Vedic system is certainly excellent, for it
promotes people to spiritual life as the highest eternal principle of human
civilization. If one decries or blasphemes the Vedic principles, then he
falls to the standard of atheism.

The sage Maitreya said: When such cursing and countercursing was
going on between his followers and the parties of Daksa and Bhrgu, Lord
Siva became very morose. Not saying anything, he left the arena of the
sacrifice, followed by his disciples.
PURPORT
Here Lord Siva's excellent character is described. In spite of the
cursing and countercursing between the parties of Daksa and Siva,
because he is the greatest Vaisnava, he was so sober that he did not say
anything. A Vaisnava is always tolerant, and Lord Siva is considered the


--- Page 77 ---
78 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 2
topmost Vaisnava, so his character, as shown in this scene, is excellent. He
became morose because he knew that these people, both his men and
Daksa’s, were unnecessarily cursing and countercursing one another, with-
out any interest in the spiritual life. From his point of view, he did not
see anyone as lower or higher because he is a Vaisnava. As stated in
Bhagavad-gita, panditah sama-dar$inah: one who is perfectly learned
does not see anyone as lesser or greater because he sees everyone from
the spiritual platform. Thus the only alternative left to Lord Siva was to
leave in order to stop his follower, Nandiévara, as well as Bhrgu Muni,
from cursing and countercursing in that way.

The sage Maitreya continued: O Vidura, all the progenitors of the

sacrifice is the best way to worship the Supreme Lord, Hari, the Person-
ality of Godhead.
PURPORT
It is clearly stated here that the stalwart personalities who generate the
entire population of the world are interested in satisfying the Supreme
Personality of Godhead by offering sacrifices. The Lord also says in
Bhagavad -gita, bhoktarar yajiia-tapasam. One may engage in performing
sacrifices and severe austerities for perfection, but they are all meant to
satisfy the Supreme Lord. If such activities are performed for personal
satisfaction, that is called pasapda, or atheism; but when they are per-
formed for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord, that is the Vedic

principle. All the assembled sages performed sacrifices for one thousand
years.

TRANSLATION
My dear Vidura, carrier of bows and arrows, all the demigods who were
performing the sacrifice took their bath at the confluence of the Ganges
and the Yamuna after completing the yajiia performance. Such a bath is
called avabhrtha-snana. Thus becoming purified in heart, they departed
for their respective abodes.
PURPORT
After Lord Siva and, previously, Daksa, left the arena of sacrifice, the
sacrifice was not stopped; the sages went on for many years in order to
satisfy the Supreme Lord. The sacrifice was not destroyed for want of
Siva and Daksa, and the sages went on with their activities. In other
words, it may be assumed that if one does not worship the demigods,
even up to Lord Siva and Brahma, one can nevertheless satisfy the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita.
Kamais tais tair hrte-jianah prapadyante’nya-devatah. Persons who are
impelled by lust and desire go to the demigods to derive some material
benefit. Bhagavad-gita uses the very specific words nasti buddhik, meaning
persons who have lost their sense or intelligence. Only such persons care for
demigods and want to derive material benefit from them. Of course, this
does not mean that one should not show respect to the demigods, but there
is no need to worship them. One who is honest may be faithful to the
government, but he does not need to bribe the government servants.
Bribery is illegal; one does not bribe a government servant, but that does


--- Page 79 ---
80 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 2
not mean that he does not show him respect. Similarly, one who engages
in the transcendental loving service of the Supreme Lord does not need to
worship any demigod, nor does he have any tendency to show disrespect
to the demigods. Elsewhere in Bhagavad-gita it is stated, ye’py anya-
devata-bhakta yajante sraddhayanvitdh. The Lord says that anyone who
worships the demigods is also worshiping Him, but he is worshiping
avidhi-pirvakam, which means without following the regulative principles.
The regulative principle isto worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Worship of demigods may indirectly be worship of the Personality of
Godhead, but it is not regulated. By worshiping the Supreme Lord, one
automatically serves all the demigods because they are parts and parcels of
the whole. If one supplies water to the root of a tree, all the parts of the
tree, such asthe leaves and branches, are automatically satisfied, and if one
supplies food to the stomach, all the limbs of the body—the hands, legs,
fingers, etc.—are nourished. Thus by worshiping the Supreme Personality
of Godhead one can satisfy all the demigods, but by worshiping all the
demigods one does not completely worship the Supreme Lord. Therefore
worship of the demigods is irregular, and it is disrespectful to the
scriptural injunctions. |
In this age of Kali it is practically impossible to perform the deva-yajiia
or sacrifices to the demigods. As such, in this age Srimad-Bhdgavatam recom-
mends sankirtana-yajiia. Yajiaih sanikirtana-prayair yajanti hi sumedhasah.
(Bhag. 11.5.32) “In this age the intelligent person completes the perfor-
mances of all kinds of yajiias simply by chanting Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna,
Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare / Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare
Hare.” Tasmin tuste jagat-tustah: “When Lord Vignu is satisfied, all the
demigods who are part and parcels of the Supreme Lord are satisfied.”
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fourth Canto, Second
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled, “Daksa Curses Lord Siva.”

TRANSLATION
Maitreya continued: In this manner the tension between the father-in-
law and son-in-law, Daksa and Lord Siva, continued for a considerably
long period.
PURPORT
The previous chapter has already explained that Vidura questioned the
sage Maitreya as to the cause of the misunderstanding between Lord Siva
and Daksa. Another question is why the strife between Daksa and his son-
in-law caused Satito destroy her body. The chief reason for Sati’s giving up
her body was that her father, Daksa, began another sacrificial performance
to which Lord Siva was not invited at all. Generally, when any sacrifice
81


--- Page 81 ---
82 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 3
is performed, although each and every sacrifice is intended to pacify the Su-
preme Personality of Godhead, Visnu, all the demigods, especially Lord
Brahma and Lord Siva and the other principal demigods, such as Indra and
Candra, are invited, and they take part. It is said that unless all the
demigods are present, no sacrifice is complete. In the tension between
the father-in-law and son-in-law, Daksa began another yajiia performance,
to which Lord Siva was not invited. Daksa was the chief progenitor
employed by Lord Brahma, and he was a son of Brahma, so he had a high
position and was also very proud.

_ TRANSLATION
When Lord Brahma appointed Daksa as the chief of all the Prajapatis,
the progenitors of population, Daksa became very much puffed up.
PURPORT
Although he was envious and was inimical towards Lord Siva, Daksa was
appointed the chief of all Prajapatis. That was the cause of his excessive
pride. When a man becomes too proud of his material possessions, he can
perform any disastrous act, so Daksa acted out of false prestige. That is
described in this chapter.

TRANSLATION

Daksa began a sacrifice named Vajapeya, and he became excessively
confident of his support by Lord Brahma. He then performed another
great sacrifice named Brhaspati-sava.

PURPORT

In the Fedas it is prescribed that before performing a Brhaspati-sava
sacrifice, one should perform the sacrifice named Vajapeya. While perform-
ing these sacrifices, however, Daksa neglected great devotees like Lord
Siva. According to Vedic scriptures, the demigods are eligible to participate
in yajiias and share the oblations, but he wanted to avoid them. All
sacrifices are intended to pacify Lord Visnu, but Lord Vispu includes all
His devotees. Brahma, Lord Siva and the other demigods are all obedient
servants of Lord ছাড়া; therefore Lord Visnu is never satisfied without
them. But Daksa, being puffed up with his power, wanted to deprive Lord
Brahmi and Lord Siva of participation in the sacrifice, understanding that
if one satisfies Visnu, it is not necessary to satisfy His followers. But that
is not the process. Visnu wants His followers to be satisfied first. Lord
Krsna says, mad-bhakta-piujabhyadhika: “The worship of My devotees is
better than worship of Myself.” Similarly, in the Siva Purana, it is stated
that the best mode of worship is to offer oblations to Visnu, but better
than that is to worship the devotees of Krsna. Thus Daksa’s determination
to neglect Lord Siva in the sacrifices was not fitting.

TRANSLATION
While the sacrifice was being performed, many brahmarsis, great sages,
ancestral demigods and other demigods, their wives all very nicely deco-
rated with ornaments, attended from different parts of the universe.
PURPORT
In any auspicious ceremony, such as a marriage ceremony, sacrificial
ceremony or piija ceremony, it is auspicious for married women to decorate
themselves very nicely with ornaments, fine clothing and cosmetics. These
are auspicious signs, and many heavenly women assembled with their
husbands, the devargis, demigods and rijargis, in that great sacrifice named
Brhaspati-sava. It is specifically mentioned in this verse that they ap-
proached with their husbands, for when a woman is decorated nicely, her
husband becomes more cheerful. The nice decorations, ornaments and dress
of the wives of the demigods and sages and the cheerfulness of the demi-
gods and sages themselves were all-auspicious signs for the ceremony.

TRANSLATION
The chaste lady Sati, the daughter of Daksa, heard the heavenly denizens
flying in the sky conversing about the great sacrifice being performed by
her father. When she saw that from all directions the beautiful wives of the
heavenly denizens, their eyes very beautifully glittering, were near her
residence and were going to the sacrifice dressed in fine clothing and
ornamented with earrings and necklaces with lockets, she approached her
husband, the master of the bhiitas, in great anxiety, and spoke as follows.
PURPORT
It appears that the residence of Lord Siva was not on this planet but
was somewhere in outer space, otherwise how could Sati see the airplanes
coming from different directions towards this planet and hear the passen-
gers talking about the great sacrifice being performed by Daksa? Sati is
described here as Daksayani because she was the daughter of Daksa. The
mention of upadeva-vara refers to inferior demigods like the Gandharvas,
Kinnaras and Uragas, who are not exactly demigods but are between the
demigods and the human beings. They were also coming in planes. The


--- Page 85 ---
86 Srimad-Bhagavatam | Canto 4, Ch. 3
word sva-nilayabhyase indicates that they were passing right near her
residential quarters. The dresses and bodily features of the wives of the
heavenly denizens are very nicely described here. Their eyes moved, their
earrings and other ornaments glittered and glared, their dresses were the
nicest possible, and all of them had special lockets on their necklaces.
Each woman was accompanied by her husband. Thus they looked so
beautiful that Sati, Dakgsayani, was impelled to dress similarly and go to
the sacrifice with her husband. That is the natural inclination of a woman.

PURPORT
Sati knew of the tension between her father and her husband, but still
she expressed to her husband, Lord Siva, that since such sacrifices were
going on at her father’s house and so many demigods were going, she also
desired to go. But she could not express her willingness directly, and so

she told her husband that if he desired to go, then she could also accom-
pany him. In other words, she submitted her desire very politely to her
husband.

I think that all my sisters must have gone to this great sacrificial cere-
mony with their husbands just to see their relatives. 1 also desire to
decorate myself with the ornaments given to me by my father and go
there with you to participate in that assembly.
PURPORT
It is a woman’s nature to want to decorate herself with ornaments and
nice dresses and accompany her husband to social functions, meet friends
and relatives and enjoy life in that way. This propensity is not unusual
because woman is the basic principle of material enjoyment. Therefore in
Sanskrit the word for woman is str, which means one who expands the
field of material enjoyment. In the material world there is an attraction
between woman and man. This is the arrangement of conditional life. A
woman attracts a man, and in that way the scope of material activities,
involving house, wealth, children and friendship, increases, and thus
instead of decreasing one’s material demands, one becomes entangled in


--- Page 87 ---
88 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 3
material enjoyment. Lord Siva, however, is different; therefore his name
is Siva. He is not at all attracted by material enjoyment, although his wife,
Sati, was the daughter of a very great leader and was given to him by the
request of Brahma. Lord Siva was reluctant, but Sati, as a woman, the
daughter of a king, wanted enjoyment. She wanted to go to her father’s
house, just as her other sisters might have done, and meet them and enjoy
social life. Here, she specifically indicated that she would decorate herself
with the ornaments given by her father. She did not say that she would
decorate herself with the ornaments given by her husband because her
husband was callous about all such matters. He did not know how to
decorate his wife and take part in social life because he was always in
ecstasy with thoughts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. According
to the Vedic system, a daughter is given a sufficient dowry at the time of
her marriage, so Sati was also given a dowry by her father, and ornaments
were included. It is also the custom that the husband gives some ornaments,
but here it is particularly mentioned that her husband, being materially
almost nothing, could not do so; therefore she wanted to decorate herself
with the ornaments given by her father. It was fortunate for Sati that
Lord Siva did not take the ornaments from his wife and spend them for
ganja because those who imitate Lord Siva in smoking gaiija exploit
everything from household affairs; they take all of their wives’ property
and spend on smoking, intoxication and similar other activities.

My sisters, the sisters of my mother and their husbands and other
affectionate relatives must be assembled there, so if I go I shall be able to
see them, and I shall be able to see the flapping flags and the performance
of the sacrifice by the great sages. For these reasons, my dear husband, I
am very much anxious to go.
PURPORT
As stated before, the tension between the father-in-law and son-in-law
persisted for a considerable time. So Sati had not gone to her father’s house
for a long while. Thus she was very anxious to go to her father’s house,
particularly because on that occasion her sisters and their husbands and
her mother’s sisters would be there. As is natural for a woman, she wanted
to dress equally to her other sisters and also be accompanied by her
husband. She did not, of course, want to go alone.

you know, I am not conversant with the truth. Therefore I wish to see my

PURPORT

Daksayani, Sati, knew very well that her husband, Lord Siva, was not
very much interested in the glaring manifestation of the material world,
which is caused by the interaction of the three modes of nature. Therefore
she addressed her husband as aja, one who has transcended the bondage
of birth and death, or one who has realized his eternal position. She stated,
“The illusion of accepting the perverted reflection, the material or cosmic
manifestation, to be real is not present in you because you are self-
realized. For you the attraction of social life and the consideration that
someone is father, someone is mother and someone is sister, which are
illusory relationships, is alrcady over, but because 1 am a poor woman 1
am not so advanced in transcendental realization. Therefore naturally
these appear to me as real.” Only less intelligent persons accept this
perverted reflection of the spiritual world to be real. Those who are
under the spell of the external energy accept this manifestation to be fact,
whereas those who are advanced in spiritual realization know that it is
illusion. Actual reality is elsewhere, in the spiritual world. “But as far as
I am concerned,” Safi said, “I do not have much knowledge about self-
realization. 1 am poor because 1 do not know the actual facts. | am
attracted by my birthplace, and | want to see it.”” One who has attraction
for his birthplace, for his body, and for other such items mentioned in the
Bhagavatam is considered to be like an ass or a cow. Sati might have heard
all this many times from her husband, Lord Siva, but because she was a
woman, yosil, she still hankered after the same material objects of affection
The word yosit means “one who is enjoyed.” Therefore woman is called
yosit. In spiritual advancement, association with yosit is always restricted
because if one is like a play doll in the hands of yosit, then all his spiritual
advancement is at once stopped. It is said, “Those who are just like play-
things in the hands of a woman cannot make any advancement in spiritual
realization.”

0 never-born, 0 blue-throated one, not only my relatives but also other
women, dressed in nice clothes and decorated with ornaments, are going
there with their husbands and friends. Just see how their flocks of white
airplanes have made the entire sky very beautiful.

PURPORT

Here Lord Siva is addressed as abhava, which means one who is never
born, although generally he is known as bhava, one who is born. Actually
Rudra, Lord Siva, is born from the eyes of Brahma, who is called
svayambhuva because he is not born of any human being or material
creature but is born directly from the lotus flower which grows from the
abdomen of Visnu. When Lord Siva is addressed here as abhava, this may
be taken to mean one who has never felt material miseries. Sati wanted to
impress upon her husband that even those who were not related to her
father were also going, to say nothing of herself, who was intimately related
with him. Lord Siva is addressed here as blue-throated. Lord Siva drank an
ocean of poison and kept it in his throat, not swallowing it or allowing it
to go down to his stomach, and thus his throat became blue. Since then he
has been known as nilakantha, or blue-throated. The reason that Lord Siva
drank an ocean of poison was for others’ benefit. When the ocean was
churned by the demigods and the demons, the churning at first produced
poison, so because the poisonous ocean might have affected others who
were not so advanced, Lord Siva drank all the ocean water. In other
words, he could drink such a great amount of poison for others’ benefit,
and now, since his wife was personally requesting him to go to her
father’s house, even if he did not wish to give that permission, he should do
so oul of his great kindness.

The great sage Maitreya said: Lord Siva, the deliverer of the hill

though at the same time he remembered the malicious, heart-piercing
speeches delivered by Daksa before the guardians of the universal affairs.


--- Page 93 ---
94 Srimad-Bhagavatam [ Canto 4, Ch. 3
PURPORT

Wken Lord Siva heard from his wife about Daksa, the psychological
effect was that he immediately remembered the strong words which were
spoken against him in the assembly of the guardians of the universe, and,
remembering those words, he was sorry at heart, although to please his
wife he smiled. In Bhagavad-gita it is said that a liberated person is always
in mental equilibrium in both the distress and the happiness of this mate-
rial world. Therefore the question may now be raised why a liberated
personality like Lord Siva was so unhappy because of the words of Daksa.
The answer is given by Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakur. Lord Siva is
atmarama, or situated in complete self-realization, but because he is the
incarnation in charge of the material mode of ignorance, tamoguna, he is
sometimes affected by the pleasure and pain of the material world. The
difference between the pleasure and pain of this material world and that
of the spiritual world is that in the spiritual world the effect is qualita
tively absolute. Therefore one may feel sorry in the absolute world, but
the manifestation of so-called pain is always full of bliss. For instance,
once Lord Krsna, in His childhood, was chastised by His mother,
Yasoda, and Lord Krsna cried. But although He shed tears from His
eyes, this is not to be considered a reaction of the mode of ignorance, for
the incident was full of transcendental pleasure. When Krsna was play-
ing in so many ways, sometimes it appeared that He caused distress to the
gopis, but actually such dealings were full of transcendental bliss. That
is the difference between the material and spiritual worlds. The spiritual
world, where everything is pure, is pervertedly reflected in this material
world. Since everything in the spiritual world is absolute, in the spiritual
varieties of apparent pleasure and pain there is no other perception than
eternal bliss, whereas in the material world, because everything is contami-
nated by the modes of material nature, there are feelings of pleasure and
pain. Therefore because Lord Siva, although a fully self-realized person,
was in charge of the material mode of ignorance, he felt sorrow.

provided such a friend does not find fault with the guest because of
bodily identification and thereby become angry towards him.
PURPORT
Lord Siva could foresee that as soon as Sati reached her father’s house,
her father, Daksa, being too puffed up because of bodily identification,
would be angry at her presence, and although she was innocent and fault-
less, he would be mercilessly angry towards her. He warned that since her
father was too puffed up by his material possessions, he would be angry,
and this would be intolerable for her. Therefore it was better that she
not go. This fact was already experienced by Lord Siva because although
Lord Siva was faultless, Daksa cursed him in so many harsh words.

TRANSLATION

Although the six qualities of education, austerity, wealth, beauty,
youth and heritage are for the highly elevated, one who is proud of
possessing them becomes blind, and thus he loses his good sense and
cannot appreciate the glories of great personalities.

PURPORT

It may be argued that since Daksa was very learned, wealthy and
austere and had descended from a very exalted heritage, how could he
be unnecessarily angry towards another? The answer is that when the
qualities of good education, good parentage, beauty and sufficient wealth
are misplaced in a person who is puffed up by all these possessions, they
produce a very bad result. Milk is a very nice food, but when milk
is touched by an envious serpent it becomes poisonous. Similarly, material
assets such as education, wealth, beauty and good parentage are undoubt-
edly nice, but when they decorate persons of a malicious nature, then they
act adversely. Another example, given by Canakya Pandit, is that a serpent
that has a jewel on its head is still fearful because it is a serpent. A serpent,
by nature, is envious of other living entities, even though they be faultless.
When a serpent bites another creature, it is not necessarily because the
other creature is at fault; it is the habit of the serpent to bite innocent
creatures. Similarly, although Daksa was qualified by many material assets,
because he was proud of his possessions and because he was envious, all
those qualities were polluted. It is sometimes, therefore, detrimental for a
person advancing in spiritual consciousness or Krsna consciousness to
possess such material assets. Kuntidevi, while offering prayers to Krsna,
addressed Him as akificana-gocara, one who is easily approached by those
who are bereft of all material acquisitions. Material exhaustion is an
advantage for advancement in Krsna consciousness, although if one is con-
scious of his eternal relationship with the Supreme Personality of God-
head, he can utilize his material assets, such as great learning and beauty
and exalted ancestry, for the service of the Lord; then such assets become


--- Page 96 ---
Text 18] Talks Between Lord Siva and Sati 97
glorious. In other words, unless one is Krsna conscious, all his material
possessions are zero, but when this zero is by the side of the Supreme One,
it at once increases in value to ten. Unless situated by the side of the
Supreme One, zero is always zero; one can add one hundred zeros, but
the value will still remain zero. Unless one’s material assets are used in
Krsna consciousness, they may play havoc and degrade the possessor.

TRANSLATION
One should not go to anyone’s house, even on the consideration of his
being a relative or a friend, when the man is disturbed in his mind and looks
upon the guest with raised eyebrows and angry eyes.
PURPORT
However low a person may be, he is never unkind to his children, wife
and nearest kin; even a tiger is kind to his cubs, for within the animal
kingdom the cubs are treated very nicely. Since Sati was the daughter of
Daksa, however cruel and contaminated he might be, naturally it was
expected that he would receive her very nicely. But here it is indicated by.
the word anavasthita that such a person cannot be trusted. Tigers are
very kind to their cubs, but it is also known that sometimes they eat them.
Malicious persons should not be trusted because they are always unsteady.
Thus Sati was advised not to go to her father’s house because to accept

such a father as a relative and to go to his house without being properly
invited was not suitable.

TRANSLATION

Lord Siva continued: If one is hurt by the arrows of an enemy, he is not
as aggrieved as when he is cut by the unkind words of a relative, for such
grief continues to rend his heart day and night.

PURPORT

Sat might have concluded that she would take the risk of
going to her father’s house, and even if her father spoke unkindly
against her she would be tolerant, as a son sometimes tolerates the
reproaches of his parents. But Lord Siva reminded her that she would
not be able to tolerate such unkind words because natural psychology
dictates that one can suffer harm from an enemy and not mind so much
because pain inflicted by an enemy is natural; but when one is hurt by the
strong words of a relative, he suffers the effects continually, day and night,
and sometimes the injury becomes so intolerable that one commits suicide.

Lord Siva put forward the argument that even if Sati proposed to go
alone, without her husband, still she would not be received well because
she was his wife. There was every chance of a catastrophe, even if she
wanted to go alone. Therefore Lord Siva indirectly requested her not to
go to her father’s house.

One who is conducted by false ego and is thus always distressed, both
mentally and sensually, cannot tolerate the opulence of self-realized
persons, and, being unable to rise to the standard of self-realization, he
envies such persons as much as demons envy the Supreme Personality of
Godhead.

PURPORT

The real reason for the enmity between Lord Siva and Daksa is ex-
plained here. Daksa was envious of Lord Siva because of his high position as
an incarnation of a quality of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and
because he was directly in contact with the Supersoul and was therefore
honored and given a better sitting place than him. There were many other
reasons also. Daksa, being materially puffed up, could not tolerate the
high position of Lord Siva, so his anger at Lord Siva’s nol standing up
in his presence was only the final manifestation of his envy. Lord Siva is
always in meditation and always perceives the Supersoul, as expressed here
by the words piaruga-buddhi-saksinam. The position of one whose intel-
ligence is always absorbed in meditation upon the Supreme Personality of
Godhead is very great and cannot be imitated by anyone, especially an
ordinary person. When Daksa entered the arena of yajiia, Lord Siva was in
meditation and might not have seen Daksa enter, but Daksa took the
opportunity to curse him because he had maintained an envious attitude
towards Lord Siva for a long time. Those who are actually sclf-realized see
every individual body as a temple of the Supreme Personality of Godhead
because the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in His Paramatma feature,
is residing in everyone’s body.

When one offers respect to the body, itis not to the material body but
to the presence of the Supreme Lord. Thus one who is always in medita-


--- Page 100 ---
Text 22] Talks Between Lord Siva and Sati 101
tion upon the Supreme Lord is always offering Him obeisances. But since
Daksa was not very elevated, he thought that obeisances were offered to
the material body, and because Lord Siva did not offer respect to his
material body, Daksa became envious. Such persons, being unable to rise
to the standard of self-realized souls like Lord Siva, are always envious.
The example given here is very suitable. Asuras, demons or atheists, are
always envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; they simply want
to kill Him. Even in this age we find some so-called scholars commenting
on Bhagavad-gita who are envious of Krsna. When Krsna says, manmana
bhava mad-bhakto (Bg. 18.65)—‘“ Always think of Me, become My devotee,
and surrender unto Me.”’—the so-called scholars comment that it is not to
Krsna that we have to surrender. That is envy. The asuras or atheists, the
demons, without reason or cause, are envious of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. Similarly, instead of offering respect to self-realized persons,
foolish men who cannot approach the highest standard of self-realization
are always envious, although there is no reason.

--- Page 101 ---
102 Srimad-Bhagavatam | Canto 4, Ch. 3
offer such respects to the Supersoul who is sitting within the body, not to
the person identified with the body.
PURPORT
It may be argued that since Daksa was the father-in-law of Lord Siva,
it was certainly the duty of Lord Siva to offer him respect. In answer to
that argument it is explained here that when a learned person stands up or
offers obeisances in welcome, he offers respect to the Supersoul, who is
sitting within everyone’s heart. It is seen, therefore, among Vaisnavas, that
even when a disciple offers obeisances to his spiritual master, the spiritual
master immediately returns the obeisances because they are mutually
offered not to the body but to the Supersoul. Therefore the spiritual master
also offers respect to the Supersoul situated in the body of the disciple.
The Lord says in Srimad-Bhagavatam that offering respect to His devotee
is more valuable than offering respect to Himself. Devotees do not
identify with the body, so offering respect to a Vaisnava means offering
respect to 19100. It is stated also that, as a matter of etiquette, as soon as
one sees a Vaignava he must immediately offer him respect, indicating the
Supersoul sitting within. A Vaisnava sees the body as a temple of Vispu.
Since Lord Siva had already offered respect to the Supersoul in Krsna
consciousness, offering respect to Daksa, who identified with his body,
was already performed. There was no need to offer respect to his body
because that is not directed by any Vedic injunction.

TRANSLATION

I am always engaged in offering obeisances to Lord Vasudeva in pure
Krsna consciousness. Krsna consciousness is always pure consciousness,
and in that consciousness the Supreme Personality of Godhead, known as
Vasudeva, is revealed without any covering.

PURPORT

The living entity is constitutionally pure. Asango hy atmayarm purusah.
In the Vedic literature it is said that the soul is always pure and uncontami-
nated by material attachment. The identification of the body with the soul is
due to misunderstanding. As soon as one is fully Krsna conscious it is to
be understood that he is in his pure, original constitutional position. This
state of existence is called suddha-sattva, which means that it is transcen-
dental to the material qualities. Since this suddha-sattva existence is under
the direct action of the internal potency, in this state the activities of
malcrial consciousness stop. For example, when iron is put into a fire, it
becomes warm, and when it is red-hot, although it is iron, it acts like fire.
Similarly, when copper is surcharged with electricity, its action as copper
stops; il acts as electricity. It is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita that any-
one who engages in unadulterated devotional service to the Lord is at
once clevated to the position of pure Brahman.

mam ca yo vyabhicarena bhakti-yogena sevate
sa gunan samatityaitan brahma-bhityaya kalpate
(Bg. 14.26)

Therefore suddha-sattva, as described in this verse, is the transcendental
position, which is technically called vasudeva. Vasudeva is also the name of
the person from whom Krsna appears. This verse explains that the pure
state is called vasudeva because in that state Vasudeva, the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead, is revealed without any covering. To execute un-
adulterated devotional service, therefore, one must follow the rules and
regulations of devotional service without desire to gain material profit by
fruitive activities or mental speculation.

In pure devotional service one simply serves the Supreme Personality
of Godhead as a matter of duty, without reason and without being
impeded by material conditions. That is called suddha-sattva, or vasudeva,


--- Page 103 ---
104 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 3
because in that stage the Supreme Person, Krsna, is revealed in the heart
of the devotee. Srila Jiva Gosvami has very nicely described this vasudeva
or $uddha-sattva in his Bhagavat-sandarbha. He explains that astotlara-
Sata (108) is added to the name of the spiritual master to indicate one who is
situated in suddha-sattva or in the transcendental state of vasudeva. The
word vasudeva is also used for other purposes. For example, vasudeva
also means one who is everywhere or all-pervading. The sun is also called
vasudeva-sabditam. The word vasudeva may be utilized for different pur-
poses, but whatever purpose we adopt, Vasudeva means the all-pervading
or localized Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Bhagavad-gita it is also
stated, Vasudevah sarvam iti (Bg. 7.19). Factual realization is to understand
Vasudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and surrender unto Him.
Vasudeva is the field where Vasudeva, the Supreme Personality of God-
head, is revealed. When one is free from the contamination of material
nature and is situated in pure Krsna consciousness or in the vasudeva
state, Vasudeva, the Supreme Person, is revealed. This state is also called
kaivalya, which means pure consciousness. Janam sattvikariv kaivalyam.
When one is situated in pure transcendental knowledge, that is called
kaivalya. Therefore vasudeva also means kaivalya, a word which is gener-
ally used by impersonalists. Impersonal kaivalya is not the last stage of
realization, but in Krsna consciousness kaivalya, when one understands
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then he is successful. In that pure
state, by hearing, chanting, remembering, etc., because of the development
of knowledge of the science of Krsna, one can understand the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. All these activities are under the guidance of
the internal energy of the Supreme Lord. The action of the internal
potency is also described in this verse as apavrtah, free from any covering.
Because the Supreme Personality of Godhead, His name, His form, His
quality, His paraphernalia, etc., are beyond material nature, being transcen-
dental, it is not possible to understand any one of them with the material-
istic senses. When the senses are purified by the discharge of pure devo-
tional service (hrsikena hrsikesa-sevanam bhaktir ucyate), the pure senses
can see Krsna without covering. Now one may inquire that since factually
the devotee has the same material existential body, how is it possible that
the same materialistic eyes become purified by devotional service? The
example, as stated by Lord Caitanya, is that devotional service cleanses
the mirror of the mind. In a clean mirror one can see his face very dis-
tinctly. Similarly, simply by cleansing the mirror of the mind one can have
a clear conception of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is stated in
Bhagavad-gita, abhyasa-yoga-yuktena. By executing one’s prescribed duties


--- Page 104 ---
Text 23] Talks Between Lord Siva and Sati 105
in devotional service, cetasa nanyagamina (Bg. 8.8), or simply by hearing
about God and chanting about Him, if one’s mind is always engaged in
chanting and hearing and is not allowed to go elsewhere, one can realize
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As confirmed by Lord Caitanya,
by the bhakti-yoga process, beginning from hearing and chanting, one can
cleanse the heart and mind, and thus one can clearly see the face of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Lord Siva said that since his heart was always filled with the conception
of Vasudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, because of His presence
within his mind and heart, he was always offering obeisances unto Him. In
other words, Lord Siva is always in trance, samadhi. This samadhi is not
under the control of the devotee; it is under the control of Vasudeva, for
the entire internal energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead acts
under His order. Of course the material energy also acts by His order, but
His direct will is specifically executed through the spiritual energy. Thus
by His spiritual energy He reveals Himself. It is stated in Bhagavad-gita,
sambhavamy atma-mayaya. (Bg. 4.6). Atma-mayayd@ means internal potency.
By His sweet will He reveals Himself by His internal potency, being satis-
fied by the transcendental loving service of the devotee. The devotee never
commands, “My dear Lord, please come here so that I can see You.” It is
not the position of the devotee to command the Supreme Personality of
Godhead to come before him or to dance before him. There are many so-
called devotees who command the Lord to come before them dancing.
The Lord, however, is not subject to anyone’s command, but if He is
satisfied by one’s pure devotional activities, He reveals Himself. Therefore
a meaningful word in this verse is adhoksaja, for it indicates that the
activities of our material senses will fail to realize the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. One cannot realize the Supreme Personality of Godhead
simply by the attempt of his speculative mind, but if one desires he can
subdue all the material activities of his senses, and by manifesting His
spiritual energy the Lord can reveal Himself to the pure devotee. When
the Supreme Personality of Godhead reveals Himself to the pure devotee,
the devotee has no other duty than to offer Him respectful obeisances.
The Absolute Truth reveals Himself to the devotee in His form. He is not
formless. Vasudeva is not formless because it is stated in this verse that as
soon as the Lord reveals Himself, the devotee offers his obeisances. Obei-
sances are offered to a person, not Lo anything impersonal. One should not
accept the Mayavadi interpretation that Vasudeva is impersonal. As stated
in Bhagavad-gita, prapadyate, one surrenders. One surrenders {० a person,
not to impersonal nonduality. Whenever there is a question of surrendering or


--- Page 105 ---
106 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 3
offering obeisances, there must be an object of surrender or obeisances.

TRANSLATION
Therefore you should not see your father, although he is the giver of
your body, because he and his followers are envious of me. Because of his
envy, O most worshipful one, he has insulted me with cruel words although
I am innocent.
PURPORT
For a woman, both the husband and the father are equally worshipable.
The husband is the protector of a woman during her youthful life, where-
as the father is her protector during her childhood. Thus both are
worshipable, but especially the father because he is the giver of the body.
Lord + reminded Sati, “Your father is undoubtedly worshipable, even
more than I am, but take care, for although he is the giver of your body, he
may also be the taker of your body because when you see your father,
because of your association with me, he may insult you. An insult from a
relative is worse than death, especially when one is well situated.”

Siva’s warning. Her mind unsettled, she moved in and oul of the room as a
swing moves this way and that.
PURPORT
Sats mind was divided about whether to go to her father’s house or
obey the orders of Lord Siva. The struggle between the two decisions was
109

TRANSLATION
Sati felt very sorry at being forbidden to go see her relatives at her
father’s house, and due to affection for them, tears fell from her eyes.
Shaking and very much afflicted, she looked at her uncommon husband,
Lord Siva, as if she were going to blast him with her vision.
PURPORT
The word apratipgrugsam, used in this verse, means one who has no
equal. Lord Siva has no equal in the material world in regard to equality
towards everyone. His wife, Sati, knew that her husband was equal towards
everyone, so why in this case was he so unkind to his wife that he did not
allow her to go to her father’s house? This distressed her more than she
could tolerate, and she looked at her husband as if she were ready to blast
him with her vision. In other words, since Lord Siva is the atma (888৫ also
means atma), it is indicated here that Sali was prepared lo commit
suicide. Another meaning of the word apratipurusa is the personality who
has no rival. Since Lord Siva could not be persuaded to give her permission,
Sati took shelter of a woman’s last weapon, weeping, which forces a
husband to agree to the proposal of his wife.

TRANSLATION
Thereafter Sati left her husband, Lord Siva, who had given her half his
body due to affection, and breathing very heavily because of anger and
bereavement, she went to the house of her father. This less intelligent act
was due to her being a weak woman.
PURPORT
According to the-Vedic conception of family life, the husband gives half
his body to his wife, and the wife gives half of her body to her husband. In
other words, a husband without a wife or a wife without a husband is in-
complete. The Vedic marital relationship existed between Lord Siva and
Sati, but sometimes, due to weakness, a woman becomes very attracted by
the members of her father’s house, and this happened to Sati. In this verse
it is specifically mentioned that she wanted to leave such a great husband
as Siva because of her womanly weakness. In other words, womanly
weakness exists even in the relationship between husband and wife.
Generally separation between husband and wife is due to womanly
behavior; divorce takes place due to womanly weakness. The best course
for a woman is to abide by the orders of her husband. That makes family
life very peaceful. Sometimes there may be misunderstandings between


--- Page 110 ---
112 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 4
husband and wife, as found even in such an elevated family relationship as
that of Sati and Lord Siva, but a wife should not leave her husband’s
protection because of such a misunderstanding. If she does so, it is
understood to be due to her womanly weakness.

TRANSLATION
When they saw Sati leaving alone very rapidly, thousands of Lord Sivas
disciples headed by Maniman and Mada quickly followed her with his bull
Nandi in front and accompanied by the Yaksas.
PURPORT
Sati was going very fast so that she might not be checked by her hushand,
but she was immediately followed by the many thousands of disciples of
Lord Siva, headed by Yaksas, Maniman and Mada. The word gata-vyathah,
used in this connection, means without fear. Sati did not care that she was
going alone; therefore she was almost fearless. The word anucardh is also
significant, for it indicates that Lord Siva’s disciples were always ready to
sacrifice anything for Lord Siva. All of them could understand the desire
of Siva, who did not want Sati to go alone. Anucarah means those who
can immediately understand the purpose of their master.

bugles, the entire procession was as pompous as a royal parade.

TRANSLATION

She then reached her father’s house where the sacrifice was being
performed and entered the arena where everyone was chanting the Vedic
hymns. The great sages, brahmanas and demigods were all assembled
there, and there were many sacrificial animals as well as pots made of
clay, stone, gold, glass and skin, which were all requisite for the sacrifice.

PURPORT

When learned sages and brahmanas assemble to chant Vedic mantras,
some of them also engage in arguing about the conclusion of the scriptures.
Thus some of the sages and brahmanas were arguing, and some of them
were chanting the Vedic mantras, so the entire atmosphere was surcharged
with transcendental sound vibration. This transcendental sound vibration
has been simplified in the transcendental vibration Hare Krsna, Hare
Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama,
Hare Hare. In this age, no one is expected to be highly educated in the
Vedic ways of understanding because people are very slow, lazy and
unfortunate. Therefore Lord Caitanya has recommended the sound
vibration Hare Krsna, and in the Srimad-Bhagavatam it is also reccommended:
yajiiaih sankirtana-prayair yajanti hi sumedhasah (Bhag. 11.5.32). At
the present moment it is impossible to gather sacrificial necessities because
of the poverty of the population and their lack of knowledge in Vedic
mantras. Therefore for this age it is recommended that people should
gather together and chant the Hare Krsna mantra to satisfy the Supreme
Personality of Godhead who is accompanied by His associates. Indirectly
this indicates Lord Caitanya, who is accompanied by His associates
Nityananda, Advaita and others. That is the process of performing yajiia
in this age.

Another significant point in the verse is that there were animals for
sacrifice. That these animals were meant for sacrifice does not mean that
they were meant to be killed. There were great sages and realized souls
assembled who were performing yajiias, and their realization was tested
by animal sacrifice, just as, in modern science, tests are made on animals
to determine the effectiveness of a particular medicine. The brahmanas
who were entrusted with the performance of yajia were very realized


--- Page 113 ---
Text 7] Sati Quits Her Body 115
souls, and to test their realization an old animal was offered in the fire and
again rejuvenated. That was the test of a Vedic mantra. The animals
gathered were not meant to be killed and eaten. The real purpose of a
sacrifice was not to replace a slaughterhouse but to test a Vedic mantra by
giving an animal new life. Animals were used to test the power of Vedic
mantras, not for meat.

TRANSLATION
When Sati, with her followers, reached the arena, because all the people
assembled were afraid of Daksa, none of them received her well. No one
welcomed her but her mother and sisters, who, with tears in their eyes
and with glad faces, welcomed her and talked with her very pleasingly.
PURPORT
The mother and sisters of Sati could not follow the others, who did not
receive Sati very well. Due to natural affection, they immediately
embraced her with tears in their eyes and with loving feelings. This shows
that women as a class are very softhearted; their natural affection and
love cannot be checked by artificial means. Although the men present
were very learned brihmanas and demigods, they were afraid of their


--- Page 114 ---
116 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 4
superior, Daksa, and because they knew that their welcoming Sati would
displease him, although in their minds they wanted to receive her, they
could not do so. Women are naturally softhearted, but men are some-
times very hardhearted.

TRANSLATION
Although she was received by her sisters and mother, she did not reply
to their words of reception, and although she was offered a seat and
presents, she did not accept anything because her father neither talked
with her nor welcomed her by asking about her welfare.
PURPORT
Sati did not accept the greetings offered by her sisters and mother
because she was not at all satisfied by her father’s silence. Sati was the
youngest child of Daksa, and she knew that she was his pet. But now,
pecause of her association with Lord Siva, Daksa forgot all his affection
for his daughter, which very much aggrieved her. The material bodily
conception is so polluted that even upon slight provocation all our rela-
tionships of love and affection are nullified. Bodily relationships are so
transient that even though one is affectionate towards someone in a
bodily relationship, a slight provocation terminates this intimacy.

TRANSLATION
Present in the arena of sacrifice, Sati saw that there were no oblations
for her husband, Lord Siva. Next she realized that not only did her father
fail to invite Lord Siva, but when he saw Lord Siva's exalted wife, Daksa
did not receive her either. Thus she became greatly angry, so much so that
she looked at her father as if she were going to burn him with her eyes.
PURPORT
By offering oblations in the fire while chanting the Vedic mantra svaha,
one offers respect to all the demigods, great sages, and pitrs, including
Lord Brahma, Lord Siva and Lord Visnu. It is customary that Siva is one
of those who are offered respects, but Sati, while personally present in the
arena, saw that the brahmanas did not utter the mantra offering oblations
to Lord Siva, namah $ivaya svaha. She was notsorry for herself, for she was
ready to come to her father’s house without being invited, but she
wanted to see whether or not her husband was being respected. To see her
relatives, her sisters and mother, was not so important; even when she was
received by her mother and sisters she did not care, for she was most con-
cerned that her husband was being insulted in the sacrifice. When she
marked the insult, she became greatly angry, and she looked at her father
so angrily that Daksa appeared to burn in her vision.

TRANSLATION
The followers of Lord Siva, the ghosts, were ready to injure or kill
Daksa, but Sati stopped them by her order. She was very angry and
sorrowful, and in that mood she began to condemn the process of
sacrificial fruitive activities and persons who are very proud of such
unnecessary and troublesome sacrifices. She especially condemned her
father, speaking against him in the presence of all.
PURPORT
The process of offering sacrifices is especially meant to satisfy Visnu,
who is called Yajiiesa because He is the enjoyer of the fruits of all
sacrifice. Bhagavad-gita also confirms this fact. The Lord says, 01১01827072
yajiia-tapasam (Bg. 5.29). He is the actual beneficiary of all sacrifices.
Not knowing this fact, less intelligent men offer sacrifices for some
material benefit. To derive personal material benefit for sense gratification
is the reason persons like Daksa and his followers perform sacrifices.
Such sacrifices are condemned here as a labor of love without actual
profit. This is confirmed in Srimad-Bhdgavatam. One may prosecute the
Vedic injunctions of offering sacrifices and other fruitive activities, but if
by such activities one does not develop attraction for Visnu, they are
useless labors. One who has developed love for Visnu must develop love

and respect for Vignu’s devotees. Lord Siva is considered the foremost
personality amongst the Vaisnavas. Vaisnavandam yatha sambhuh. Thus
when Sati saw that her father was performing great sacrifices but had no
respect for the greatest devotee, Lord Siva, she was very angry. This is
fitting; when Visnu or a Vaisnava is insulted, one should be angry. Lord
Caitanya, who always preached nonviolence, meekness and humility, also
became angry when Nityananda was offended by Jagai and Madhai, and
He wanted to kill them. When Visnu or a Vaisnava is blasphemed or dis-
honored, one should be very angry. Narottama dasa Thakur said, krodha
bhakta dvest jane. We have anger, and that anger can be a great quality when
directed against a person who is envious of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead or His devotee. One should not be tolerant when a person is
offensive towards Visnu or a Vaisnava. The anger of Sati towards her
father was not objectionable, for although he was her father, still he was
trying to insult the greatest Vaignava. Thus ৩৪015 anger against her father
was quite applaudable.

TRANSLATION

The blessed goddess said: Lord Siva is the most beloved of all living
entities. He has no rival. No one is very dear to him, and no one is his
enemy. No one but yourself could be envious of such a universal being,
who is free from all enmity.

PURPORT

In Bhagavad-gita (Bg. 9.29) the Lord says, samo ‘hari sarva-bhutesu:
“I am equal to all living entities.” Similarly, Lord Siva is a qualitative
incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, so he has almost
the same qualities as Him. Therefore he is equal to everyone; no one is
his enemy, and no one is his friend, but one who is envious by nature
can become the enemy of Lord Siva. Therefore Sati accused her father,
“No one but you could be envious of Lord Siva or could be his enemy.”
There were other sages and learned brahmanas present, but they were not
envious of Lord Siva, although they were all dependent on Daksa. There-
fore no one but Daksa could be envious of Lord Siva. That was the
accusation of ও ৪0.

qualities, but if someone has a little good quality, he magnifies it greatly.
Unfortunately you have found fault with such a great soul.

PURPORT

King Daksa is addressed here by his daughter Sati as dvija, twice-born.
Twice-born refers to the higher classes of men, namely the brahmanas,
ksatriyas and vaisyas. In other words, dvija is not an ordinary man but one
who has studied the Vedic literature from a spiritual master and can dis-
criminate between good and bad. Therefore it is supposed that he under-
stands logic and philosophy. Sati, Daksa’s daughter, put before him sound
arguments. There are some highly qualified persons who only accept the
good qualities of others. Just as a bee is always interested in the honey in
the flower and does not consider the thorns and colors, highly qualified
persons, who are uncommon, accept only the good qualities of others, not
considering their bad qualities, whereas the common man can judge what
are good qualities and what are bad qualities.

Among the uncommonly good souls there are still gradations, and the best
good soul is one who accepts an insignificant asset of a person and magni-
fies that good quality. Lord Siva is also called Asutoga, which means one
who is satisfied very easily and who offers to any person the highest level
of benediction. For example, once a devotee of Lord Siva wanted the
benediction that whenever he touched someone on the head, that person’s
head would at once be separated from his trunk. Lord Siva agreed.
Although the benediction asked was not very commendable because the
devotee wanted to kill his enemy, Tord Siva considered his good quality in
worshiping and satisfying him, and he granted the benediction. Thus Lord
Siva accepted his bad qualities as magnificently good qualities. But Sati
accused her father, “You are just the opposite. Although Lord Siva has so
many good qualities and has no bad qualities at all, you have accepted him
as bad and found fault with him. Because of your accepting his good
qualities to be bad, instead of your becoming the most exalted soul you
have become the most fallen. A man becomes the greatest soul by
accepting the goodness of others’ qualities, but by unnecessarily consid-
ering others’ good qualities to be bad, you have become the lowest of the
fallen souls.”

TRANSLATION
It is not wonderful for persons who have accepted the transient material
body as the self to engage always in deriding great souls. Such envy on the
part of materialistic persons is very good because that is the way they fall
down. They arediminished by the dust of the feet of great personalities.
PURPORT
Everything depends on the strength of the recipient. For example, due
to the scorching sunshine many vegetables and flowers dry up, and many
grow luxuriantly. Thus it is the recipient that causes growth and dwin-
dling. Similarly, mahdpiirusa-pada-parnsubhih, the dust of the lotus feet
of great personalities, offers all good to the recipient, but the same dust
can also do harm. Those who are offenders at the lotus feet of a great
personality dry up; their godly qualities diminish. A great soul may
forgive offenses, but Krsna does not excuse offenses to the dust of his feet,
just as one can tolerate the scorching sunshine on his head but cannot
tolerate the scorching sunshine on his feet. An offender glides down more
and more; therefore naturally he continues to commit offenses at the feet
of the great soul. Offenses are generally committed by persons who
falsely identify with the impermanent body. King Daksa was deeply
engrossed in misconception because he identified the body with the soul.
He offended the lotus feet of Lord Siva because he thought that his body,
being the father of the body of Sati, was superior to Lord Siva’s. General-
ly, less intelligent men misidentify in that way, and they act on the bodily
concept of life. Thus they are subject to commit more and more offenses

Text 14] Sati Quits Her Body 123
at the lotus feet of great souls. One who has such a concept of life is con-
sidered to be in the class of animals like cows and asses.

TRANSLATION
Sati continued: My dear father, you are committing the greatest offense
by envying Lord Siva, whose very name, consisting of two syllables, $i and
va, purifies one of all sinful activities. His order is never neglected. Lord
Siva is always pure, and no one but yourself envies him.
PURPORT
Since Lord Siva is the greatest soul among the living entities within this
material world, his name, Siva, is very auspicious for persons who identify
the body with the soul. If such persons take shelter of Lord Siva, gradually
they will understand that they are not the material body but are spirit
soul. Siva means mangala, or auspicious. Within the body the soul is
auspicious. 41078 07012777572: “I am Brahman.” This realization is auspi-
cious. As long as one does not realize his identity as the soul, whatever he
does is inauspicious. Siva means auspicious, and devotees of Lord Siva
gradually come to the platform of spiritual identification, but that is not
all. Auspicious life begins from the point of spiritual identification. But
there are still more duties—one has to understand his relationship with the


--- Page 122 ---
124 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 4
Supreme Soul. If one is actually a devotee of Lord Siva, he comes to the
platform of spiritual realization, but if he is not intelligent enough, then he
stops at that point, only realizing that he is spirit soul (ahem brehmasmi).
If he is intelligent enough, however, he should continue to act in the way
of Lord Siva, for Lord Siva is always absorbed in the thought of Vasudeva.
As was previously explained, sattvarn visuddharh vasudeva-sabditam:
Lord Siva is always in meditation on the lotus feet of Vasudeva, Sri Krsna.
Thus the auspicious position of Lord Siva is realized if one takes to the
worship of Visnu because Lord Siva says in the Siva Purana that the top-
most worship is worship of Lord Visnu. Lord Siva is worshiped because he
is the greatest devotee of Lord Visnu. One should not, however, make the
mistake of considering Lord Siva and Lord Vignu to be on the same level.
That is also an atheistic idea. It is also enjoined in the Vaispaviya Purapa
that Visnu or Narayana is the exalted Supreme Personality of Godhead,
and no one should be compared to Him as equal, even Lord Siva or Lord
Brahma, not to speak of other demigods.

--- Page 123 ---
Text 16] Sati Quits Her Body 125
because of their engagement in thinking of his lotus feet, he also blesses
higher personalities who are seeking after brahmananda [transcendental
bliss].
PURPORT
Ordinarily there are two classes of men. One class, who are grossly
materialistic, want 1140 and their desires are fulfilled if they
worship Lord Siva. Lord Siva, being very quickly satisfied, satisfies the
material desires of the common man very quickly; therefore it is seen that
ordinary men are very much apt to worship him. Next, those who are
disgusted or frustrated with the materialistic way of life worship Lord
Siva to attain salvation, which entails freedom from material identification.
One who understands that he is not the material body but is spirit soul is
liberated from ignorance. Lord Siva also offers that facility. People
generally practice religion for economic development, to get some money,
for by getting money they can satisfy their senses. But when they are
frustrated they want spiritual brahmananda, or merging into the Supreme.
These four principles of material life—religion, economic development,
sense gratification and liberation—exist, and Lord Siva is the friend of both
the ordinary man and the man who is elevated in spiritual knowledge, so
it was not good for Daksa to create enmity towards him. Even Vaisnavas,
who are above both the ordinary and the elevated men in this world, also
worship Lord Siva as the greatest Vaisnava. Thus he is the friend of every-
one—the common men, the elevated men and the devotees of the Lord—so
no one should disrespect or create enmity towards Lord Siva.

TRANSLATION

Do you think that greater, more respectable personalities than you, such
as Lord Brahma, do not know this inauspicious person who goes under
the name of Lord Siva? He associates with the demons in the crematorium,
his locks of hair are scattered all over his body, he is garlanded with human
skulls and smeared with ashes from the crematorium, but in spite of all
these inauspicious qualities, great personalities like Brahma honor him by
accepting the flowers offered to his lotus feet and placing them with great
respect on their heads.

PURPORT

It is useless to condemn a great personality like Lord Siva, and this is
being stated by his wife, Sati, to establish the supremacy of her husband.
First she said, “You call Lord Siva inauspicious because he associates with
demons in crematoriums, covers his body with the ashes of the dead and
garlands himself with the skulls of human beings. You have shown so
many defects, but you do not know that his position is always transcen-
dental. Although he appears inauspicious, why do personalities like
Brahma respect the dust of his lotus feet and place on their heads with
great respect those very garlands which are condemned by you?” Since
Sati was a chaste woman and the wife of Lord Siva, it was her duty to
establish the elevated position of Lord Siva, not only by sentiment but by
facts. Lord Siva is not an ordinary living entity. This is the conclusion of
Vedic scripture. He is neither on the level of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead nor on the level of the ordinary living entities. Brahma is in
almost all cases an ordinary living entity. Sometimes, when there is no
ordinary living entity available, the post of Brahma is occupied by an
expansion of Lord Visnu, but generally this post is occupied by a greatly
pious living entity within this universe. Thus constitutionally Lord Siva’s
position is higher than that of Lord Brahma, although Lord Siva appeared
as the son of Brahma. Here it is mentioned that even personalities like
Brahma accept the so-called inauspicious flowers and the dust of the
lotus feet of Lord Siva. Great sages like Marici, Atri, Bhrgu and the other
nine great sages who are descendants of Brahma also respect Lord Siva in


--- Page 125 ---
Text 17] Safi Quits Her Body 127
such a way because they all know that Lord Siva is not an ordinary living
entity.

In many Puranas it is sometimes asserted that a demigod is elevated to
such a high position that he is almost on an equal level with the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, but the conclusion that Lord Vispu 15 the
Supreme Personality of Godhead is confirmed in every scripture. Lord
Siva is described in the Brahma-samhita to be like curd or yogurt. Curd is
not different from milk. Since milk is transformed into curd, in one sense
curd is also milk. Similarly, Lord Siva is in one sense the Supreme Personal-
ity of Godhead, but in another sense he is not, just as curd is milk
although we have to distinguish between the two. These descriptions are
in the Vedic literature. Whenever we find that a demigod occupies a
position apparently more elevated than that of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, it is just to draw the devotee’s attention to that particular
demigod. It is also stated in the Bhagavad-gita that if anyone wants to
worship a particular demigod, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who
is sitting in everyone’s heart, gives him greater and greater attachment for
that demigod so that he may be elevated to the demigod’s abode. Yanti
deva-vrata devan (Bg. 9.25). By worshiping demigods one can elevate
himself to the abodes of the demigods; similarly, by worshiping the
Supreme Personality of Godhead one can be elevated to the spiritual
kingdom. This is stated in different places in Vedic literature. Here Lord
Siva is praised by Sati, partially due to her personal respect for Lord Siva,
since he is her husband, and partially due to his exalted position, which
exceeds that of ordinary living entities, even Lord Brahma. The position
of Lord Siva is accepted by Lord Brahma, so Daksa, Sati’s father, should
also recognize him. That was the point of Sat’s statement. She did not
actually come to her father’s house to participate in the function, although
before coming she pleaded with her husband that she wanted to see her
sisters and her mother. That was a plea only, for actually at heart she
maintained the idea that she would convince her father, Daksa, that it
was useless to continue being envious of Lord Siva. That was her main
purpose. When she was unable to convince her father, she gave up the
body he had given her, as will be seen in the following verses.

TRANSLATION
Sati continued: If one hears an irresponsible person blaspheme the
master and controller of religion, he should block his ears and go away
if he is unable to punish him. But if one is able to kill, then one should
by force cut out the blasphemer’s tongue and kill the offender, and
after that he should give up his own life.
PURPORT
The argument offered by Sati is that a person who vilifies a great
personality is the lowest of all creatures. But, by the same argument,
Daksa could also defend himself by saying that since he was a Prajapati,
the master of many living creatures and one of the great officers of the
great universal affairs, his position was so exalted that Sati should accept
his good qualities instead of vilifying him. The answer to that argument is
that Sati was not vilifying but defending. If possible she should have cut
out Daksa’s tongue because he blasphemed Lord Siva. In other words,
since Lord Siva is the protector of religion, a person who vilifies him
should be killed at once, and after killing such a person, one should give
up his life. That is the process, but because Daksa happened to be the
father of Sati, she decided not to kill him but to give up her own life in
order to compensate for the great sin that she had committed by hearing
blasphemy of Lord Siva. The instruction set forth here in Srimad-
Bhagavatam is that one should not tolerate at any cost the activities of a
person who vilifies or blasphemes an authority. If one is a brahmana he


--- Page 127 ---
Text 18] Safi Quits Her Body 129
should not give up his body because by doing so he would be responsible
for killing a brahmana; therefore a brahmapa should leave the place or
block his ears so that he will not hear the blasphemy. If one happens to be
a ksatriya he has the power to punish any man; therefore a ksatriya should
at once cut out the tongue of the vilifier and kill him. But as far as the
vaiSyas and Siidras are concerned, they should immediately give up their
bodies. Sat decided to give up her body because she thought herself to be
among the sidras and vaiSyas. As slated in Bhagavad-gita, striyo vaisyas
tatha Sudrah (Bg. 9.32). Women, laborers and the mercantile class are on
the same level. Thus since it is recommended that vai§yas and $iidras
should immediately give up their bodies upon hearing blasphemy of an
exalted person like Lord Siva, she decided to give up her life.

TRANSLATION
It is better to execute one’s own occupational duty than to criticize
others. Those who are elevated transcendentalists sometimes may not
observe the rules and regulations of the Vedas, since they do not need to
follow them, just as the demigods travel in space whereas ordinary men
travel on the surface of the earth.
PURPORT
The behavior of the most elevated transcendentalist and that of the
most fallen conditioned soul appear to be the same. The elevated transcen-
dentalist can surpass all the regulations of the Vedas, just as the demigods
traveling in space surpass all the jungles and rocks on the surface of the
globe, although a common man who has no such ability to travel in space
has to face all those impediments. The most dear Lord Siva, although he
appeared not to observe all the rules and regulations of the Vedas, is not
affected by such disobedience, but a common man who wants to imitate


--- Page 129 ---
Text 20] Sati Quits Her Body 131
Lord Siva is mistaken. A common man must observe all the rules and
regulations of the Fedas which a person who is in the transcendental
position does not need to observe. Daksa found fault with Lord Siva for
not observing all the strict rules and regulations of the Fedas, but Sati
asserted that he had no nced to observe such rules. It is said that
for one who is powerful like the sun or the fire, there is no considera
tion of purity or impurity. The sunshine can sterilize an impure place,
whereas if someone else were to pass such a place he would be affected.
One should not try to imitate Lord Siva; rather, one should strictly
follow his prescribed occupational duties. One should never vilify
a great personality like Lord Siva.

TRANSLATION
In the Vedas there are directions for two kinds of activities—activities
for those who are attached to material enjoyment and activities for those
who are materially detached. In consideration of these two kinds of
activities, there are two kinds of people, who have different symptoms.
If one wants to see two kinds of activities in one person, that is contradic-
tory. But both kinds of activities may be neglected by a person who is
transcendentally situated.

132 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 4
PURPORT
The Vedic activities are so designed that the conditioned soul who has
come to enjoy the material world may do so under direction so that at the
end he becomes detached from such material enjoyment and is eligible to
enter into the transcendental position. The four different social orders—
brahmacari, grhastha, vanaprastha and sannyasa—gradually train a person to
come to the platform of transcendental life. The activities and dress of a
grhastha or householder are different from those of a sannyasi, one in the
renounced order of life. It is impossible for one person to adopt both
orders. A sannyasi cannot act like a householder, nor can ahouseholder act
like a sannyasi, but above these two kinds of persons, one who engages in
material activities and one who has renounced material activities, there is
the person who is transcendental to both. Lord Siva was in the transcen-
dental position because, as stated before, he was always absorbed in the
thought of Lord Vasudeva within himself. Therefore neither the activities
of the grhastha nor those of the sannyast in the renounced order can be
applicable for him. He is in the paramaharisa stage, the highest perfectional
stage of life. The transcendental position of Lord Siva is also explained in
Bhagavad-gita, Second Chapter, verses 52 and 53. It is stated there that
when one fully engages in transcendental service of the Lord by performing
activities without fruitive results, one is elevated to the transcendental
position. At that time he has no obligation to follow the Vedic injunctions
or the different rules and regulations of the Vedas. When one is above the
directions of the Vedic ritualistic injunctions for attaining different allure-
ments and is fully absorbed in transcendental thought, which means
thought of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in devotional service,
that position is called buddhi-yoga, or samadhi, ecstasy. For a person who
has attained this stage, neither the Vedic activities for realizing material
enjoyment nor those for renunciation are applicable.

TRANSLATION

My dear father, the opulence which we possess is impossible either for
you or for your flatterers to imagine because persons who engage in
fruitive activities by performing great sacrifices are concerned with satis-
fying their bodily necessities by eating foodstuff offered as a sacrifice.
We can exhibit our opulences simply by desiring to do so. This can be
achieved only by great personalities who are renounced self-realized souls.

PURPORT

58175 father was under the impression that he was exalted in both
prestige and opulence and that he had offered his daughter to a person
who was not only poor but devoid of all culture. Her father might have
been thinking that although she was a chaste woman, greatly adherent to
her husband, her husband was in a deplorable condition. To counteract
such thoughts, Sati said that the opulence possessed by her husband could
not be understood by materialistic persons like Daksa and his followers,
who were flatterers and were engaged in fruitive activities. Her husband’s
position was different. He possessed all opulences, but he did not like to
exhibit them. Therefore such opulences are called avyakta, or unmani-
fested. But if required, simply by willing, Lord Siva can show his wonder-
ful opulences, and such an event is predicted here, for it would soon occur.
The opulence which Lord Siva possesses is enjoyable in renunciation and
love of God, not in material exhibition of sense gratificatory methods.
Such opulences are possessed by personalities like the Kumaras, Narada
and Lord Siva, not by others. In this verse the performers of the Vedic
rituals are condemned. They have been described here as dhima-
vartmabhih, those who maintain themselves on the remnants of
sacrificial foodstuff. There are two kinds of foodstuff offered in sacrifice.
One kind is food offered in fruitive ritualistic sacrifices, and the other, the
best, is food offered to Vispu. Although in all cases Visnu is the chief


--- Page 132 ---
134. Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 4
Deity on the sacrificial altar, the performers of fruitive rituals aim to
satisfy various demigods to achieve in return some material prosperity.
Real sacrifice, however, is to satisfy Lord Visnu, and the remnants of such
sacrifices are beneficial for advancement in devotional service. The process
of elevation by performing sacrifices other than those aimed at Visnu is
very slow, and therefore it has been condemned in this verse. Visvanatha
Cakravarti has described the ritualistic performers to be like crows because
crows delight in eating the remnants of food which has been thrown into
the dustbin. All the brahmanas who were present for the sacrifice were
also condemned by Sati.

Whether or not King Daksa and his flatterers could understand the
position of Lord Siva, Sati wanted to impress upon her father that he
should not think her husband to be without opulence. Sati, being the
devoted wife of Lord Siva, offers all kinds of material opulences to the
worshipers of Lord Siva. This fact is explained in the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
in the Tenth Canto. Lord Siva’s worshipers sometimes appear to be more
opulent than the worshipers of Lord Visnu because Durga, or Sati, being
the superintendent in charge of material affairs, can offer all material
opulences to the worshipers of Lord Siva in order to glorify her husband,
but the worshipers of Visnu are meant for spiritual elevation, and therefore
their material opulence is sometimes found to decrease. These points are
very nicely discussed in the Tenth Canto.

TRANSLATION
You are an offender at the lotus feet of Lord Siva, and unfortunately 1
have a body produced from yours. I am very much ashamed of our bodily
relationship, and 1 condemn myself because my body is contaminated by a
relationship with a person who is an offender at the lotus feet of the
greatest personality.
PURPORT
Lord Siva is the greatest of all devotees of Lord Vignu. It is stated,
vaispavanam yatha $sambhuh. Sambhu, Lord Siva, is the greatest of all
devotees of Lord Vispu. In the previous verses Sati has described that
Lord Siva is always in a transcendental position because he is situated in
pure vasudeva. Vasudeva is the state from which Krsna, Vasudeva, is born,
so Lord Siva is the greatest devotee of Lord Krsna, and Sati’s behavior is
exemplary because no one should tolerate blasphemy against Lord Visnu
or His devotee. Sati is aggrieved not for her personal association with Lord
Siva but because her body is related with that of Daksa, who is an offender
at Lord Siva’s lotus feet. She feels herself to be condemned because of the
body given by her father, Daksa.

Daksayani 1 at once become morose, and my jolliness and my smile at
once disappear. 1 feel very much sorry that my body, which is just like a
bag, has been produced by you, and I shall therefore give it up.
PURPORT
The word daksayani means the daughter of King Daksa. Sometimes,
when there was relaxed conversation between husband and wife, Lord
Siva used to call Sati the daughter of King Daksa, and because this very
word reminded her about her family relationship with King Daksa, she at
once became ashamed because Daksa is an incarnation of all offenses.
Daksa is the embodiment of envy, for he unnecessarily blasphemed a great
personality, Lord Siva. Simply upon hearing the word daksayapi, she felt
afflicted because of reference to the context because her body was the
symbol of all the offensiveness with which Daksa was endowed. Since her
body was constantly a source of unhappiness, she decided to give it up.

Text 25] Sati Quits Her Body 137
TRANSLATION
Maitreya the sage told Vidura: O annihilator of enemies, while thus
speaking to her father in the arena of sacrifice, Sati sat down on the
ground and faced north. Dressed in saffron garments, she sanctified
herself with water and closed her eyes to absorb herself in the mystic yoga
process.
PURPORT
It is said thal when a man desires to quit his body he dresses in saffron
garments. Therefore it appears that Sati changed her dress, indicating that
she was going to quit the body given her by Daksa. Daksa was Sati’s
father, so instead of killing Daksa she decided that it would be better to
destroy the part of his body which was hers. Thus she decided to give up
the body of Daksa by the yogic process. Sat was the wife of Lord Siva,
who is known as Yogesvara, the best among all yogis, because he knows
all the mystic processes of yoga, so it appeared that Sati also knew them.
Either she learned yoga from her husband or she was enlightened because
she was the daughter of such a great king as Daksa. The perfection of yoga
is that one can give up his body or release himself from the embodiment
of material elements according to one’s desire. Yogis who have attained
perfection are not subject to death by natural laws; such perfect yogis can
leave the body whenever they desire. Generally the yogi first of all
becomes mature in controlling the air passing within the body, thus
bringing the soul to the top of the brain. Then when the body bursts into
flames, the yogi can go anywhere he likes. This yoga system recognizes the
soul, and thus it is distinct from the so-called yoga process for controlling
the cells of the body which has been discovered in the modern age. The
real yoga process accepts the transmigration of the soul from one planet
to another or one body to another; and it appears from this incidence tha!
Sati wanted to transfer her soul to another body or sphere.

TRANSLATION

First of all she sat in the required sitting posture, and then she carried
the life air upwards and placed it in the position of equilibrium near the
navel. Then she raised her life air, mixed with intelligence, to the heart and
then gradually raised it towards the pulmonary passage and from there to
between her eyebrows.

PURPORT

The yogic process is to control the air passing within the body in
different places called sat-cakra, the six circles of air circulation. The
air is raised from the abdomen to the navel, from the navel to the heart,
from the heart to the throat, from the throat to between the eyebrows
and from between the eyebrows to the top of the cerebrum. That is the
sum and substance of practicing yoga. Before practicing the real yoga
system one has to practice the sitting postures because this helps in the
breathing exercises which control the airs going upwards and downwards.
This is a great technique which one has to practice to attain the highest
perfectional stage of yoga, but such practice is not meant for this age.
No one in this age can attain the perfectional stage of such yoga, but
people indulge in practicing sitting postures, which is more or less a
gymnastic process. By such bodily gymnastics one may develop good
circulation and may therefore keep his body fit, but if one simply
restricts oneself to that gymnastic process one cannot attain the highest
perfectional stage. The yoga process, as described in the Kesava-sruti, pre-
scribes how one can control his living force according to his desire and
transmigrate from one body to another or from one place to another.
In other words, yoga practice is not meant to keep the body fit because
any transcendental process of spiritual realization automatically helps one


--- Page 137 ---
Text 26] Sati Quits Her Body 139
to keep the body fit, for it is the spirit soul that keeps the body always
fresh. As soon as the spirit soul is out of the body, the material body
immediately begins to decompose. Any spiritual process keeps the body
fit without separate endeavor, but if one takes it that the ultimate aim of
yoga is to maintain the body, then he is mistaken. The real perfection of
yoga is elevation of the soul to a higher position or the liberation of the
soul from material entanglement. Some yogis try to elevate the soul to
higher planetary systems where the standard of life is different from that
of this planet and where the material comforts, life span and other facilities
for self-realization are greater, and some yogis endeavor to elevate the soul
to the spiritual world, the spiritual Vaikuntha planets. The bhakti-yoga
process directly elevates the soul to the spiritual planets where life is
eternally blissful and full of knowledge; therefore bhakti-yoga is consid-
ered to be the greatest of all yoga systems.

Thus, in order to give up her body, which had been so respectfully and

sages and saints, Sati, due to anger towards her father, began to meditate
on the fiery air within the body.


--- Page 138 ---
140 Srimad-Bhagavatam | Canto 4, Ch. 4
PURPORT
Lord Siva is described herein as the best of all great souls. Although
Sati’s body was born of Daksa, Lord Siva used to adore her by sitting her
on his lap. This is considered a great token of respect. Thus Sati’s body
was not ordinary, but still she decided to give it up because it was the
source of unhappiness because of its connection with Daksa. This severe
example set by Sali is to be followed. One should be extremely careful
about associating with persons who are not respectful to the higher
authorities. It is instructed, therefore, in the Vedic literature that one
should always be free from the association of atheists and nondevolees
and should try to associate with devotees, for by the association of a
devotee one can be elevated to the platform of self-realization. This
injunction is stressed in many places in Srimad-Bhagavatam; if one wants
to be liberated from the clutches of material existence, then one has to
associate with great souls, and if one wants to continue one’s material
existential life, then one can associate with persons who are materialistic.
The materialistic way of life is based on sex life. Thus both becoming
addicted to sex life and associating with persons who are addicted to sex
life are condemned in the Vedic literature because such association will
simply interfere with one’s spiritual progress. However, association with
great personalities, devotees who are great souls, will elevate one to the
spiritual platform. Satidevi decided to quit the body which she had
obtained from Daksa’s body, and she wanted to transfer herself to
another body so that she might have completely uncontaminated associa-
tion with Lord Siva. Of course it is understood that in her next life she
would take birth as the daughter of the Himalayas, Parvati, and then she
would again accept Lord Siva as her husband. Sati and Lord Siva are
eternally related; even after she changes her body their relationship is
never broken.

TRANSLATION

Sati concentrated all her meditation on the holy lotus feet of her
husband, Lord Siva, who is the supreme spiritual master of all the world,
and thus she became completely cleansed of all taints of sin and quit her
body in a blazing fire by meditation on the fiery elements.

PURPORT

Sati at once thought of the lotus feet of her husband, Lord Siva, who is
one of the three great personalities of Godhead in charge of the manage-
ment of the material world, and simply by meditating on his lotus fect she
derived such great pleasure that she forgot everything in relationship with
her body. This pleasure was certainly material because she gave up her
body for another body that was also material, but by this example we
can appreciate the devotee’s pleasure in concentrating his mind and
attention on the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, Visnu or Krsna. There is
such transcendental bliss in simply meditating on the lotus feet of the
Lord that 0110 can forget everything but the Lord’s transcendental form.
This is the perfection of yogic samadhi or ecstasy. In this verse it is stated
that by such meditation she became free from all contamination. What
was that contamination? The contamination was her concept of the body
derived from Daksa, bul she forgot that bodily relationship in trance. The
purport is that when one becomes free from all bodily relationships within
this material world and simply places himself in the position of an eternal
servant of the Supreme Lord, it is to be understood that all the contamina-
tion of his material attachment has been burnt by the blazing fires of
transcendental ecstasy. It is not necessary for one to manifest a blazing
fire externally, for if one forgets all his bodily relationships within this
material world and becomes situated in his spiritual identity, it is said
that one has been freed from all material contamination by the blazing
fire of yogic samadhi or ecstasy. That is the topmost perfection of yoga.
If one keeps his bodily relationships within this material world and poses
himself as a great yogi, he 18 not a bona fide yogi. In Srimed-Bhagavatam,
Second Canto, it is stated, yatl-kirtanam yal-smaraparn (01৫8. 2.4.15).


--- Page 140 ---
142 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 4
Simply by chanting the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
simply by remembering the lotus feet of Krsna, simply by offering prayers
to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one is immediately freed from
material contamination, the material bodily concept, by the blazing fire
of ecstasy. This effect takes place immediately, without a second’s delay.
According to Sri Jiva Gosvami, that Sati quit her body means that she
gave up within her heart her relationship with Daksa. Sri Viévanatha
Cakravarti Thakur also comments that since Sati is the superintendent
deity of the external potency, when she quit her body she did not get a
spiritual body but simply transferred from the body she had received from
Daksa. Other commentators also say that she immediately transferred
herself into the womb of Menaka, her future mother. She gave up the
body she had received from Daksa and immediately transferred herself to
another, better body, but this does not mean that she got a spiritual body.

Text 29] Sati Quits Her Body 143
PURPORT
There was a tumultuous roaring all over the universe in the societies of
the demigods of different planets because Sati was the daughter of Daksa,
the greatest of all kings, and the wife of Lord Siva, the greatest of all
demigods. Why did she become so angry that she gave up her body?
Since she was the daughter of a great personality and wife of a great
personality, she had nothing to desire, but still she gave up her body in
dissatisfaction. Certainly this was astonishing. One cannot attain complete
satisfaction even if one is situated in the greatest material opulence. There
was nothing Sati could not achieve either from her relationship with her
father or from her relationship with the greatest of the demigods, but still,
for some reason, she was dissatisfied. Therefore, Srimad-Bhagavatam
explains that one has to achieve real satisfaction, but (yeydtma
samprasidati) atma—the body, mind and soul—all become completely satis-
fied only if one develops devotional service to the Absolute Truth. Sa vai
0५0750५ paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhoksaje. Adhoksaja means the
Absolute Truth. If one can develop his unflinching love for the transcen-
dental Supreme Personality of Godhead, that can give complete satisfac-
tion, otherwise there is no possibility of satisfaction in the material world
or anywhere else.

TRANSLATION
It was astonishing that Daksa, who was prajapati, the maintainer of all
living entities, was so disrespectful to his own daughter, Sati, who was not
only chaste but was also a great soul, that she gave up her body because of
his neglect.
PURPORT
The word andtmya is significant. Anatmya means the life of the soul, so
this word indicates that although Daksa appeared to be living, actually he
was a dead body, otherwise how could he neglect Sati, who was his own
daughter? It was the duty of Daksa to look after the maintenance and
comforts of all living entilies because he was situated as prajapati, the
governor of all living entities. Therefore how is it that he neglected his
own daughter, who was the most exalted and chaste woman, a great soul,
and who therefore deserved the most respectful treatment from her
father? The death of Sati because of her being neglected by Daksa, her
father, was most astonishing to all the great demigods of the universe.

daughter, because of not having prevented her death, and because of his
great envy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
PURPORT

Daksa is described here as most hardhearted and therefore unqualified
to be a brahmana. Brahma-dhruk is described by some commentators to
mean brahma-bandhu, or friend of the brahmanas. A person who is born in
a brahmapa family but has no brahminical qualifications is called a
brahma-bandhu. Brahmanas are generally very softhearted and forbearing
because they have the power to control the senses and the mind. Daksa,
however, was not forbearing. For the simple reason that his son-in-law,
Lord Siva, did not stand up to show him the formality of respect, he
became so angry and hardhearted that he tolerated even the death of his
dearest daughter. Sati tried her best to mitigate the misunderstanding
between the son-in-law and the father-in-law by coming to her father’s
house, even without an invitation, and at that time Daksa should have
received her, forgetting all past misunderstandings. But he was so hard-
hearted that he was unworthy to be called an aryan or brahmanpa. Thus his
ill fame still continues. Daksa means expert, and he was given this name
because of his ability to beget many hundreds and thousands of children.
Persons who are too sexually inclined and materialistic become so hard-
hearted because of a slight loss of prestige that they can tolerate even the
death of their children.

TRANSLATION
While people were talking among themselves about the wonderful
voluntary death of Sati, the attendants who came with her readied them-
selves to kill Daksa with their weapons.
PURPORT
The attendants who came with Sati were meant to protect her from
calamities, but since they were unable to protect their master’s wife, they
decided to die for her, and before dying they wanted to kill Daksa. It is
the duty of attendants to give protection to their master, and in case of
failure it is their duty to die.

TRANSLATION
They came forward forcibly, but Bhrgu Muni saw the danger and,
offering oblations into the southern side of the sacrificial fire, immediately
uttered mantric hymns from the Yajur-veda by which the destroyers of
yajiiik performances could be killed immediately.
PURPORT
Here is one example of powerful hymns in the Vedas which, when
chanted, could perform wonderful acts. In the present age of Kali it is not
possible to find expert mantra chanters; therefore all the sacrifices recom-
mended in the Vedas are forbidden in this age. The only sacrifice recom-
mended in this age is the chanting of the Hare Krsna mantra because in
this age it is not possible to accumulate the needed funds for performing

sacrifices, not to speak of finding expert brahmapas who can chant the
mantras perfectly.

TRANSLATION
When Bhrgu Muni offered oblations in the fire, immediately many
thousands of demigods named Rbhu became manifested. All of them were
powerful, having achieved strength from Soma, the moon.
PURPORT
It is stated here that many thousands of demigods named Rbhus
became manifested because of the oblations offered in the fire and the
chanting of the hymns from the Yajur-veda. Brahmapas like Bhrgu Muni
were so powerful that they could create such powerful demigods simply
by chanting the Vedic mantres. Vedic mantras are still available, but the
chanters are not. By chanting Vedic mantras or chanting the Gayatri or
Rg-mantra one can attain the results he desires. In the present age of Kali
it is recommended by Lord Caitanya that simply by chanting Hare Krsna
one can attain all perfection.

anah— being attacked; disah—in different directions; bhejuh—fled; usadbhih

TRANSLATION

When the Rbhu demigods attacked the ghosts and Guhyakas with
half-burned fuel from the yajiia fire, all these attendants of Sati fled in
different directions and disappeared. This was possible simply because of
brahma-tejah, brahminical power.

PURPORT

The word brahma-tejasa, used in this verse, is significant. In those days
brahmapas were so powerful that simply by desiring and by chanting
a Vedic mantra, they could accomplish very wonderful effects. But in the
present age of degradation there are no such brahmanas. According to the
Paiicaritrika system, in this age the entire population is supposed to con-
sist of siidras because the brahminical culture has been lost. But if anyone
displays the signs of understanding Krsna consciousness, he should be
accepted, according to Vaignava smyti regulations, as a prospective
brahmapa and should be given all facilities to achieve the highest perfec-
tion. The most magnanimous gift of lord Caitanya is that the highest
perfection of life is available in this fallen age if one simply adopts the
process of chanting Hare Krsna, which is able to bring about the fulfill-
ment of all activities in self-realization.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fourth Canto, Fourth
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “Sati Quits Her Body.”

Maitreya said: When Lord Siva heard from Narada that Sati, his wife,
was now dead because of Prajapati Daksa’s insult to her and that his
soldiers had been driven away by the Rbhu demigods, he became greatly
angry.
PURPORT
Lord Siva understood that Sati, being the youngest daughter of Daksa,
could present the case of Lord Siva’s purity of purpose and thus would be
149


--- Page 148 ---
150 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 5
able to mitigate the misunderstanding between Daksa and himself. But
such a compromise was not attained, and Sati was deliberately insulted by
her father by not being received properly when she visited his house
without being invited. Sati herself could have killed her father, Daksa,
because she is the personified material energy and has immense power to
kill and create within this material universe. In the Brahma-sarmmhita her
strength is described: she is capable of creating and dissolving many
universes. But although she is so powerful, she acts under the direction of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, as His shadow. It would not
have been very difficult for Sati to punish her father, but she thought that
since she was his daughter, it was not proper for her to kill him. Thus she
decided to give up her own body, which she had obtained from his, and
Daksa did not even check her.

When Sati passed away, giving up her body, the news was conveyed by
Narada to Lord Siva. Narada always carries the news of such events
because he knows their import. When Lord Siva heard that his chaste wife
Satl was dead, he naturally became exceedingly angry. He also understood
that Bhrgu Muni had created the Rbhudeva demigods by uttering the
mantras of the Yajur-veda and that these demigods had driven away all of
his soldiers who were present in the arena of the sacrifice. Therefore, he
wanted to reply to this insult, and thus he decided to kill Daksa because he
was the cause of the death of Sati.

TRANSLATION

When that gigantic demon asked with folded hands, “What shall 1
do, my lord?” Lord Siva, who is known as Bhiitanatha, directly ordered,
“Because you are born from my body, you are the chief of all my asso-
ciates. Therefore, kill Daksa and his soldiers at the sacrifice.”

PURPORT

Here is the beginning of competition between brahma-tejas and
Siva-tejas. Bhrgu Muni had created the Rbhu demigods, who had driven
away the soldiers of Lord Siva stationed in the arena, by his brahma-tejas,
brahminical strength. When Lord Siva heard that his soldiers had been
driven away, he created the tall black demon Virabhadra to retaliate.
There is sometimes a competition between the mode of goodness and the
mode of ignorance. That is the way of material existence. Even when one
is situated in the mode of goodness, there is every possibility that his
position will be mixed with or attacked by the modes of passion or
ignorance. That is the law of material nature. Although pure goodness, or
Suddha-sattva, is the basic principle in the spiritual world, pure manifesta-
tion of goodness is not possible in this material world. Thus, the struggle
for existence between different material qualities is always present. This
quarrel between Lord Siva and Bhrgu Muni, centering around Prajapati
Daksa, is the practical example of such competition between the different
qualitative modes of material nature.

anxiety.

TRANSLATION

Conjecturing on the origin of the storm, they said: There is no wind
blowing, and there are no cows passing, nor is it possible that this dust
storm could be raised by plunderers because still there is the strong King
Barhi, who would punish them. Where is this dust storm blowing from? Is
the dissolution of this planet now to occur?

PURPORT

Specifically significant in this verse is pracinabarhir jivati. The king of
that part of the land was known as Barhi, and although he was old, he was
still living, and he was a very strong ruler. Thus there was no possibility of
thieves and plunderers invading. Indirectly it is stated here that thieves,
plunderers, rogues and unwanted population can exist only in a state or
kingdom where there is no strong ruler. When, in the name of justice,
thieves are allowed liberty, the state and kingdom are disturbed by such
plunderers and unwanted population. The dust storm created by the
soldiers and assistants of Lord Siva resembled the situation at the time of
the dissolution of this world. When there is a need for the dissolution of
the material creation, this function is conducted by Lord Siva. Therefore
the situation now created by him resembled the dissolution of the cosmic
manifestation.

Prasiti, the wife of Daksa, along with the other women assembled,
became very anxious and said: This danger has been created by Daksa
because of the death of Sati, who, even though completely innocent, quit
her body as her sisters looked on.
PURPORT
एण्ड, being a softhearted woman, could immediately understand
that the imminent danger approaching was due to the impious activity
of hardhearted Prajapati Daksa. He was so cruel that he would not save
her youngest daughter, Sati, from the action of committing suicide in the
presence of her sisters. Sati’s mother could understand how much Sati had
been pained by the insult of her father. She had been present along with
the other daughters, and Daksa had purposely received all of them but
her because she happened to be the wife of Lord Siva. This consideration
convinced the wife of Daksa of the danger which was now ahead, and thus
she knew that Daksa must be prepared to die for his heinous action.

At the time of dissolution, Lord Siva’s hair is scattered, and he pierces
the rulers of the different directions with his trident. He laughs and dances
proudly, scattering their hands like flags, as thunder scatters the clouds all
over the world.
PURPORT
Prasiiti, who appreciated the power and strength of her son-in-law,
Lord Siva, is describing what he does at the time of dissolution. This
description indicates that the strength of Lord Siva is so great that Daksa’s
power could not be set in comparison to it. At the time of dissolution,
Lord Siva, with his trident in hand, dances over the rulers of the different
planets, and his hair is scattered, just as the clouds are scattered over all
directions in order to plunge the different planets into incessant torrents
of rain. In the last phase of dissolution, all the planets become inun-
dated with water, and that inundation is caused by the dancing of
Lord Siva. This dance is called the pralaya dance, or dance of dissolution.
Prasiiti could understand that the dangers ahead resulted not only from
Daksa’s neglecting her rip. Sore but also because of his neglecting the
prestige and honor of Lord Siva.

Viraraghavacarya has indicated that this word mahatma means steady in
heart. That is to say that Daksa was so stronghearted that even when his
beloved daughter was prepared to lay down her life, he was steady and
unshaken. But in spite of his being so stronghearted, he was perturbed
when he saw the various disturbances created by the giganfic black demon.
Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakur remarks in this connection that even if one
is called mahatma, a great soul, unless he exhibits the symptoms of a
mahatma, he should be considered a duratma, or a degraded soul. In
Bhagavad-gita the word mahatma describes the pure devotee of the Lord:
mahatmanas tu mam partha daivir prakrtim asritah (Bg. 9.13). A mehatma
is always under the guidance of the internal energy of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, and thus how could such a misbehaved person as
Daksa be a mahatma? A mahatma is supposed to have all the good
qualities of the demigods, and thus Daksa, lacking those qualities, could
not be called a mahatma; he should instead be called duratma, a degraded
soul. The word mahatma to describe the qualifications of Daksa is used
sarcastically.

My dear Vidura, all the followers of Lord Siva surrounded the arena of
sacrifice. They were of short stature and were equipped with various kinds
of weapons; their bodies appeared to be like those of sharks, blackish and
yellowish. They ran all around the sacrificial arena and thus began to create
disturbances.

--- Page 162 ---
164 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 5
while cursing Lord Siva, and Pisa, who, by smiling sympathetically, had
also shown his teeth.
PURPORT
Here a reference is made to the marriage of Aniruddha, a grandson of
Lord Krsna’s. He kidnapped the daughter of Dantavakra, and thereafter
he was arrested. Just as he was to be punished for the kidnapping, the
soldiers from Dvaraka, headed by Balarama, arrived, and a fight ensued
amongst the ksatriyas. This sort of fight was very common, especially
during marriage ceremonies, when everyone was in a challenging spirit.
In that challenging spirit, a fight was sure to occur, and in such fights
there was commonly killing and misfortune. After finishing such fighting
the parties would come to a compromise, and everything would be settled.
This Daksa yajiia was similar to such events. Now all of them—Daksa and
the demigods Bhaga and Pisa and Bhrgu Muni—were punished by the
soldiers of Lord Siva, but later everything would come to a peaceful end.
So this spirit of fighting between one another was not exactly inimical.
But, because everyone was so powerful and wanted to show his strength
by Vedic mantra or mystic power, all these fighting skills were very
elaborately exhibited by the different parties at the Daksa yajiia.

Then Virabhadra saw the wooden device in the sacrificial arena by which
the animals were to have been killed. He took the opportunity of this
facility to behead Daksa.


--- Page 164 ---
166 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 5
PURPORT
In this connection it is to be noted that the device used for killing
animals in the sacrifice was not designed to facilitate eating their flesh.
The killing was specifically intended to give a new life to the sacrificed
animal by the power of Vedic mantra. The animals were sacrificed to
test the strength of Vedic mantras; yajiias were performed as a test of the
mantra. Even in the modern age, tests are executed on animal bodies in the
physiology laboratory. Similarly, whether or not the brahmanas were
uttering the Vedic hymns correctly was tested by sacrifice in the arena.
On the whole, the animals thus sacrificed were not at all the losers. Some
old animals would be sacrificed, but in exchange for their old bodies they
received other, new bodies. That was the test of Vedic mantras. Virabhadra,
instead of sacrificing animals with the wooden device, immediately
beheaded Daksa, to the astonishment of everyone.

Upon seeing the action of Virabhadra, the party of Lord Siva was
pleased and cried out joyfully, and all the bhiitas, the ghosts and demons
that had come made a tumultuous sound. On the other hand, the
brahmanas who were in charge of the sacrifice cried out in grief at the
death of Daksa.

TRANSLATION

Virabhadra then took the head and, out of his great anger, threw it into
the southern side of the sacrificial fire, offering it as an oblation. In this
way all the followers of Lord Siva devastated all the arrangements for sacri-
fice. After setting fire to the whole arena, they departed for their master’s:
abode, Kailasa.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fourth Canto, Fifth
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled ‘Frustration of the Sacrifice
of Daksa.”

Both Lord Brahma and Visnu already knew that such events would

did not go to the sacrifice.
PURPORT
As stated in Bhagavad-gita, vedaham samalilani vartamandni carjuna
(Bg. 7.26). The Lord says, “1 know everything that has happened in the
past and is going to happen in the future.” Lord Vispu is omniscient, and
He therefore knew what would happen at Daksa’s sacrificial arena. For
this reason both Narayana and Lord Brahma did not attend the great
sacrifice performed by Daksa.

way; sa—that; bhiyat na—is not conducive; prayena—generally; bubhu-

TRANSLATION
When Lord Brahma heard everything from the demigods and the
members who had attended the sacrifice, he replied: You cannot be
happy in executing a sacrifice if you blaspheme a great personality and
thereby offend his lotus feet. You cannot have happiness in that way.
PURPORT
Lord Brahma explained to the demigods that although Daksa wanted to
enjoy the results of fruitive sacrificial activities, it is not possible to enjoy
when one offends a great personality like Lord Siva. It was good for Daksa
to have died in the fight because if he had lived he would have committed
such offenses at the lotus feet of great personalities again and again. Accord-
ing to Manu’s law, when a person commits murder, punishment is beneficial
for him because if he is not killed then he might commit more and more
murders and therefore be entangled in his future lives for having killed so
many persons. Therefore the king’s punishment of a murderer is appro-
priate. If those who are extremely offensive are killed by the grace of the
Lord, that is good for them. In other words, Lord Brahma explained to the
demigods that it was good for Daksa to have been killed.

TRANSLATION
You have excluded Lord Siva from taking part in the sacrificial results,
and therefore you are all offenders at his lotus feet. Still, if you go without
mental reservations and surrender unto him and fall down at his lotus
feet, he will be very pleased.
PURPORT
Lord Siva is also called Asutosa. Asu means very soon, and toga means
to become satisfied. The demigods were advised to go to Lord Siva and
beg his pardon, and because he is very easily pleased, it was certain that
their purpose would be served. Lord Brahma knew the mind of Lord Siva
very well, and he was confident that the demigods, who were offenders
at his lotus feet, could mitigate their offenses by going to him and surren-
dering without reservation.

immediately. Also, he said that Lord Siva was especially sorry because he
had recently lost his dear wife and was also very much afflicted by the
unkind words of Daksa. Under the circumstances, Lord Brahma suggested
that it would behoove them to go at once and beg his pardon.

TRANSLATION

Lord Brahma said that no one, including himself, Indra, all 1110 members
who were assembled in the sacrificial arena, and all the sages, could know
how powerful Lord Siva is. Under the circumstances, who would dare to
commit an offense at his lotus feet?

PURPORT

After Lord Brahma advised the demigods to go to Lord Siva and beg
his pardon, it was suggested how he should be satisfied and how the matter
should be placed before him. Brahma also asserted that none of the condi-
tioned souls, including himself and all the demigods, could know how to
satisfy Lord Siva. But he said, “It is known that he is very casily satisfied,
৪০ let us try to satisfy him by falling at his lotus feet.”

Actually the position of the subordinate always is to surrender to the
Supreme. That is the instruction of Bhagavad-gita. The Lord asks everyone
to give up all kinds of concocted occupations and simply surrender unto
Him. That will protect the conditioned souls from all sinful reactions.
Similarly, in this case Brahma also suggests that they go and surrender


--- Page 171 ---
174 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 6
unto the lotus feet of Lord Siva, for since he is very kind and easily
satisfied, this action would prove effective.

Text 23] Lord Brahma Satisfies Lord Siva 181
PURPORT
According to the commentary called Sri Bhagavata-candra-candrika, the
water in which Sati used to bathe was Ganges water. In other words, the
Ganges flowed through the Kailasa Parvata. There is every possibility of
accepting such a statement because Ganges water also flows from the hair
of Lord Siva. Since Ganges water rests on the head of Lord Siva and then
flows to the other parts of the universe, it is quite possible that the water
in which Sati bathed, which was certainly very nicely scented, was Ganges
water.

TRANSLATION
Thus the demigods saw the wonderfully beautiful region known as
Alaka in the forest known as Saugandhika, which means ‘full of fragrance.”
The forest is known as Saugandhika because of its abundance of lotus
flowers.
PURPORT
Sometimes Alaka is known as Alaka puri, which is also the name of the
abode of Kuvera. Kuvera’s abode, however, cannot be seen from Kailasa.
Therefore the region of Alaka referred to here is different from the Alaka
puri of Kuvera. According to Viraraghava Acarya, alak@ means ‘“‘uncom-
monly beautiful.” In the region of Alaka the demigods saw, there is a type
of lotus flower known as Saugandhika that distributes an especially fra-
grant scent.

It is understood that even the damsels of the heavenly planets are
polluted by thoughts of sex enjoyment, and therefore they come in


--- Page 180 ---
Text 25] Lord Brahma Satisfies Lord Siva 183
airplanes to bathe in the rivers Nanda and Alakananda. It is significant
that these rivers, Nanda and Alakanandai, are sanctified by the dust of the
lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In other words, just as
the Ganges is sacred because its water emanates from the toes of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana, so whenever water or any-
thing is in touch with devotional service of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, it is purified and spiritualized. The rules and regulations of
devotional service are based on this principle: anything in touch with the
lotus feet of the Lord is immediately freed from all material contamina-
tion. The damsels of the heavenly planets, polluted by thoughts of sex
life, come down to bathe in the sanctified rivers and enjoy sprinkling
water on their husbands.

Two words are very significant in this connection. Rati-karsita means
that the damsels become morose after sex enjoyment. Although they
accept sex enjoyment as a bodily demand, afterwards they are not happy.
Another significant point in this connection is that Lord Govinda, the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, is described here as tirtha-pada. Tirtha
means “sanctified place,” and pada means “lotus feet of the Lord.” People
go to a sanctified place to free themselves from all sinful reaction. In
other words, those who are devoted to the lotus feet of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Krsna, automatically become sanctified. The
Lord’s lotus feet are called tirtha-pada because under their protection
there are hundreds and thousands of saintly persons who sanctify the
sacred places of pilgrimage. Srila Narottamadasa Thakur, a great dearya of
the Gaudiya Vaisnava Sampradaya, advises us not to travel to different
places of pilgrimage. Undoubtedly, it is troublesome to go from one place to
another, but one who is intelligent can take shelter of the lotus feet of
Govinda and thereby be automatically, sanctified as the result of his
pilgrimage. Anyone who is fixed in the service of the lotus feet of Govinda
is called tirtha-pada; he does not need to travel on various pilgrimages, for
he can enjoy all the benefits of such travel simply by engaging in the
service of the lotus feet of the Lord. Such a pure devotee who has
implicit faith in the lotus feet of the Lord can create sacred places in any
part of. the world where he decides to remain. Tirthikurvanti tirthani
(Bhag. 1.13.10). The places are sanctified due to the presence of pure
devotees; any place automatically becomes a place of pilgrimage if either
the Lord or His pure devotee remains or resides there. In other words, such
a pure devotee, who is engaged one hundred percent in the service of the
Lord, can remain anywhere in the universe, and that part of the universe
immediately becomes a sacred place where he can peacefully render service
to the Lord as the Lord desires.

Text 28] Lord Brahma Satisfies Lord Siva 185
PURPORT
The airplanes described in this verse are different from the airplanes of
which we have experience. In the Srimad-Bhagavatam and all the Vedic
literatures, there are many descriptions of vimana, which means airplanes.
On different planets there are different kinds of airplanes. On this gross
planet earth, there are airplanes run by machine, but on other planets the
airplanes are not run by machine but by mantric hymns. They are also used
especially for enjoyment by the denizens of the heavenly planets so that
they can go from one planet to another. On other planets which are called
Siddhalokas the denizens can travel from one planet to another without
airplanes. The beautiful airplanes from the heavenly planets are compared
here to the sky because they fly in the sky; the passengers are compared
to the clouds. The beautiful damsels, the wives of the denizens of the
heavenly planets, are compared to lightning. In summation, the airplanes
with their passengers which came from higher planets to Kailasa were very
pleasant to look at.

gods. In the descriptions of him in Vedic literature, it is stated that he is

fabulously rich. It appears from these verses that Kailasa is situated near
the residential quarters of Kuvera. It is also stated here that the forest was
full of desire trees. In Brahma-samhita we learn about the desire tree which
is found in the spiritual world, especially in Krsnaloka, the abode of Lord
Krsna. We learn here that such desire trees are also found in Kailasa, the
residence of Lord Siva, by the grace of Krsna. It thus appears that Kailasa
has a special significance; it is almost like the residence of Lord Krsna.

In that celestial forest there were many birds whose necks were colored
reddish and whose sweet sounds mixed with the humming of the bees. The
lakes were abundantly decorated with crying swans as well as strong-
stemmed lotus flowers.
PURPORT
The beauty of the forest was intensified by the presence of various lakes.
It is described herein that the lakes were decorated with lotus flowers and
with swans who played and sang with the birds and the humming bees.
Considering all these attributes, one can imagine how beautiful this spot
was and how much the demigods passing through enjoyed the atmosphere.
There are many paths and beautiful spots created by man on this planet,
but none of them can surpass those of Kailasa, as they are described in
these verses.

TRANSLATION
All these atmospheric influences unsettled the forest elephants who
flocked together in the sandalwood forest, and the blowing wind agitated
the minds of the damsels there for further sex enjoyment.
PURPORT
Whenever there is a nice atmosphere in the material world, immediately
there is an awakening of the sexual appetite in the minds of materialistic
persons. This tendency is present everywhere within this material world,
not only on this earth but in higher planetary systems as well. In complete
contrast to the influence of this atmosphere on the minds of the living
entities within the material world is the description of the spiritual world.
The women there are hundreds and thousands of times more beautiful
than the women here in this material world, and the spiritual atmosphere
is also many times better. Yet despite the pleasant atmosphere, the minds
of the denizens do not become agitated because in the spiritual world, the
Vaikuntha planets, the spiritualistic minds of the inhabitants are so much
absorbed in the spiritual vibration of chanting the glories of the Lord
that such enjoyment could not be surpassed by any other enjoyment, even
sex, which is the culmination of all pleasure in the material world. In other
words, in the Vaikuntha world, in spite of its better atmosphere and
facilities, there is no impetus for sex life. As stated in Bhagavad-gita
(Bg. 2.59), param drstva nivartate: the inhabitants are so spiritually
enlightened that in the presence of such spirituality sex life is insignificant.

shaken; cha@yah—the shadow; nirnidah—without bird nests; tapa-varjitah—
without temperature.
TRANSLATION
That banyan tree was 800 miles high, and its branches spread over 600
miles around. The tree cast a fine shade which permanently cooled the
temperature, yet there was no noise of birds.
PURPORT
Generally, in every 1166 there are bird nests, and the birds congregate
in the evening and create noise. But it appears that this banyan tree was
devoid of nests, and therefore it was calm, quiet and peaceful, and its
temperature was undisturbed, so it was just suitable for meditation.

tasmin—under that tree; mahayogamaye—having many sages engaged
in meditation on the Supreme; mumuksu—of those who desire liberation;
Sarane—the shelter; surah—the demigods; dadrsuh—saw; sivam— Lord Siva;
asinam—seated; tyakta-amarsam—having given up anger; iva—as; antakam—
eternal time.

TRANSLATION

The demigods saw Lord Siva sitting under that tree, which was com-
petent to give perfection to mystic yogis and deliver all people. As grave
as time eternal, he appeared to have given up all anger.

PURPORT

In this verse the word maha-yoga-maye is very significant. Yoga means
meditation on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and maha-yoga means
those who engage in the devotional service of Vignu. Meditation means
remembering, smarapnam. There are nine different kinds of devotional ser-
vice, of which smarapam is one process; the yogi remembers the form of
Vignu within his heart. Thus there were many devotees engaged in medita-
tion on Lord Visnu under the big banyan tree.

The Sanskrit word maha is derived from the affix mahat. This affix is
used when there is a great number or quantity, so mahd-yoga indicates
that there were many great yogis and devotees meditating on the form of
Lord Visnu. Generally such meditators are desirous of liberation from
material bondage, and they are promoted to the spiritual world to one of
the Vaikunthas. Liberation means freedom from material bondage or
nescience. In the material world we are suffering life after life because of
our bodily identification, and liberation is freedom from that miserable
condition of life.

sanandana-adyaih—the four Kumaras headed by Sanandana; maha-sid-
dhaih—liberated souls; santaih—saintly; sarsanta-vigraham—the grave and
saintly Lord Siva; upasyamanam—was being praised; sakhya—by Kuvera;
ca—and; bhartra—by the master; guhyaka-raksasam—of the Guhyakas and
the Raksasas.

TRANSLATION

Lord Siva sat there, surrounded by saintly persons like Kuvera, the
master of the Guhyakas, and the four Kumaras, who were already
liberated souls. Lord Siva was grave and saintly.

PURPORT

The personalities who were sitting with Lord Siva are significant because
the four Kumiras were liberated from birth. It may be remembered that
after their birth these Kumaras were requested by their father to get
married and beget children in order to increase the population of the
newly created universe. But they refused, and at that time, Lord Brahma
was angry. In that angry mood, Rudra, or Lord Siva, was born. Thus they
were intimately related. Kuvera, the treasurer of the demigods, is fabulous-
ly rich. Thus Lord Siva’s association with the Kumaras and Kuvera indi-
cates that he has all transcendental and material opulences. Actually, he is
the qualitative incarnation of the Supreme Lord; therefore his position is
very exalted.

TRANSLATION

The demigods saw Lord Siva situated in his perfection as the master of

the senses, knowledge, fruitive activities and the path of achieving perfec-

Text 36] Lord Brahma Satisfies Lord Siva 191
tion. He was the friend of the entire world, and due to his full affection
for everyone, he was very auspicious.

PURPORT

Lord Siva is full of wisdom and tapasya, austerity. One who knows the
modes of work is understood to be situated on the path of devotional
service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One cannot serve the
Supreme Personality of Godhead unless he has achieved full perfectional
knowledge in the ways and means of performing devotional service.

Lord Siva is described here as adhisvara. I$vara means “controller,” and
adht$vara means particularly “controller of the senses.” Generally our
materially contaminated senses are apt to engage in sense gratificatory
activities, but when a person is elevated by wisdom and austerity, the
senses then become purified, and they become engaged in the service of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord Siva is the emblem of such
perfection, and therefore in the scriptures, it is said, vaispavanam yatha
sambhuh: Lord Siva is a Vaignava. Lord Siva, by his action within this
material world, teaches all conditioned souls how to engage in devotional
service twenty-four hours a day. Therefore he is described here as
loka-mangala, good fortune personified for all conditioned souls.

TRANSLATION

He was seated on a deer skin and was practicing all forms of austerity.
Because his body was smeared with ashes, he looked like an evening cloud.
On his hair was the sign of a half moon, a symbolic representation.

192 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 6
PURPORT
Lord Siva’s symptoms of austerity are not exactly those of a Vaignava.
Lord Siva is certainly the number one Vaisnava, but he exhibited a feature
for a particular class of men who cannot follow the Vaisnava principles.
The Saivites, the devotees of Lord Siva, generally dress like Lord Siva, and
sometimes they indulge in smoking and taking intoxicants. Such practices
are never accepted by the followers of Vaisnava rituals.

TRANSLATION
He was seated on a straw mattress and was speaking to all who were
present there, including the great sage Narada. He was specifically talking
to him about the Absolute Truth.
PURPORT
The lord was sitting on a mattress of straw because such a sitting place
is accepted by persons who are practicing austerities to gain understanding
of the Absolute Truth. In this verse it is specifically mentioned that he was
speaking to the great sage Narada, a celebrated devotee. Narada was asking
Lord Siva about devotional service, and Siva, being the topmost Vaisnava,
was instructing him. In other words, Lord Siva and Narada were discussing
the knowledge of the Veda, but it is to be understood that the subject
matter was devotional service. Another point in this connection is that
Lord Siva is the supreme instructor and the great sage Narada is the
supreme audience. Therefore, the supreme subject matter of Vedic knowl-
edge is bhakti, or devotional service.

TRANSLATION
His left leg was placed on his right thigh, and his left hand was placed
on his left thigh. In his right hand he held rudraksa beads. This sitting
posture is called virasana. He sat in the virasana posture, and his finger
was in the mode of argument.
PURPORT
The sitting posture described herein is called virdsana according to the
system of astanga-yoga performances. In the performance of yoga there
are eight divisions, such as yama and niyama— controlling, following the
rules and regulations, then practicing the sitting postures, etc. Besides
virasana there are other sitting postures, such as padmdsana and
siddhasana. Practice of these asanas without elevating oneself to the
position of realizing the Supersoul, Vignu, is not the perfectional stage of
yoga. Lord Siva is called yogisvara, the master of all yogis, and Krsna is also
called yogesvara. YogiSvara indicates that no one can surpass the yoga
practice of Lord Siva, and yogesvara indicates that no one can surpass the
yogic perfection of Krsna. Another significant word is tarka-mudra. This
indicates that the fingers are opened and the second finger is raised, along
with the arm, to impress the audience with some subject matter. This is
actually a symbolic representation.

saloka-palah— along with the demigods (headed by Indra); munayah—the
sages; manunam—of all thinkers; adyam—the chief; manum—thinker;

TRANSLATION

All the sages and the demigods, headed by Indra, offered their respect-
ful obeisances unto Lord Siva with folded hands. Lord Siva was dressed
in saffron colored garments and was absorbed in trance, thus appearing to
be the head of all sages.

PURPORT

In this verse the word brahmananda is significant. This brahmananda,
or brahma-nirvana, is explained by Prahlada Maharaja. When one 15 com-
pletely absorbed in the adhoksaja, the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
who is beyond the sense perception of materialistic persons, this is called
brahmananda.

It is impossible to conceive of the existence, name, form, quality and
pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead because He is transcen-
dentally situated beyond the conception of materialistic persons. Because
materialists cannot imagine or conceive of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, they may think that God is dead, but factually He is always
existing in His sac-cid-ananda-vigraha, His eternal form. Constant medita-
tion concentrated on the form of the Lord is called samadhi, ecstasy or
trance. Samadhi means particularly concentrated attention, so one who has
achieved the qualification of always meditating on the Personality of
Godhead is to be understood to be always in trance and enjoying brahma-
nirvana or brahmananda. Lord Siva exhibited those symptoms, and there-
fore it is stated that he was absorbed in brahmananda.

Another significant word is yogakaksam. Yogakaksam is the sitting
posture in which the left thigh is fixed under one’s tightly knotted saffron

Text 40] Lord Brahma Satisfies Lord Siva 195
colored garment. Also the words maniinam adyam are significant here be-
cause they mean a philosopher or one who is thoughtful and can think very
nicely. Such a man is called manu. Lord Siva is described in this verse as the
chief of all thinkers. Lord Siva, of course, does not engage in useless mental
speculation, but as stated in the previous verse, he is always thoughtful
regarding how to deliver the demons from their fallen condition of life.
It is said that during the advent of Lord Caitanya, Sada-Siva appeared as
Advaita Prabhu, and Advaita Prabhu’s chief concern was to elevate the
fallen conditioned souls to the platform of devotional service to Lord
Krsna. Since people were engaged in useless occupations which would
continue their material existence, Lord Siva, in the form of Lord Advaita,
appealed to the Supreme Lord to appear as Lord Caitanya to deliver these
illusioned souls. Actually Lord Caitanya appeared on the request of Lord
Advaita. Similarly, Lord Siva has a sampraddya, the Rudra Sampradaya.
He is always thinking about the deliverance of the fallen souls, as exhibited
by Lord Advaita Prabhu.

Lord Siva's lotus feet were worshiped by both the demigods and

Lord Brahma was there among all the other demigods, immediately he
stood up and offered his respect to him by bowing down and touching his

196 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 6
lotus feet. This action was just like that of Vamanadeva, who offered His
respectful obeisances to Kasyapa Muni.
PURPORT
Kasyapa Muni was in the category of the living entities, but he had a tran-
scendental son, Vamanadeva, who was an incarnation of Visnu. Thus
although Lord Visnu is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He offered
His respects to Kasyapa Muni. Similarly, when Lord Krsna was a child He
used to offer His respectful obeisances to His mother and father, Nanda
and Ya$oda. Also at the Battle of Kuruksetra, Lord Krsna touched the
feet of Maharaja Yudhisthira because he was His elder. It appears, then,
that the Personality of Godhead, Lord Siva and other devotees, in spite of
their being situated in exalted positions, instructed by practical example
how to offer obeisances to their superiors. Lord Siva offered his respectful
obeisances to Brahma because Brahma was his father, just as Kasyapa Muni
was the father of Vamana.

PURPORT
Lord Brahma was smiling because he knew that Lord Siva is not only
easily satisfied but easily irritated as well. He was afraid that Lord Siva
might be in an angry mood because he had lost his wife and had been
insulted by Daksa. In order to conceal this fear, he smiled and addressed
Lord Siva as follows.

Lord Brahma said: My dear Lord Siva, I know that you are the con-

the cosmic manifestation as well. I know you in that way.
PURPORT
Although Lord Brahma had received very respectful obeisances from
Lord Siva, still he knew that Lord Siva was in a more exalted position than
himself. Lord Siva’s position is described in Brahma-sarithita; there is no
difference between Lord Vignu and Lord Siva in their original positions,
but still Lord Siva is different from Lord Visnu. The example is given that
the milk in yogurt is not different from the original milk from which it
was made.

TRANSLATION
My dear lord, you create this cosmic manifestation, maintain it and anni-
hilate it by expansion of your personality, exactly as a spider creates,

PURPORT
In this verse the word siva-sakti is significant. Siva means auspicious, and
Sakti means energy. There are many types of energies of the Supreme
Lord, and all of them are auspicious. Brahma, Visnu and Mahesvara are
called gupdvataras or incarnations of material qualities. In the material
world we compare these different incarnations from different angles of
vision, but since all of them are expansions of the supreme auspicious, all
of them are auspicious, although sometimes we consider one quality of
nature to be higher or lower than another. The mode of ignorance or
tamoguna is considered very much lower than the others, but in the
higher sense it is also auspicious. The example may be given herein that
the government has both an educational department and criminal depart-
ment. An outsider may consider the criminal department inauspicious,
but from the government’s point of view it is as important as the education
department, and therefore the government finances both departments
equally, without discrimination.

TRANSLATION
My dear lord, your lordship has introduced the system of sacrifices
through the agency of Daksa and thus one may derive the benefits of reli-
gious activities and economic development. Under your regulative principles,
the institution of the four varnas and asramas is respected. The brahmanas
therefore vow to follow this system strictly.
PURPORT
The Vedic system of varna and asrama is never to be neglected because
these divisions are created by the Supreme Lord Himself for the upkeep of
social and religious order in human society. The brahmanas, as the intelli-
gent class of men in society, must be avowed to steadily respect this
regulative principle. The tendency in this age of Kali to make a classless
society and not observe the principles of varpa and dsrama is a manifesta-
tion of an impossible dream. Destruction of the social and spiritual orders
will not bring fulfillment of the idea of a classless society. ®ne should
observe the principles of varna and asrama strictly for the satisfaction of
the creator, for 1115 stated in the Bhagavad-gitd by Lord Krsna that the four
orders of the social system—brdhmanas, ksatriyas, vaiSyas and $iidras—are
His creation. They should act according to the regulative principles of this
institution and satisfy the Lord, just as different parts of the body all
engage in the service of the whole. The whole is the Supreme Personality
of Godhead in His virdta-riipa or universal form. The brahmanas, ksatriyas,
vaiSyas and $iidras are respectively the mouth, arms, abdomen and legs of


--- Page 197 ---
200 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 6
the universal form of the Lord. So long as they are engaged in the service
of the complete whole, their position is secure, otherwise they fall down
from their respective positions and become degraded.

TRANSLATION
O most auspicious lord, you have destined the heavenly planets, the
spiritual Vaikuntha planets, or the impersonal Brahman sphere as the
respective positions of the performers of auspicious activities. Similarly,
for others, who are miscreants, you have destined different kinds of hells
which are horrible and ghastly. Yet sometimes it is found that their desti-
nations are just the opposite. It is very difficult to ascertain the cause of this.
PURPORT
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is called the supreme will. By the
supreme will everything is happening. It is said, therefore, that not a blade
of grass moves without the supreme will. Generally it is prescribed that
performers of pious activities are promoted to the higher planetary systems,
devotees are promoted to the Vaikunthas or spiritual worlds, and imperson-
al speculators are promoted to the impersonal Brahman effulgence; but it
sometimes so happens that a miscreant like Ajamila is immediately pro-
moted to the Vaikuntha-loka simply by chanting the name of Narayana.


--- Page 198 ---
Text 46] Lord Brahma Satisfies Lord Siva 201
Although when Ajamila uttered this vibration he intended to call his son
Narayana, Lord Narayana took it seriously and immediately gave him
promotion to Vaikuntha-loka, despite his background, which was full of
sinful activities. Similarly King Daksa was always engaged in the pious
activities of performing sacrifices, yet simply because of creating a little
misunderstanding with Lord Siva, he was severely taken to task. The con-
clusion is, therefore, that the supreme will is the ultimate judgment; no
one can argue upon this. A pure devotee therefore submits in all circum-
stances to the supreme will of the Lord, accepting it as all-auspicious.

(Bhag. 10.14.8)
The purport of this verse is that when a devotee is in a calamitous con-
dition he takes it as a benediction of the Supreme Lord and takes respon-
sibility for himself for his past misdeeds. In such a condition, he offers still
more devotional services and is not disturbed. One who lives in such a
disposition of mind, engaged in devotional service, is the most eligible
candidate for promotion to the spiritual world. In other words, such a
devotee’s claim for promotion to the spiritual world is assured in all
circumstances.

TRANSLATION
My dear lord, devotees who have fully dedicated their lives unto your
lotus feet certainly observe your presence as Paramatma in each and every
being, and as such they do not differentiate between one living being and
another. Such persons treat all living entities equally. They never become
overwhelmed by anger like animals, who can see nothing without differ-
entiation.
PURPORT
When the Supreme Personality of Godhead becomes angry or kills a
demon, materially it may appear unfavorable, but spiritually this is a
blissful blessing upon him. Therefore pure devotees do not make any
distinction between the Lord’s anger and His blessings. They see both
with reference to the Lord’s behavior with others and themselves. A
devotee does not find fault with the behavior of the Lord in any circum-
stances.

Text 47] Lord Brahma Satisfies Lord Siva 203
TRANSLATION

Persons who observe everything with differentiation, who are simply
attached to fruitive activities, who are mean-minded, who are always
pained to see the flourishing condition of others and who thus give
distress to them by uttering harsh and piercing words have already been
killed by Providence. Thus there is no need for them to be killed again by
an exalted personality like you.

PURPORT

Persons who are materialistic and always engaged in fruitive activities
for material profit cannot endure seeing the flourishing life of others.
But for a few persons in Krsna consciousness, the entire world is full of
such envious persons, who are perpetually full of anxieties because they
are attached to the material body and are without self-realization. Since
their hearts are always filled with anxiety, it is understood that they have
already been killed by Providence. Thus Lord Siva, as a self-realized
Vaisnava, was advised not to kill Daksa. A Vaignava is described as para-
duhkha-duhkhi because although he is never distressed in any condition
of life, he is distressed to see others in a distressed condition. ४ 818114५8,
therefore, should not try to kill by any action of the body or mind but
should try to revive the Krsna consciousness of others out of compassion
for them. The Krsna consciousness movement has been started to deliver
the envious persons of the world from the clutches of mdyd, and even
though they are sometimes put in trouble, devotees push on the Krsna
consciousness movement in all tolerance. Lord Caitanya advises:

trnad api sunicena taror api sahispuna

amdnina manadena kirtaniyah sada harih
“One can chant the holy name of the Lord in a humble state of mind,
thinking himself lower than the straw in the street. One should be more
tolerant than the tree, devoid of all sense of false prestige and ready to of-
fer all respects to others. In such a state of mind one can chant the holy
name of the Lord constantly.” (Siksdstakam, 3)

A Vaignava should follow the examples of such Vaisnavas as Haridasa
Thakura, Nityananda Prabhu and also Lord Jesus Christ. There is no need
to kill anyone who has already been killed. But it should be noted here-
with that a Vaispava should not tolerate the blaspheming of Visnu or
Vaignavas, although he should tolerate personal insults to himself.

TRANSLATION
My dear lord, if in some places materialists who are already bewildered
by the insurmountable illusory energy of the Supreme Godhead sometimes
commit offenses, a saintly person, with compassion, does not take this
seriously. Knowing that they committed the offenses because they were
overpowered by the illusory energy, he does not show his prowess to
counteract them.
PURPORT
It is said that the beauty of a tapasvi or saintly person is forgiveness.
There arc many instances in the spiritual history of the world in which
many saintly persons, although unnecessarily harassed, did not take
action, although they could have done so. Pariksit Maharaja, for example,
was unnecessarily cursed by a brdhmanpa boy, and this was very much
regretted by the boy's father, but Pariksit Maharaja accepted the curse and
agreed to die within a week as the brahmana boy desired. Parikgit Maharaja
was the Emperor and was full in power both spiritually and materially,
but out of compassion and out of respect for the brahmapa community,
he did not counteract the action of the brdhmana boy but agreed to die
within seven days. Because it was desired by Krsna that Pariksit Maharaja
agree to the punishment so that the instruction of Srimad-Bhagavatam


--- Page 202 ---
Text 49] Lord Brahma Satisties Lord Siva 205
would thus be revealed to the world, Pariksit Maharaja was advised not to
take action. A Vaignpava is personally tolerant for the benefit of others.
When he does not show his prowess, this does not mean that he is lacking
in strength, but it indicates thal he is tolerant for the welfare of the entire
human society.

TRANSLATION

My dear lord, you are never bewildered by the formidable influence of
the illusory energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore you
are omniscient and should be merciful and compassionate upon those who
are bewildered by the same illusory energy and are very much attached to
fruitive activities.

PURPORT

A Vaignava is never bewildered by the influence of the external energy
because he is engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord.
The Lord states in Bhagavad-gita:

daivi hy esa gunamayi mama maya duratyaya
mam eva ye prapadyante mayam elam taranti te

“My divine energy consisting of the three modes of material nature is
difficult to overcome. But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily


--- Page 203 ---
206 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 6
cross beyond it.” (Bg. 7.14) A Vaisnava should take care of those who
are bewildered by this maya instead of becoming angry with them because
without a Vaignava’s mercy they have no way to get out of the clutches
of maya. Those who have been condemned by maya are rescued by the
mercy of devotees.
vanca-kalpatarubhyas ca krpa-sindhubhya eva ca

“I offer my respectful obeisances unto all the Vaisnava devotees of the
Lord. They are just like desire trees who can fulfill the desires of everyone,
and they are full of compassion for the fallen conditioned souls.” Those
who are under the influence of the illusory energy are attracted to
fruitive activities, but a Vaignava preacher attracts their hearts to the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, जप Krsna.

O destroyer of the sacrifice, please take your portion of the sacrifice

PURPORT

A sacrifice is a ceremony इ to please the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead. In the Srimad-Bhagavatam, First Canto, Second
Chapter, it is stated that everyone should try to understand whether the
Supreme Personality of Godhead is satisfied by his activity. In other words,
the aim of our activities should be to satisfy the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Just as in an office it is the duty of the worker to see that the
proprietor or the master is satisfied, so everyone's duty is to see whether
the Supreme Personality of Godhead is satisfied by one’s activity. Activities
to satisfy the Supreme Godhead are prescribed in the Vedic literature, and
execution of such activities is called yajiia. In other words, acting on
behalf of the Supreme l.ord is called yajiia. One should know very well that
any other activity besides yajfia is the cause of material bondage. That is
explained in Bhagavad-gita, Third Chapter, ninth verse: yajiidrthdt
karmano’nyatra loko ‘yam karma-bandhanah. Karma-bandhanah means
that if we do not work for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord, Visnu,
then the reaction of our work will bind us. One should not work for his
own sense gratification. Everyone should work for the satisfaction of God.
That is called yajiia.

After the yajiia was performed by Daksa, all the demigods expected
prasadam, the remnants of foodstuffs offered to Vispu. Lord Siva is one of


--- Page 206 ---
Text 53] Lord Brahma Satisfies Lord Siva 209
the demigods, so naturally he also expected his share of the prasadam
from the yajiia. But Daksa, out of his envy for Lord Siva, did not invite
Siva to participate in the yajiia, nor did he give him his share after the
offering. But after the destruction of the yajiia arena by the followers of
Lord Siva, Lord Brahma pacified him and assured him that he would get
his share of prasadam. Thus he was requested to rectify whatever destruc-
tion was caused by the followers.

In Bhagavad-gita, Third Chapter, eleventh verse, it is said that all the
demigods are satisfied when one performs yajiia. Because the demigods
expect prasadam from yajiias, yajiia must be performed. Those who
engage in sense gratificatory materialistic activities must perform yajiia,
otherwise they will be implicated. Thus Daksa, being the father of man-
kind, was performing अ and Lord Siva expected his share. But since he
was not invited, there was trouble. By the mediation of Lord Brahma,
however, everything was settled satisfactorily.

The performance of yajiia is a very difficult task because all the demigods
must be invited to participate in the yajiia. In this Kali-yuga it is not
possible to perform such costly sacrifices, nor is it possible to invite the
demigods to participate. Therefore in this age, it is recommended, yajiiaii
sankirtana-prayair yajanti hi sumedhasah (Bhag. 11.5.32). Those who are
intelligent should know that in the Kali-yuga there is no possibility of
performing the Vedic sacrifices. But unless one pleases the demigods,
there will be no regulated seasonal activities or rainfall. Everything is
controlled by the demigods. Under the circumstances, in this age, in order
to keep the balance of social peace and prosperity, all intelligent men
should execute the performance of sankirtana-yajiia by chanting the holy
names Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare
Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. One should invite people, chant Hare
Krsna, and then distribute prasadam. This yajiia will satisfy all the demi-
gods, and thus there will be peace and prosperity in the world. Another
difficulty in performing the Vedic rituals is that if one fails to satisfy even
one demigod out of the many hundreds of thousands of demigods, just as
Daksa failed to satisfy Lord Siva, there will be disaster. But in this age the
performance of sacrifice has been simplified. One can chant Hare Krsna,
and by pleasing Krsna one can satisfy all the demigods automatically.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fourth Canto, Sixth
ba of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “Lord Brahma Satisfies Lord

iva.”

created by the demigods. Because they are childish and less intelligent, 1

only in order to right them.
PURPORT
There are two types of punishment. One is that which a conqueror
imposes on an enemy, and the other is like that a father imposes on
his son. There is a gulf of difference between these two kinds of pun-
ishment. Lord Siva is by nature a Vaignava, a great devotee, and his
name in this connection is Adutosa. Ile is always satisfied, and therefore
he did not become angry as if he were an enemy. Ile is not inimical to any
living entity, but he always wishes the welfare of all. Whenever he chastises
a person, it is just like a father’s punishment of his son. Lord Siva is like a
father because he never takes seriously any offense by any living entities,
especially the demigods.

Otherwise he was allowed to swallow only dough made of chick pea flour.

purposes because he had laughed at Lord Siva, deriding him by showing

because he had used them against Lord Siva.

TRANSLATION
Those who have had their arms cut off will have to work with the arms
of Aévinikumara, and those whose hands were cut off will have to do their
work with the hands of Pisa. The priests will also have to act in that
manner. As for Bhrgu, he will have the beard from the goat’s head.
PURPORT
Bhrgu Muni, a great supporter of Daksa, was awarded the beard of the
goat’s head which was substituted for the head of Daksa. It appears from
the exchange of Daksa’s head that the modern scientific theory that the
brain substance is the cause of all intelligent work is not valid. The brain
substance of Daksa and that of a goat are different, but Daksa still acted
like himself, even though his head was replaced by that of a goat. The
conclusion is that it is the particular consciousness of an individual
soul which acts. The brain substance is only an instrument which has
nothing to do with real intelligence. The real intelligence, mind and con-
sciousness are part of the particular individual soul. It will be found in the
verses ahead that after Daksa’s head was replaced by the goat’s head, he


--- Page 211 ---
Text 6] The Sacrifice Performed by Daksa 215
was as intelligent as he had previously been. He prayed very nicely to
satisfy Lord Siva and Lord Visnu, which is not possible for a goat to do.
Therefore it is definitely concluded that the brain substance is not the
center of intelligence; it is the consciousness of a particular soul that works
intelligently. The whole movement of Krsna consciousness is to purify the
consciousness. It doesn’t matter what kind of brain one has because if he
simply transfers his consciousness from matter to Krsna, his life becomes
successful. It is confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gita that
anyone who takes up Krsna consciousness achieves the highest perfection
of life, regardless of whatever abominable condition of life he may have
fallen into. Specifically, anyone in Krsna consciousness goes back to God-
head, back to home, on leaving his present material body.

TRANSLATION
The great sage Maitreya said: My dear Vidura, all the personalities
present were very much satisfied in heart and soul upon hearing the words
of Lord Siva, who is the best among the benedictors.
PURPORT
In this verse Lord Siva is described as midhustama, the best of the
benedictors. He is also known asAsutosa, which indicates that he is very
quickly satisfied and very quickly angered. It is said in Bhagavad-gita that
less intelligent persons go to the demigods for material benediction. In this
connection, people gencrally go to Lord Siva, and because he is always


--- Page 212 ---
216 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 7
quickly satisfied and gives benediction (0 his devotees without consider-
ation, he is called midhugtama, or the best of the benedictors. Materialistic
persons are always anxious to gel material profit, but they are not serious
about spiritual profit.

Sometimes, of course, it so happens that Lord Siva becomes the best
benedictor in spiritual life. It is said that once a poor brahmapa worshiped
Lord Siva for a benediction, and Lord Siva advised the devotee to go to see
Sanatana Gosvami. The devotee went to Sanatana Gosvami and informed
him that Lord Siva had advised him to seek out the best benediction from
him (Sanatana). Sanatana had a touchstone with him, which he kept with
the garbage. On the request of the poor brahmana, Sanatana Gosvami gave
him the touchstone, and the brahmana was very happy to have it. He now
could get as much gold as he desired simply by touching the touchstone to
iron. But after he left Sanatana, he thought, “If a touchstone is the best
benediction, why has Sanatana Gosvami kept it with the garbage?” He
therefore returned and asked Sanatana Gosvami, “Sir, if this is the best
benediction, why did you keep it with the garbage?” Sanatana Gosvami
then informed him, “Actually, this is not the best benediction. But are you
prepared to take the best benediction from me?” The brahmana said, “Yes,
sir. Lord Siva has sent me to you for the best benediction.” Then Sanatana
Gosvami asked him to throw the touchstone in the water nearby and then
come back. The poor brahmapa did so, and when he returned, Sanatana
Gosvami initiated him with the Hare Krsna mantra. Thus by the benedic-
tion of Lord Siva the brahmana got the association of the best devotee of
Lord Krsna and was thus initiated in the mahamantra, Hare Krsna, Hare
Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama,
Hare Hare.

Thereafter, Bhrgu, the head of the great sages, invited Lord Siva 10
come to the sacrificial arena, and thus the demigods, accompanied by
the sages, Lord Siva and Lord Brahma, all went to the place where the
greal sacrifice was being performed.
PURPORT
The whole sacrifice arranged by King Daksa had been disturbed by
Lord Siva. Therefore all the demigods present there, along with Lord
Brahma and the great sages, specifically requested Lord Siva to come and
revive the sacrificial fire. There is a common phrase, $iva-hina-yajiia: “Any
sacrifice without the presence of Lord Siva is baffled.” Although Lord
Visnu is Yajiieévara, the Supreme Personality in the matter of sacrifice,
still in each yajiia it is necessary for all the demigods, headed by lord
Brahma and Lord Siva, to be present.

PURPORT
This time, all the demigods and great sages were very careful not to
irritate Lord Siva. Therefore whatever he asked was done. It is specifically
said here that Daksa’s body was joined to the head of an animal (a goat).

sandhiyamane—being executed; sirasi—by the head; daksah—King Daksa;

immediately; supte—sleeping; iva—like; uttasthau—awakened; dadrse—saw;

TRANSLATION
When the animal’s head was fixed on the body of King Daksa, Daksa
was immediately brought to consciousness, and as he awakened from sleep,
the King saw Lord Siva standing before him.
PURPORT
The example given here is that Daksa got up as if he were awakened
from deep sleep. In Sanskrit this is called supta ivottasthau. The meaning
is that after a man awakens from sleep, he immediately remembers all the
duties which he must execute. Daksa was killed, and his head was taken
away and burnt to ashes. His body was lying dead, but by the grace of
Lord Siva, as soon as the head of a goat was joined to the body, Daksa
came back to consciousness again. This indicates that consciousness is
also individual. Daksa actually took another body when he took on the
head of a goat, but because consciousness is individual, his consciousness
remained the same although his bodily condition changed. Thus bodily
construction has nothing to do with the development of consciousness.
Consciousness is carried with the transmigration of the soul. There are
many instances of this in Vedic history, such as the case of Maharaja
Bharata. After quitting his body as a king, Maharaja Bharata was trans-
ferred to the body of a deer, but he retained the same consciousness. He


--- Page 215 ---
Text 10] T he Sacrifice Performed by Daksa 219
knew that although formerly he was King Bharata, he had been transferred
to the body of a deer because of his absorption in thinking of a deer at the
time of his death. In spite of his having the body of a deer, however, his
consciousness was as good as il was in the body of King Bharata. The
arrangement by the Lord is so nice that if a person’s consciousness is
turned into Krsna consciousness, there is no doubt that in his next life he
will be a great devotee of Krsna, even if he is offered a different type of
body.

TRANSLATION

At that time, when Daksa saw Lord Siva, who rides upon a bull, his
heart, which was polluted by envy of Lord Siva, was immediately cleansed,
just as the water in a lake is cleansed by autumn rains.

PURPORT

Here is an example of why Lord Siva is called auspicious. If anyone sees
Lord Siva with devotion and reverence, his heart is immediately cleansed.
King Daksa was polluted by envy of Lord Siva, and yet by seeing him with
a little love and devotion, his heart immediately became cleansed. In the
rainy season, the reservoirs of water become dirty and muddy, but as soon
as the autumn rain comes, all the water immediately becomes clear and
transparent. Similarly, although Daksa’s heart was impure because of his
slandering Lord Siva, for which he was severely punished, Daksa now came
to consciousness, and just by seeing Lord Siva with veneration and respect,
he became immediately purified.

TRANSLATION
King Daksa said: My dear Lord Siva, ] committed a great offense
against you, but you are so kind that instead of withdrawing your mercy,
you have done me a great favor by punishing me. Both yourself and
Lord Visnu do not neglect even useless unqualified brahmanas. Why, then,
should you neglect me, who am engaged in performing sacrifices?
PURPORT
Although Daksa felt that he was defeated, he knew that his punishment
was simply the great mercy of Lord Siva. He remembered that Lord Siva
and Lord Vignu are never neglectful of the brahmanas, even though they
are sometimes unqualified. According to Vedic civilization, a person who
is a descendant of a brahmana family should never be heavily punished.
This was exemplified in Arjuna’s treatment of Aévatthama. Asvatthama
was the son of a great brahmana, Dronacarya, and in spite of his commit-
ting the great offense of killing all the sleeping sons of the Pandavas, for


--- Page 218 ---
222 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 7
which he was condemned even by Lord Krsna, Arjuna excused him by not
killing him because he happened to be the son of a brahmana. The word
brahma-bandhusu used here is significant. Brahma-bandhu means a person
who is born of a brahmana father but whose activities are not up to the
standard of the brahmapas. Such a person is not a brahmapa, but is a
brahma-bandhu. Daksa proved himself to be a brahma-bandhu. He was
born of a great brahmapa father, Lord Brahma, but his treatment of Lord
Siva was not exactly brahminical; therefore he admitted that he was not a
perfect brahmana. Lord Siva and Lord Visnu, however, are affectionate
even to an imperfect brahmana. Lord Siva punished Daksa not as one does
his enemy, but he punished him just to bring him to his senses, so that he
would know that he had done wrong. Daksa could understand this, and he
acknowledged the great mercy of Lord Krsna and Lord Siva towards the
fallen brahmapas, including even himself. Although he was fallen, his vow
was to execute the sacrifice, as is the duty of brahmanas, and thus he
began his prayers to Lord Siva.

TRANSLATION

My dear great and powerful Lord Siva, you were created first from the
mouth of Lord Brahma in order to protect the brahmanas in pursuing
education, austerities, vows and self-realization. As protector of the


--- Page 219 ---
Text 14] The Sacrifice Performed by Daksa 223
brahmanas, you always protect the regulative principles followed by them,
just as a cowherd boy keeps a stick in his hand to give protection to the
cows.

PURPORT

The specific function of a human being in society, irrespective of his
social status, is to practice control of the mind and senses by observing the
regulative principles enjoined in the Vedic sastras. Lord Siva is called
pasupati because he protects the living entities in their developed conscious
ness so that they may follow the Vedic system of varna and @srama. The
word pasu refers to the animal as well as to the human entity. It is stated
here that Lord Siva is always interested in protecting the animals and the
animal-like living entities who are not very advanced in the spiritual sense.
It is also stated that the brahmanas are produced from the mouth of the
Supreme Lord. We should always remember that Lord Siva is being
addressed as the representative of the Supreme Lord Visnu. In the Vedic
literature it is described that the brahmanas are born from the mouth of
the universal form of Visnu, the ksatriyas are born from His arms, the
vai§yas are born from His abdomen or waist, and the $iidras are born from
His legs. In the formation of a body, the head is the principal factor. The
brahmanas are born from the mouth of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead in order to accept charity for worship of Visnu and to spread
Vedic knowledge. Lord Siva is known as pasupati, the protector of the
bnihmanas and other living entities. He protects them from the attacks of
non-brahmanas, or uncultured persons who are against the self-realization
process.

Another feature of this word is that persons who are simply attached to
the ritualistic portion of the Vedas and do not understand the situation of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead are not any more advanced than
animals. In the beginning of $rimad-Bhagavatam it is confirmed that even
though one performs the rituals of the Vedas, if he does not develop a
sense of Krsna consciousness, then all his labor in performing Vedic rituals
is considered to be simply a waste of time. Lord Siva’s aim in destroying
the Daksa yajia was to punish Daksa because by neglecting him (Lord
Siva), Daksa was committing a great offense. Lord Siva’s punishment
was just like that of a cowherd boy who keeps a stick to frighten his
animals. It is commonly said that to give protection to animals, a stick is
needed because animals cannot reason and argue. Their reasoning and argu-
ment is argumentum ad baculum; unless there is a rod, they do not obey.
Force is required for the animalistic class of men, whereas those who are
advanced are convinced by reasons, arguments and scriptural authority.


--- Page 220 ---
224 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 7
Persons who are simply attached to Vedic rituals, without further advance-
ment of devotional service or Krsna consciousness, are almost like animals,
and Lord Siva is in charge of giving them protection and sometimes
punishing them, as he punished Daksa.

and saved me by awarding punishment. 1 request that you be pleased by
your own mercy, since I cannot satisfy you by my words.
PURPORT
As usual, a devotee in an adverse condition of life accepts such a condi-
tion to be the mercy of the Lord. Factually, the insulting words used by
Daksa against Lord Siva were enough to have him thrown perpetually into
a hellish life. But Lord Siva, being kind toward him, awarded him punish-
ment to neutralize the offense. King Daksa realized this, and, feeling
obliged for Lord Siva’s magnanimous behavior, he wanted to show his


--- Page 221 ---
Text 16] The Sacrifice Performed by Daksa 225
gratitude to him. Sometimes a father punishes his child, and when the
child is grown up and comes to his senses, he understands that the
father’s punishment was not actually punishment but mercy. Similarly,
Daksa appreciated that the punishment offered to him by Lord Siva was a
manifestation of his mercy. That is the symptom of a person who is mak-
ing progress on the path of Krsna consciousness. It is said that a devotee in
Krsna consciousness never takes any miserable condition of life to be
condemnation by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He accepts the
miserable condition to be the grace of the Lord. He thinks, “I would have
been punished or put into a more dangerous condition of life due to my
past misdeeds, but the Lord has protected me. Thus I have received only a
little punishment as token execution of the law of karma.” Thinking of
His grace in that way, a devotee always surrenders to the Supreme Person-
ality of Godhead more and more seriously and is not disturbed by such
so-called punishment.

TRANSLATION
Thereafter, in order to resume the activities of sacrifice, the brahmanas
first of all arranged for purification of the contamination caused by the
touch of Virabhadra and other ghostly followers of Lord Siva. They then
arranged to offer the oblations known as purodasa into the fire.
PURPORT
Lord Siva’s followers and devotees, headed by Virabhadra, are known
as viras, and they are ghostly demons. Not only did they pollute the entire
sacrificial arena by their very presence, bul they disturbed the whole
situation by passing stool and urine. Therefore, the infection they had
created was to be first purified by the method of offering purodasa
oblations. A Visnu yajiia, or an offering to Lord Visnu, cannot be
performed uncleanly. If anything is offered in an unclean state, that is
called sevaparadha. The Visnu Deity worship in the temple is also Visnu
yajiia. In all Visnu temples, therefore, the priest who takes care of the
arcand-vidhi must be very clean. Everything should be always kept neat
and clean, and the foodstuffs should be prepared in a neat and clean
manner. All these regulative principles are described in The Nectar of
Devotion. There are thirty-two kinds of offenses in discharging arcana
service. It is required, therefore, that one should be extremely careful
not to be unclean. Generally, whenever any ritualistic ceremony is begun,
the holy name of Lord Vignu is first chanted in order to purify the situa-
tion. Whether one is in a pure or impure condition internally or externally,


--- Page 223 ---
Text 18] The Sacrifice Performed by Daksa 227
if one chants or even remembers the holy name of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead Vispu, he immediately becomes purified. The yajiia arena was
desecrated by the presence of Lord Siva’s followers, headed by Virabhadra,
and therefore the entire arena had to be sanctified. Although Lord Siva
was present and he is all-auspicious, it was still necessary to sanctify the
place because his followers had broken into the arena and committed so
many obnoxious acts. That sanctification was possible only by chanting
the holy name of Vignu, Trikapalam, which can sanctify the three worlds.
In other words, it is admitted herein that the followers of Lord Siva are
generally unclean. They are not even very hygienic; they do not take baths
regularly, they wear long hair, and they smoke gaiija. Persons of such
irregular habits are counted amongst the ghosts. Since they were present
in the sacrificial arena, the atmosphere became polluted, and it had to be
sanctified by offering trikapala oblations which indicated the invocation
of Vignu’s favor.

PURPORT

Lord Vignu is all-pervading. Any devotee who, in sanctified meditation,
following the regulative principles, chants the required mantras in service
and in a devotional mood can see Visnu. It is said in the Brahma-sanhita
that a devotee whose eyes are anointed with the ointment of love of
Godhead can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead always within his
heart. Lord Syamasundara is so kind to His devotee.

Text 21] The Sacrifice Performed by Daksa 229
TRANSLATION

His complexion was blackish, His garment was of a yellow color, like
gold, His helmet was as dazzling as the sun, His hair was bluish, the color
of black bees, and His face was decorated with earrings. His eight hands
held a conchshell, wheel, club, lotus flower, arrow, bow, shield and sword,
and they were decorated with golden ornaments such as bangles and
bracelets. His whole body resembled a blossoming tree beautifully
decorated with various kinds of flowers.

PURPORT

The face of Lord Vignu as described in this verse appears like a lotus
flower with bees humming over it. All of the ornaments on the body of
Lord Visnu are of molten gold of the reddish-gold color of the morning
sunrise. The Lord appears, just as the morning sun rises, to protect the
whole universal creation. His arms display different weapons, and His
eight hands are compared to the eight petals of a lotus flower. All the
weapons mentioned are for the protection of His devotees.

Generally in the four hands of Visnu there are a wheel, a club,
conchshell and lotus flower. These four symbols are seen in the four
hands of Visnu in different arrangements. The club and the wheel are
the Lord’s symbols of punishment for the demons and miscreants, and
the lotus flower and conchshell are used to benedict the devotees. There
are always two classes of men, the devotees and the demons. It is
confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (Bg. 4.8) that (paritranaya sadhiinam) the
Lord is always ready for the protection of the devotees and annihilation of
the demons. There are demons and devotees in this material world, but in
the spiritual world there is no such distinction. In other words, Lord
Visnu is the proprietor of both the material and spiritual worlds. In the
material world almost everyone is of the demoniac nature, but there are
also devotees, who appear to be in the material world although they are
always situated in the spiritual world. A devotee’s position is always
transcendental, and he is always protected by Lord Visnu.

TRANSLATION
Lord Visnu looked extraordinarily beautiful because the goddess of
fortune and a garland were situated on his chest. His face was beautifully
decorated with a smiling attitude which can captivate the entire world,
especially the devotees. White hair fans appeared on both sides of the Lord
like white swans, and the white canopy overhead looked like the moon.
PURPORT
The smiling face of Lord Visnu is pleasing to the whole world. Not only
devotees but even nondevotees are attracted by such a smile. This verse
nicely describes how the sun, moon, eight-petaled lotus flower and hum-
ming black bees were represented by the fans of hair, the overhead canopy,
the moving earrings on both sides of His face, and His blackish hair. All
together, accompanied by the conchshell, wheel, club, lotus flower, bow,
arrows, shield and sword in His hands, these presented a grand and
beautiful audience for Lord Vigsnu which captivated all the demigods
there, including Daksa and Lord Brahma.

TRANSLATION
As soon as Lord Visnu was visible, all the demigods—Lord Brahma and
Lord Siva, the Gandharvas and all present there—immediately offered
their respectful obeisances by falling down straight before Him.
PURPORT
It appears that Lord Visnu is the Supreme Lord even of Lord Siva and
Lord Brahma, what to speak of the demigods, Gandharvas and ordinary
living entities. It is stated in a prayer, yam brahma varunendra-rudra-
marutah: All of them, including the yogis, worship Lord Visnu. Bhyana-
vasthita tad-gatena manasa pasyanti yar yogino: Yogis concentrate their
minds on the form of Lord Visnu, and thus He is worshipable by all
demigods, all Gandharvas and even by Lord Siva and Lord Brahma.
Tad visnoh paramarm [00007 sada pasyanti surayah: Vispu is therefore the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even though Lord Siva was previously
referred to in prayers by Lord Brahma as the Supreme, when Lord Visnu
appeared, Siva also fell prostrated before Him to offer his respectful
obeisances.

In the presence of the glaring effulgence of the bodily luster of
Narayana, everyone else’s luster faded away, and everyone stopped
speaking. Fearful with awe and veneration, they touched their hands to
their heads and prepared to offer their prayers to the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, Adhoksaja.

TRANSLATION
Although the mental scope of even demigods like Brahma was unable to
comprehend the unlimited glories of the Supreme Lord, they were all able
to perceive the transcendental form of the Supreme Personality of God-
head by His grace. Only by such grace could they offer their respectful
prayers according to their different capacities.
PURPORT
The Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, is always unlimited,
and His glories cannot be completely enumerated by anyone, including
a personality like Lord Brahma. It is said that Ananta, a direct incarnation
of the Lord, has unlimited mouths, and with each mouth He has been
trying to describe the glories of the Lord for an unlimited span of time,
yet the glories of the Lord remain unlimited, and He therefore never
finishes. It is not possible for any ordinary living entity to understand or
to glorify the unlimited Personality of Godhead, but one can offer prayers
or service to the Lord according to one’s particular capacity. This capacity


--- Page 229 ---

is increased by the service spirit. Sevonmukhe hi jihvadau means that the
service of the Lord begins with the tongue. This refers to chanting. By
chanting Hare Krsna, one begins the service of the Lord. Another function
of the tongue is to taste and accept the Lord’s prasadam. We have to begin
our service to the Unlimited with the tongue and become perfect in chant-
ing and accepting the Lord’s prasadam. To accept the Lord’s prasadam
means to control the entire set of senses. The tongue is considered to be
the most uncontrollable sense because it hankers for so many unwholesome
eatables, thereby forcing the living entity into the dungeon of material
conditional life. As the living entity transmigrates from one form of life
to another, he has to eat so many abominable foodstuffs that finally
there is no limit. The tongue should be engaged in chanting and in
eating the Lord’s prasadam so that the other senses will be controlled.
Chanting is the medicine, and prasadam is the diet. With these processes
one can begin his service, and as the service increases, the Lord reveals
more and more to the devotee. But there is no limit to His glories, and
there is no limit to engaging oneself in the service of the Lord.

such personalities as Nanda and Sunanda.

material contamination because You are completely self-sufficient.

The priests addressed the Lord, saying: O Lord, transcendental to
material contamination, by the curse offered by Lord Siva’s men we have
become attached to fruitive activities, and thus we are now fallen and there-
fore do not know anything about You. On the contrary, we are now
involved in the injunctions of the three departments of the Vedic knowl-
edge under the plea of executing rituals in the name of yajia. We know
that You have made arrangements for distributing the respective shares
of the demigods.
PURPORT
The Vedas are known as traigunya-visaya vedah (Bg. 2.45). Those who
are serious students of the Vedas are very much attached to the ritualistic
ceremonies mentioned in the Vedas, and therefore these Vedavadis cannot
understand that the ultimate goal of the Vedas isto understand Lord Krsna

or Visnu. Those who have transcended the qualitative Vedic attractions,
however, can understand Krsna, who is never contaminated by the material
qualities. Therefore Lord Visnu is addressed here as anaiijana (free from
material contamination). In Bhagavad-gita the crude Vedic scholars have
been deprecated by Krsna as follows:

yam imam puspitam vacam pravadanty avipascitah

veda-vada-ratah partha nanyad astiti vadinah
“Men of small knowledge are very much attached to the flowery words of
the Vedas, and they say that there is nothing more than this.” (Bg. 2.42)

tional existence the time element, like a snake, is always looking for an
opportunity to strike. This world is full of ditches of so-called distress and
happiness, and there are many ferocious animals always ready to attack.
The fire of lamentation is always blazing, and the mirage of false happiness
is always alluring, but one has no shelter from them. Thus foolish persons
live in the cycle of birth and death, always overburdened in discharging
their so-called duties, and we do not know when they will accept the
shelter of Your lotus feet.
PURPORT

Persons who are nol in Krsna consciousness are living a very precarious
life, as described in this verse, but all these circumstantial conditions are
due to forgetfulness of Krsna. The Krsna consciousness movement is
meant to give relief to all these bewildered and distressed persons; therefore
it is the greatest relief work for all human society, and the workers thereof
are the greatest well-wishers, for they follow in the footsteps of Lord
Caitanya, who is the grealest friend to all living entities.

Lord Siva said: My dear Lord, my mind and consciousness are always
fixed on Your lotus feet, which, as the source of all benediction and the
fulfillment of all desires, are worshiped by all liberated great sages because
they are worthy of worship. With my mind fixed on Your lotus feet, I am
no longer disturbed by persons who blaspheme me, claiming that my
activities are not purified. I do not mind their accusations, and I excuse
them out of compassion, just as You exhibit compassion towards all living
entities.
PURPORT
Lord Siva expresses herein his regret at being angry and disturbing the
sacrificial activities of Daksa. King Daksa had insulted him in many ways,
and thus he had become angry and had frustrated the entire sacrificial
ceremony. Later, when he was pleased with them, the yajfia performances
were reinstituted, and therefore he regretted his activities. Now he says
that due to his mind’s being fixed on the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord,
Visnu, he is no longer disturbed by the ordinary critics of his way of life.
From this statement of Lord Siva it is understood that as long as one is on
the material platform he is affected by the three modes of material nature.
As soon as he is in Krsna consciousness, however, one is no longer affected
by such material activities. One should therefore always be fixed in Krsna
consciousness, busy in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. It is
guaranteed that such a devotee will never be affected by the actions and
reactions of the three modes of material nature. This fact is also
corroborated in Bhagavad-gita: Anyone who is fixed in the transcendental
service of the Lord has surpassed all the material qualities and is situated in
the status of Brahman-realization, in which one is not afflicted by
hankering for material objects. The recommendation of the Srimad-
Bhagavatam is that one should always be Krsna conscious and should
never forget his transcendental relationship with the Lord. This program
has to be followed strictly by everyone. From the statement of Lord Siva
it is understood that he was always in Krsna consciousness, and thus he
remained free from material affliction. The only remedy is, therefore, to
continue Krsna consciousness rigidly, in order to get out of the contamina-
tion of the material modes.

Sri Bhrgu said: My dear Lord, all living entities, beginning from the
highest, namely Lord Brahma, down to the ordinary ant, are under the
influence of the insurmountable spell of illusory energy, and thus they are
ignorant of their constitutional position. Everyone believes in the concept
of the body, and thus all are submerged in the darkness of illusion. They
are actually unable to understand how You live in every living entity as the
Supersoul, nor can they understand Your absolute position. But You are
the eternal friend and protector of all surrendered souls. Therefore,
please be kind towards us and forgive all our offenses.
PURPORT
Bhrgu Muni was conscious of the scandalous behavior exhibited by each
and every one of them, including Brahma and Lord Siva, in the sacrificial
ceremony of Daksa. By mentioning Brahma, the chief of all living entities
within this material world, he wanted to state that everyone, including
also Brahma and Lord Siva, is under the concept of the body and under
the spell of material energy—all but Vispu. That is the version of Bhrgu.
As long as one is under the concept of the body as self, it is very difficult
to understand the Supersoul or the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Conscious that he was not greater than Brahma, Bhrgu included himself in


--- Page 236 ---
240 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 7
the list of offenders. Ignorant personalities, or conditioned souls, have no
choice bul to accept their precarious condition under material nature. The
only remedy is to surrender to Visnu and always pray to be excused. One
should depend only on the causeless mercy of the Lord for deliverance and
not even slightly on one’s own strength. That is the perfect position of a
Krsna conscious person. The Lord is everyone’s friend, but He is especially
friendly to the surrendered soul. The simple process is, therefore, that a
conditioned soul should remain surrendered to the Lord, and the Lord
will give him all protection to keep him out of the clutches of material
contamination.

Lord Brahma said: My dear Lord, Your personality and eternal form
cannot be understood by any person who is trying to know You through
the different processes of acquiring knowledge. Your position is always
transcendental to the material creation, whereas the empiric attempt to
understand You is material, as are its objectives and instruments.


--- Page 237 ---
Text 32] The Sacrifice Performed by Daksa 241
PURPORT

It is said that the transcendental name, qualities, activities, paraphernalia,
etc., of the Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot be understood with
our material senses. The attempt of the empiric philosophers to understand
the Absolute Truth by speculation is always futile because their process of
understanding, their objective and the instruments by which they try to
understand the Absolute Truth are all material. The Lord is aprakrta,
beyond the creation of the material world. This fact is also accepted by
the great impersonalist Sankaricarya: narayapah paro ’vyaktad andam
avyakta-sambhavam. Avyakta, or the original material cause, is beyond
this material manifestation and is the cause of the material world. Because
Narayana, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is beyond the material
world, one cannot speculate upon Him by any material method. One has to
understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead simply by the transcen-
dental method of Krsna consciousness. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita
(Bg. 18.55). Bhaktya mam abhijanati: Only by devotional service can one
understand the transcendental form of the Lord. That is the difference
between the impersonalists and the personalists. The impersonalists,
limited by their speculative processes, cannot even approach the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, whereas the devotees please the Supreme Person-
ality of Godhead through His transcendental loving service. Sevonmukhe
hi: Due to the service attitude of the devotee, the Lord is revealed to him.
The Supreme lord cannot be understood by materialistic persons even
though He is present before them. In Bhagavad-gita, Lord Krsna therefore
condemns such materialists as midhas. Midha means rascal. It is said in
the Gita, “Only rascals think of Lord Krsna as an ordinary person. They
do not know what Lord Krsna’s position is or what His transcendental
potencies are.” Unaware of His transcendental potencies, the impersonal-
ists deride the person of Lord Krsna, whereas the devotees, by dint of
their service attitude, can understand Him as the Personality of Godhead.
In the Tenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gita, Arjuna also confirmed that it is
very difficult to understand the personality of the Lord.

TRANSLATION
King Indra said: My dear Lord, Your transcendental form with eight
hands and weapons in each of them appears for the welfare of the entire
universe, and it is very pleasing to the mind and eyes. In such a form Your
Lordship is always prepared to punish the demons, who are envious of
Your devotees.
PURPORT
It is generally understood from revealed scriptures that Lord Visnu
appears with four hands, but in this particular sacrificial arena Lord Visnu
arrived with eight hands. King Indra said, “Even though we are accustomed
to see Your four-handed Vignu form, still this appearance with eight hands
is as real as the four-handed form.” As Lord Brahma had said, to realize
the transcendental form of the Lord is beyond the power of the senses. In
reply to that statement of Brahma, King Indra here says that even though
the transcendental form of the Lord is not perceivable by the material
senses, His activities and His transcendental form can be understood. The
Lord’s uncommon features, uncommon activities and uncommon beauty
can be perceived even by an ordinary man. For example, when Lord Krsna
appeared just like a six- or seven-year-old boy in Vrndavana, He was
approached by the residents there. There were torrents of rain, and the
Lord saved the residents of Vrndavana by lifting Govardhana Hill and


--- Page 239 ---
Text 33] The Sacrifice Performed by Daksa 243
resting it on the little finger of His left hand for seven days. This
uncommon feature of the Lord should convince even materialistic persons
who want to speculate to the limit of their material senses. The activities
of the Lord are pleasing to experimental vision also, but impersonalists
will not believe in His identity because they study the personality of the
Lord by comparing their personality to His. Because men in this material
world cannot lift a hill, they therefore do not believe that the Lord can
lift one. They accept the statements of Srimad-Bhagavatam to be allegori-
cal, and they try to interpret them in their own way. But factually the
Lord lifted the hill in the presence of all the inhabitants of Vrndavana, as
corroborated by great dcaryas and authors like Vyasadeva and Narada.
Everything about the Lord—His activities, pastimes and uncommon
features—should be accepted as is, and in this way, even in our present
condition, we can understand the Lord. In the instance herein, King Indra
confirms: “Your presence with eight hands is as good as Your presence
with four hands.” There is no doubt about it.

TRANSLATION
The wives of the performers of the sacrifice said: My dear Lord, this
sacrifice was arranged under the instruction of Brahma, but unfortunately
Lord Siva, being angry at Daksa, devastated the entire scene, and because
of his anger the animals meant for sacrifice are lying dead. Therefore the
preparations of the yajiia have been lost. Now, by the glance of Your
lotus eyes, the sanctity of this sacrificial arena may be again invoked.
PURPORT
Animals were offered in sacrifice in order to give them renewed life; that
was the purpose of having animals there. Offering an animal in sacrifice
and giving him renewed life is the evidence of the strength of chanting
mantras. Unfortunately, when Daksa’s sacrifice was devastated by Lord
Siva, some of the animals were killed. (One was killed just to replace the
head of Daksa.) Their bodies were lying about, and the sacrificial arena
was turned into a crematorium. Thus the real purpose of yajiia was lost.
Lord Vignu, being the ultimate objective of such sacrificial ceremonies,
was requested by the wives of the priests to glance over the yajiia arena
with His causeless mercy so that the routine work of the yajiia might be
continued. The purport here is that animals should not be unnecessarily
killed. They were used to prove the strength of the mantras and were to
have been rejuvenated by the use of the mantras. They should not have
been killed, as they were by Lord Siva to replace the head of Daksa with
an animal’s head. It was pleasing to see an animal sacrificed and re-
juvenated, and that pleasing atmosphere had been lost. The wives of the
priests requested that the animals be brought back to life by the glance of
Lord Vignu to make a pleasing yajiia.

TRANSLATION

The sages prayed: Dear Lord, Your activities are most wonderful, and
although You do everything by Your different potencies, You are not at
all attached to such activities. You are not even attached to the goddess of
fortune, who is worshiped by the great demigods like Brahma, who pray
to achieve her mercy.

PURPORT

In Bhagavad-gita it is said that the Lord has no desire to achieve any
result from His wonderful activities, nor has He any need to perform
them. But still, in order to give an example to people in general, He
sometimes acts, and those activities are very wonderful. He is not attached
to anything. Na 7707 karmapi limpanti: Although He acts very wonder-
fully, He is not at all attached to anything (Bg. 4.14). lle is self-sufficient.
The example is given here that the goddess of fortune, Laksmi, is always
engaged in the service of the Lord, but still He is not attached to her.
Even great demigods like Brahma worship the goddess of fortune in order
to win her favor. And though the Lord is worshiped by many hundreds and
thousands of goddesses of fortune, still He is not at all attached to any one
of them. This distinction concerning the exalted transcendental position
of the Lord is specifically mentioned by the great sages: He is not like the
ordinary living entity, who is attached to the result of pious activities.

TRANSLATION
The Siddhas prayed: Like an elephant that has suffered in a forest fire
but can forget all its troubles by entering a river, our minds, O Lord,
always merge in the nectarean river of Your transcendental pastimes, and
they desire never to leave such transcendental bliss, which is as good as the
pleasure of merging in the Absolute.
PURPORT
This statement is from the Siddhas, the inhabitants of the Siddhaloka,
where the eight kinds of material perfection are complete. The residents
of Siddhaloka have full control in the eight kinds of yogic perfection, but
from their statement it appears that they are pure devotees. They always
merge in the nectarean river of hearing of the pastimes of the Lord. Hear-
ing of the pastimes of the Lord is called Krspa-katha. Similarly, there is a
statement by Prahlada Maharaja that those who are always merged in the
ocean of the nectar of describing the pastimes of the Lord are liberated.
They have no fear of the material condition of life. The Siddhas say that
the mind of an ordinary person is full of anxieties. The example is given of
the elephant who has suffered in a forest fire and who enters into a river to


--- Page 243 ---
Text 36] The Sacrifice Performed by Daksa 247
relieve himself. If persons who are suffering in the forest fire of this
material existence will only enter into the nectarean river of the description
of the pastimes of the Lord, they will forget all the troubles of the misera-
ble material existence. The Siddhas do not care for fruitive activities, such
as performing sacrifices and achieving the good results. They simply
merge in the transcendental discussions of the pastimes of the Lord. That
makes them completely happy, without care for pious or impious
activities. For those who are always in Krsna consciousness there is no
need to perform any kind of pious or impious sacrifices or activities.
Krsna consciousness is itself complete, for it includes all the processes
praised in the Vedic scriptures.

248 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 7
The sacrificial arena is not beautiful without You, just as a body is not
beautiful without the head.
PURPORT

Another name of Lord Visnu is Yajiiesvara. In Bhagavad-gita it is said
that all activities should be performed as Visnu yajiia, for the pleasure of
Lord Visnu. Unless we please Him, whatever we do is the cause of our
bondage in the material world. This is confirmed herein by the wife of
Daksa: “Without Your presence, the grandeur of this sacrificial ceremony
is useless, just as a body without the head, however decorated it may be,
is useless.” The comparison is equally applicable to the social body.
Material civilization is very proud of being advanced, but it is actually
the useless trunk of a body without a head. Without Krsna consciousness,
without an understanding of Visnu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
any advancement in a civilization, no matter how sophisticated, is of no
value. There is a statement in the Srimad-Bhdagavatam: bhagavad-bhakti-
hinasya jatih 525८707४ japas tapah aprapasyaiva dehasye mandanam loka-
raiijanam. The purport is that sometimes when a friend or relative dies,
especially amongst lower class men, the dead body is decorated. Dressed
and ornamented, the body is taken in procession. That sort of decoration
of the dead body has no actual value because the life force is already gone.
Similarly, any aristocracy, any social prestige or any advancement of
material civilization without Krsna consciousness is as good as the decora-
tion of a dead body. The name of the wife of Daksa was Prasuiti, and she
was the daughter of Svayambhuva Manu. Her sister, Devahiiti, was married
to Kardama Muni, and Kapiladeva, the Personality of Godhead, became
her son. Prasiiti, then, was the aunt of Lord Visnu. She was asking the
favor of Lord Visnu in an affectionate mode; since she was His aunt, she
sought some special favor. Also significant in this verse is that the Lord is
praised with the goddess of fortune. Wherever Lord Visnu is worshiped,
naturally there is the favor of the goddess of fortune. Lord Visnu is
addressed here as ৫7770, transcendental. The demigods, including Brahma
and Lord Siva, were produced after the creation, but Lord Vispu existed
before the creation. He is addressed, therefore, as amrta. Lord Vispu is
worshiped with His internal energy by the Vaisnavas. Prasiiti, the wife of
Daksa, implored the Lord to turn the priests into Vaisnavas instead of
simply fruitive workers performing sacrifices for some material benefits.

The governors of various planets spoke as follows: Dear Lord, we
believe only in our direct perception. But, under the circumstances, we do
not know whether we have actually seen You with our material senses.
By our material senses we can simply perceive the cosmic manifestation,
but You are beyond the five elements. You are the sixth. We see You,
therefore, as a creation of the material world.
PURPORT
The governors of the various planets are certainly very materially opulent
and puffed up. Such persons are unable to understand the transcendental
eternal form of the Lord. In the Brahma-sarhhita it is stated that only
persons who have anointed their eyes with love of Godhead can see the
Personality of Godhead in every step of their activities. Also, in the prayers
of Kunti it is stated (akiicana-gocaram) that only those who are not
materially puffed up can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead; others
are bewildered and cannot even think of the Absolute Truth. (Bhag. 1.8.26)

The great mystics said: Dear Lord, persons who see You as nondifferent

are certainly very, very dear to You. You are very favorable towards
those who engage in devotional service, accepting You as the Lord and
themselves as the servants. By Your mercy, You are always inclined in
their favor.
PURPORT
It is indicated in this verse that the monists and the great mystics know
the Supreme Personality of Godhead as one. This oneness is not the
misunderstanding that a living entity is equal in every respect to the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. This monism is based on pure knowledge
as described and confirmed in Bhagavad-gita: priyo hi jianino ’tyartham
ahariv sa ca mama priyah (Bg. 7.17). The Lord says that those who are
advanced in transcendental knowledge and know the science of Krsna
consciousness are very dear to Him, and He also is very dear to them.
Those who are actually in perfect knowledge of the science of God know
that the living entities are superior energy of the Supreme Lord. This is
stated in Bhagavad-gita, Seventh Chapter: The material energy is inferior,
and the living entities are superior energy. Energy and the energetic are


--- Page 247 ---
Text 39] The Sacrifice Performed by Daksa 251
nondifferent; therefore, energies possess the same quality as the energetic.
Persons who are in full knowledge of the Personality of Godhead,
analyzing His different energies and knowing their own constitutional
position, are certainly very, very dear to the Lord. Persons, however, who
may not even be conversant with knowledge of the Supreme Personality
but who always think of the Lord with love and faith, feeling that He is
great and that they are His parts and parcels, ever His servitors, are even
more favored by Him. The particular significance of this verse is that the
Lord is addressed as vatsala. Vatsala means always favorably disposed. The
Lord’s name is bhakta-vatsala. The Lord is famous as bhakta-vatsala, which
means that He is always favorably inclined to the devotees, whereas He is
never addressed anywhere in the Vedic literature as jiani-vatsala.

TRANSLATION

We offer our respectful obeisances unto the Supreme, who has created
varieties of manifestations and put them under the spell of the three
qualities of the material world in order to create, maintain and annihilate
them. He Himself is not under the control of the external energy; in His
personal feature He is completely devoid of the variegated manifestation
of material qualities, and He is under no illusion of false identification.


--- Page 248 ---
252 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 7
PURPORT

Two situations are described in this verse. One is the creation, main-
tenance and annihilation of the material world, and the other is the Lord’s
own establishment. There is also quality in the Lord’s own establishment,
thekingdom of God. It is stated here that Goloka is His personal situation.
There is also quality in Goloka, but that quality is not divided into
creation, maintenance and annihilation. In the external energy, the inter-
action of the three qualities makes it possible for things to be created,
maintained and annihilated. But in the spiritual world, or the kingdom of
God, there is no such exhibition, since everything is eternal, sentient and
blissful. There is a class of philosophers who misunderstand the appearance
of the Personality of Godhead within this material world. They are under
the impression that when the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears, He
is under the spell of the three qualities, like all the other living entities
who appear within this material world. That is their misunderstanding; as
it is clearly stated here (svasamsthaya), by His internal potency He is
transcendental to all these material qualities. Similarly, in Bhagavad-gita
the Lord says, “1 appear by My internal potency.” Both the internal and
external potencies are under the control of the Supreme, so He does not
come under the control of either of these potencies. Rather, everything is
under His control. In order to manifest His transcendental name, form,
quality, pastimes and paraphernalia, He brings into action His internal
energy. On account of the variegatedness of the external potency, there
are manifestations of many qualitative demigods, beginning with Brahma
and Lord Siva, and people are attracted to these demigods according to
their own material quality. But when one is transcendental or surpasses
the material qualities, he is simply fixed in the worship of the Supreme
Personality. This fact is explained in Bhagavad-gita: Anyone engaged in
the service of the Lord is already transcendental to the variegatedness and
interaction of the three material qualities. The summary is that the con-
ditioned souls are being pulled on by the action and reaction of the
material qualities, which create a differentiation of energies. But in the
spiritual world the worshipable one is the Supreme Lord and no one else.

TRANSLATION

The personified Vedas said: We offer our respectful obeisances unto
You, the Lord, the shelter of the quality of goodness and therefore
the source of all religion, austerity and penance, for You are nevertheless
transcendental to all material qualities, and no one knows You or Your
actual situation.

PURPORT

In the material world there is the trinity of the three material qualities.
Lord Visnu has accepted the superintendence of the quality of goodness,
which is the source of religion, knowledge, austerity, renunication,
opulence, etc. Because of this, actual peace, prosperity, knowledge and
religion can be attained when the living entities are under the control of
the quality of goodness in the material world. As soon as they are
subjected to the control of the other two qualities, namely passion and
ignorance, their precarious conditional life becomes intolerable. But
Lord Visnu, in His original position, is always nirguna, which means
transcendental to these material qualities. Guna means quality, and nir
means negation. This does not indicate, however, that He has no qualities;
He has transcendental qualities by which He appears and manifests His
pastimes. The positive transcendental qualitative manifestation is unknown
to the students of the Vedas as well as to the great stalwart demigods like
Brahma and Siva. Actually, the transcendental qualities are manifested
only to the devotees. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita, simply by dis-
charging devotional service one can understand the transcendental
position of the Supreme Lord. Those who are in the mode of goodness
can partially enter into the transcendental understanding, but it is advised


--- Page 250 ---
254 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 7
in Bhagavad-gita that one has to surpass this. The Vedic principles are
based on the three qualities of the material modes. One has to transcend
the three qualities, and then one can be situated in pure and simple
spiritual life.

The fire-god said: My dear Lord, I offer my respectful obeisances unto
You because by Your favor I am as luminous as blazing fire and I accept
the offerings mixed with butter and offered in sacrifice. The five kinds of
offerings according to the Yajur Veda are all Your different energies, and
You are worshiped by five kinds of Vedic hymns. Sacrifice means Your
Supreme Personality of Godhead.
PURPORT
In Bhagavad-gita it is clearly said that yajiia should be performed for
Lord Visnu. Lord Visnu has one thousand popular transcendental names,
out of which one name is Yajiia. It is clearly said that everything should
be done for the satisfaction of Yajfia or ছাড়া. All other actions which a


--- Page 251 ---
Text 42] The Sacrifice Performed by Daksa 255
person may take are only causes for his bondage. Everyone has to perform
yajiia according to the Vedic hymns. As stated in the Veda Upanisad,
fire, the altar, the auspicious full moon, the period of four months called
Caturmdsya, the sacrificial animal and the beverage called soma are neces-
sary requisites, as are the specific hymns mentioned in the Vedas and
composed of four letters. One hymn is as follows: asravayeti catur-aksararn
astu srausad iti catur-aksaram yajeti dvabhyam ye yajamahah. These mantras,
chanted according to the sruti and smprti literatures, are only to please
Lord Visnu. For the deliverance of those who are materially conditioned
and attached to material enjoyment, performing yajiia and following the
rules and regulations of the four divisions of society and of spiritual life
are recommended. It is said in the Visnu Purana that by offering sacrifice
to Visnu one can gradually be liberated. The whole target of life, therefore,
is to please Lord Visnu. That is yajiia. Any person who is in Krsna con-
sciousness has dedicated his life for the satisfaction of Krsna, the origin of
all Visnu forms, and by offering worship and prasadam daily, he becomes
the best performer of yajiia. In the Srimad-Bhagavatam it is clearly stated
that in this age of Kali the only successful performance of yajiia or sacri-
fice is yajiiaih sankirtana-prayaih; the best type of sacrifice is simply to
chant Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare
Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. This yajiia is performed before the form of
Lord Caitanya, as other yajiias are performed before the form of Lord Vignu.
These recommendations are found in the Eleventh Canto of the Srimad-
Bhagavatam. Moreover, this yajiia performance confirms that Lord
Caitanya Mahaprabhu is Visnu Himself. As Lord Visnu appeared at the
Daksa yajiia long, long ago, similarly Lord Caitanya has appeared in this
age to accept our sankirtana-yajiia.

TRANSLATION

The demigods said: Dear Lord, formerly, when there was a devastation,
You conserved all the different energies of material manifestation. At that
time all the inhabitants of the higher planets, represented by such
liberated souls as Sanaka, were meditating on You by philosophical
speculation. You are therefore the Original Person, and You rest in the
water of devastation on the bed of the Sesa snake. Now, today, You are
visible to us, who are all Your servants. Please give us protection.

PURPORT

The devastation indicated in this verse is the partial devastation of the
lower planets within the universe at the time when Lord Brahma goes to
sleep. The higher planetary systems, beginning with Janaloka, Maharloka
and Tapoloka, are not inundated at the time of this devastation. The Lord
is the creator, as indicated in this verse, because the energies of creation
are manifested through His body, and after annihilation, He conserves all
the energy within His abdomen.

Another significant point in this verse is that the demigods said,
“We are all Your servants [bhrtyan]. Give us Your protection.” The
demigods depend on the protection of Vignu; they are not independent.
Bhagavad-gita, therefore, condemns the worship of demigods because
there is no need of it and clearly states that only those who have lost their
sense go asking favors of the demigods. Generally, if anyone has material
desire to be fulfilled, he can ask Vigpu instead of going to the demigods.


--- Page 253 ---
Text 43] The Sacrifice Performed by Daksa 257
Those who worship demigods are not very intelligent. Besides that, the
demigods say, “We are Your eternal servants.” So those who are servants,
or devotees of the Lord, are not very much concerned with fruitive
activities, the performance of the prescribed yajiias or mental speculation.
They simply serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead sincerely, with
love and faith, performing everything with that loving service, and the
Lord gives such devotees direct protection. In Bhagavad-gita Lord Krsna
says, “Simply surrender unto Me, and I will give you protection from all
the reactions of sinful activities.” This material world is so created that one
has to act sinfully, knowingly or unknowingly, and unless his life is
dedicated to Visnu, he has to suffer all the reactions of sinful activities.
But one who surrenders and dedicates his life for the service of the Lord
has direct protection from the Lord. He has no fear of suffering from
sinful activities, nor does he desire, willingly or unwillingly, to do
anything which is sinful.

TRANSLATION

The Gandharvas said: Dear Lord, all the demigods, including Lord Siva
and Lord Brahma and the great sages Marici and Indra, are all only
differentiated parts and parcels of Your body. You are the Supreme
Almighty Great; the whole creation is just like a plaything for You. We
always accept You as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and we offer
our respectful obeisances unto You.

PURPORT

In the Brahma-sarhhita it is said that Krsna is the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. There may be many gods, from Brahma, Lord Siva, Indra
and Candra down to the rulers of the lower planetary systems, the
presidents, ministers, chairmen and kings. In fact, anyone can think that
he is God. That is the false, puffed up conviction of material life. Actually
Visnu is the Supreme Lord, but there is even one above Visnu, for Visnu
is also the plenary portion of a part of Krsna. In this verse this is referred
to by the word amsamsah, which means part and parcel of a part and
parcel. There are similar verses in the Caitanya-caritamrta which indicate
that the Supreme Lord’s parts and parcels again expand into other parts
and parcels. As described in Srimad-Bhagavatam, there are many manifes-
tations of Visnu and many manifestations of living entities. Visnu manifes-
tations are called svarisa, partial manifestations, and the living entities are
called vibhinnamsa. The demigods like Brahma and Indra have been pro-
moted to such exalted positions by pious activities and austerities, but
actually Visnu, or Krsna, is the master of everyone. In the Caitanya-
caritamrta it is said, ekale isvara krsna, are saba bhrtya. This means that
Krsna alone is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and all others, even the
vignu-tattva and certainly the living entities, are His servitors. Baladeva is
the immediate expansion of Krsna. He also engages in the service of Krsna,
and certainly the ordinary living entities are serving. Everyone is created,
constitutionally, for serving Krsna. Here the Gandharvas acknowledge that
although the demigods may represent themselves as the Supreme, actually
they are not supreme. Real supremacy belongs to Krsna. Krsnas tu
bhagavin svayam is the statement of Srimad-Bhagavatam: “Krsna is the
only Supreme Lord.” Worship of Krsna alone, therefore, includes worship
of all the parts and parcels, just as watering the root of a tree also waters
all the branches, twigs, leaves and flowers.

TRANSLATION
The Vidyadharas said: Dear Lord, this human form of body is for
attaining the highest perfectional objective, but, impelled by Your external
energy, the living entity misidentifies himself with his body and with the
material energy, and, therefore, influenced by maya, he wants to become
happy by material enjoyment. He is misled and is always attracted by
temporary, illusory happiness. But Your transcendental activities are so
powerful that if one engages in the hearing and chanting of such topics, he
can be delivered from illusion.
PURPORT
The human form of life is called arthadam because the body can very
nicely help the embodied soul to achieve the highest perfection. Prahlada
Maharaja said that even though it is temporary, the body can give us the


--- Page 256 ---
260 Srimad-Bhagavatam [ Canto 4, Ch. 7
highest perfectional achievement. In the process of evolution from the
lower to the higher grade of living, the human form of life is a great boon.
But madya is so strong that in spite of achieving this great boon of the
human form of life, we are influenced by temporary material happiness,
and we forget our goal of life. We are attracted by things which will cease
to exist. The beginning of such attraction is the temporary body. In this
horrible condition of life there is only one way of liberation—to engage in
the activities of transcendental chanting and hearing of the holy name of
the Supreme Lord: Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/
Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. The words yusmat-
kathampyta-nigevaka mean ‘‘those who engage in relishing the nectar of the
topics of Your Lordship.” There are two narrative books which especially
concern the words and activities of Krsna. Bhagavad-gita is the instruction
given by Krsna, and Srimad-Bhagavatam is the book conlaining topics
exclusively about Krsna and His devotees. These two books are the special
nectar of the words of Krsna. For those who engage in the preaching of
these two Vedic literatures it is very easy to get out of the illusory condi-
tional life imposed upon us by maya. The illusion is that the conditioned
soul does not try to understand his spiritual identity. lle is more interested
in his external body, which is only a flash and which will be finished as
soon as the time is designated. The whole atmosphere will change when the
living entity has to transmigrate from one body to another. Under the spell
of maya, he will again be satisfied in a different atmosphere. This spell of
maya is called avarapatmika-sakti because it is so strong that the living
entity is satisfied in any abominable condition. Even if he is born as a
worm living within the intestine or abdomen in the midst of urine and
stool, still he is satisfied. This is the covering influence of mdya. But the
human form of life is a chance to understand, and if one misses this oppor-
tunity, he is most unfortunate. The way to get out of illusory maya is to
engage in the (00168 of Krsna. Lord Caitanya advocated a process
whereby everyone may remain in his present position without change
but simply hear from the proper authoritative sources about Krsna.
Lord Caitanya advised everyone to spread the word of Krsna. He advised,
“All of you become spiritual masters. Your duty is simply to talk to
whomever you meet of Krsna or of the instructions given by Krsna.” The
International Society for Krishna Consciousness is operating for this
purpose: we do not ask anyone to first change his position and then come
to us; we invite everyone to come with us and simply chant Hare Krsna,
Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama,
Hare Hare, because we know that if one simply chants and hears the topics

of Krsna, one’s life will change; he will see a new light, and his life will be
successful.

TRANSLATION

The brahmanas said: Dear Lord, You are sacrifice personified, You are
the offering of clarified butter, You are the fire, You are the chanting of
Vedic hymns by which the sacrifice is conducted, You are the fuel, You
are the flame, You are the kusa grass, You are the sacrificial pots, You are
the priests who perform the yajiia, You are the demigods headed by Indra,
and You are the sacrificial animal. Everything that is sacrificed is You or
Your energy.

PURPORT

In this statement Lord Vispu’s all-pervasiveness is partially explained. It
is said in the Vispu Purana that as a fire situated in one place emanates its
heat and illumination everywhere, so whatever we see within the material


--- Page 258 ---
262 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 7
or spiritual worlds is also nothing but a manifestation of different energies
emanating from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The brahmapas’
statement is that Lord Visnu is everything—the fire, the offering, the
clarified butter, the utensils, the place of sacrifice and the kusa. He is
everything. It is confirmed herein that the performance of sankirtana-
yajiia in this age is as good as all other yajiias in all other ages. If one per-
forms sankirtana-yajiia by chanting Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna,
Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, there is no
need to arrange elaborate paraphernalia for the prescribed sacrificial cere-
monies recommended in the Vedas. In the chant of the holy names, Hare
and Krsna, flare means the energy of Krsna, and Krsna is the visnu-tattva.
Combined together they arc everything. In this age, persons arc harassed
by the influence of Kali-yuga and cannot arrange for all the requisite
paraphernalia for performing sacrifice as reccommended in the Vedus. But
if one simply chants Hare Krsna, it is to be understood that he is perform-
ing all kinds of yajiia because there is nothing within our vision except
Hare, the energy of Krsna, and Krsna. There is no difference between
Krsna and His energies. Thus since everything is a manifestation of His
energy, it is to be understood that everything is Krsna. One simply has to
accept everything in Krsna consciousness, and he is a liberated person. He
should not misunderstand that because everything is Krsna, Krsna has no
personal identity. Krsna is so full that in spite of kecping Himself separate
from everything by His energy, He is everything. This is confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita, Ninth Chapter. He is spread throughout the creation as
everything, but still He is not everything. The philosophy recommended
by Lord Caitanya is that He is simultaneously one and different.

TRANSLATION
Dear Lord, O personified Vedic knowledge, in the past millennium,
long, long ago, when You appeared as the great boar incarnation, You
picked up the world from the water as an elephant picks up a lotus flower
from a lake. When You vibrated transcendental sound in that gigantic
boar form, it was accepted as a sacrificial hymn, and great sages like
Sanaka meditated upon it and offered prayers for Your glorification.
PURPORT
A significant word used in this verse is trayigatra, which means that the
transcendental form of the Lord is the Vedas. Anyone who engages in the
worship of the Deity, or the form of the Lord in the temple, is under-
stood to be studying all the Vedas twenty-four hours a day. Simply by
decorating the Deities of the Lord, Radha and Krsna, in the temple, one
very minutely studies the injunctions of the Vedas. Even a neophyte
devotee who simply engages in the worship of the Deity is understood to
be in direct touch with the purport of Vedic knowledge. As confirmed in
Bhagavad-gild, vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah: the purport of the Vedas
is to understand Him, Krsna. One who worships and serves Krsna directly
has understood the truths of the Vedas.

Dear Lord, we were awaiting Your audience because we have been
unable to perform the yajiias according to the Vedic rituals. We pray
unto You, therefore, to be pleased with us. Simply by chanting Your holy
name, one can surpass all obstacles. We offer our respectful obeisances
unto You in Your presence.
PURPORT
The brahmana priests were very hopeful that their sacrifice would be
carried out without obstacles now that Lord Visnu was present. It is
significant in this verse that the brahmanas say, “Simply by chanting Your
holy name we can surpass the obstacles, but now You are personally
present.” The performance of ygjiia by Daksa was obstructed by the
disciples and followers of Lord Siva. The brahmanas indirectly criticized
the followers of Lord Siva, but because the brahmapas were always
protected by Lord Visnu, Siva’s followers could not do any harm to their
prosecution of the sacrificial process. There is a saying that when Krsna
protects someone, no one can do him harm, and when Krsna wants to
kill someone, no one can protect him. The vivid example was Ravana.
Ravana was a great devotee of Lord Siva, but when Lord Ramacandra
wanted to kill him, Lord Siva could not protect him. If some demigod,
even Lord Siva or Lord Brahma, wants to do harm to a devotee, Krsna
protects the devotee. But when Krsna wants to kill someone, such as
Ravana or Hiranyakasipu, no demigod can protect him.

Maitreya continued: My dear sinless Vidura, Lord Visnu is actually the
enjoyer of the results of all sacrifices. Still, because of His being the
Supersoul of all living entities, He was satisfied simply with His share
of the sacrificial offerings. He therefore addressed Daksa in a pleasing
attitude.

PURPORT

In Bhagavad-gita it is said, bhoklaram yajiia-tapasim: Lord Visnu, or
Krsna, is the supreme enjoyer of all the results of sacrifices, austerities
and penances; in whatever one may engage, the ultimate goal is Visnu. If
he does not know that, a person is misled. As the Supreme Personality of


--- Page 262 ---
266 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 7
Godhead, Visnu has nothing to demand from anyone. He is self-satisfied,
self-sufficient, but He accepts the offerings of yajiia because of His
friendly attitude toward all living entities. When His share of the sacrificial
results was offered to Him, He appeared to be very pleased. It is said in
Bhagavad-gita (9.26), patrarh puspari phalarh toyarh yo me bhaktya
prayacchati: if any devotee offers Him even a small leaf, or a flower or
water, if it is done with love and affection, the Lord accepts it and is
pleased. Although He is self-sufficient and does not need anything from
anyone, He accepts such offerings because, as Supersoul, He has such a
friendly attitude towards all living entities. Another point here is that He
does not encroach upon another’s share. In the yajiia there is a share for
the demigods, Lord Siva and Lord Brahma, and a share for Lord Visnu.
He is satisfied with His own share and does not encroach upon others’.
Indirectly, He indicated that He was not satisfied with Daksa’s trying to
deny Lord Siva his share. Maitreya addressed Vidura as sinless because
Vidura was a pure Vaisnava and never committed any offense to any
demigod. Although Vaisnavas accept Lord Visnu as the Supreme, they are
not prone to offend demigods. They give them proper respect. Vaignavas
accept Lord Siva as the best Vaisnava. For a Vaisnava there is no
possibility of offending any demigods, and the demigods are also pleased
with the Vaignava because they are faultless devotees of Lord Visnu.

Text 51] The Sacrifice Performed by Daksa 267
But impersonally there is no difference between Brahma, Lord Siva and
Myself.

PURPORT

Lord Brahma was born out of the transcendental body of Lord Visnu,
and Lord Siva was born out of the body of Brahma. Lord Visnu is,
therefore, the supreme cause. In the Vedas also it is stated that in the
beginning there was only Visnu, Narayana, but there was no Brahma or
Siva. Similarly, Safkaracarya confirmed this: ndrayapah parah. Narayana,
or Lord Vignu, is the origin, and Brahma and Siva are manifested after
creation. Lord Visnu is also @atmesvara, the Supersoul in everyone. Under
His direction, everything is prompted from within. For example, in the
beginning of the ওয় Bhagavatam it is stated, tene brahma 11702: He
first educated Lord Brahma from within.

In Bhagavad-gita Lord Krsna states, aham adir hi devanam: Lord Visnu,
or Krsna, is the origin of all demigods, including Lord Brahma and
Lord Siva. In another place in Bhagavad-gita Krsna states, aha sarvasya
prabhavah: “Everything is generated from Me.” This includes all the
demigods. Similarly, in the Vedanta-sitra: janmadyasya yatah. And in the
Upanisads is the statement, yato va imdni bhitani jiyante. Everything is
generated from Lord Visnu, everything is maintained by Him, and
everything is annihilated by His energy. Therefore, by their actions and
reactions, the energies which come from Him create the cosmic manifes-
tations, and they also dissolve the whole creation. Thus the Lord is the
cause and also the effect. Whatever effect we see is the interaction of His
energy. And because the energy is generated from Him, He is both cause
and effect. Simultaneously, everything is different and the same. 11 is said
that everything is Brahman: sarvar khalv 8007 brahma. In the highest
vision, nothing is beyond Brahman, and therefore Lord Brahma and
Lord Siva are certainly nondifferent from Him.

TRANSLATION

The Lord continued: My dear Daksa Dvija, I am the original Personality
of Godhead, but in order to create, maintain and annihilate this cosmic
manifestation, 1 act through My material energy, and according to the
different grades of activity, My representations are differently named.

PURPORT

As explained in Bhagavad-gita (7.5), jiva-bhiitam mahabaho: the whole
world is energy released from the supreme source, the Personality of
Godhead, who, it is further stated in Bhagavad-gita, acts in superior
energies and inferior energies. The superior energy is the living entity,
who is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. As parts and parcels, the
living entities are not different from the Supreme Lord; the energy ema-
nated from Him is not different from Him. But in the actual activity of
this material world, the living entity is under the different qualities of
material energy and in different forms. There are 8,400,000 life forms.
The same living entity acts under the influence of the different qualities of
material nature. The entities have different bodies, but originally, in the
beginning of creation, Lord Vispu is alone. For the pr क of creation,
Brahma is manifested, and for annihilation there is Lord Siva. As far as the
spiritual entrance into the material world is concerned, all beings are part
and parcel of the Supreme Lord, but under the covering of different
material qualities they have different names. Lord Brahma and Lord Siva
are qualitative incarnations of Visnu, as gupavataras, and Visnu with them
accepts control of the quality of goodness; therefore He is also a qualita-
tive incarnation like Lord Siva and Lord Brahma. Actually the different
names exist for different directions, otherwise the origin is one only.

The Lord continued: One who is not in proper knowledge thinks that

PURPORT
The living entities, including Brahma, are not independently separated,
but are counted within the marginal potency of the Supreme Lord. The
Supreme Lord, being the Supersoul in every living entity, including Lord
Brahmi and Lord Siva, is directing everyone in the activities of the material
modes of nature. No one can act independently of the sanction of the
Lord, and therefore, indirectly, no one is different from the Supreme
Person, and certainly Brahma and Rudra, who are incarnations of the
material modes of nature, passion and ignorance, are not.

the all-pervading Personality of Godhead, from any thing or any living
entity.
PURPORT
Whenever there is disease in any part of the body, the whole body takes
care of the ailing part. Similarly, a devotee’s oneness is manifested in His
compassion for all conditioned souls. Bhagavad-gita says, panditah sama-
dar§inah: those who are learned see everyone’s conditional life equally
(Bg. 5.18). Devotees are compassionate to every conditioned soul, and
therefore they are known as aparakya-buddhi. Because devotees are learned
and know that every living entity is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord,
they preach Krsna consciousness to everyone so that they may be happy.
If a particular part of the body is diseased, the whole attention of the body
goes to that part. Similarly, devotees care for any person who is forgetful
of Krsna and therefore in material consciousness. The equal vision of the
devotee is that he works to get all living entities back home, back to
Godhead.

TRANSLATION
The Lord continued: One who does not consider Brahma, Visnu, Siva
or the living entities in general to be separate from the Supreme, and who
knows Brahman, actually realizes peace; others do not.
PURPORT
Two words are very significant in this verse. Traydpam indicates three,
namely Lord Brahma, Lord Siva and Lord Visnu. Bhiddim means different.

Text 55] The Sacrifice Performed by Daksa 271
They are three, and therefore they are separate, but at the same time they
are one. This is the philosophy of simultaneous oneness and difference,
which is called acintya-bhedabheda-tattva. The cxample given in the
Brahma-sarnhita is that milk and yogurt are simultaneously one and dif-
ferent; both are milk, but the yogurt has become changed. In order to
achieve real peace, one should see everything and every living entity,
including Lord Brahma and Lord Siva, as nondifferent from the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. No one is independent. Every one of us is an
expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This accounts for unity
in diversity. There are diverse manifestations, but, at the same time, they
are one in Vignu. Everything is an expansion of Visnu’s energy.

The sage Maitreya said: Thus Daksa, the head of all Prajapatis, having
been nicely instructed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, worshiped
Lord Visnu, and after worshiping Him by performing the prescribed
sacrificial ceremonies, he also worshiped Lord Brahma and Lord Siva
separately.
PURPORT
Lord Visnu should be offered everything, and His prasadam should be dis-
tributed to all other demigods. This practice is still followed in the temple of
Jagannidtha at Puri. There are many temples of demigods around the main
temple of Jagannatha, and the prasadam which is offered first to


--- Page 268 ---
272 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 7
Jagannatha is distributed to all the demigods. The deity of Bhagalin is
worshiped with the prasadam of Visnu, and also, in the famous Lord Siva
temple of Bhuvanesvara, the prasadam of Lord Visnu or Lord Jagannatha
is offered to the deity of Lord Siva. This is the Vaisnava principle. The
Vaisnava does not deride even ordinary living entities, including the small
ant; everyone is offered proper respect according to his position. The
offering, however, is in relation to the center, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Krsna, or Visnu. The devotee who is highly elevated sees the
relationship to Krsna in everything; he does not see anything as being
independent of Krsna. That is his vision of oneness.

With all respect, Daksa worshiped Lord Siva with his share of the
remnants of the yajna. After finishing the ritualistic sacrificial activities,
he satisfied all other demigods and the other people assembled there. After
finishing all these duties with the priests, he took a bath and was fully
satisfied.
PURPORT
Lord Rudra, Siva, was properly worshiped with his share of the rem-
nants of the yajiia. Yajha is Visnu, and whatever prasadam is offered to

are offered to all the demigods and others.

TRANSLATION
Thus worshiping the Supreme Lord Visnu by the ritualistic per-
formance of sacrifice, Daksa was completely situated on the religious
path. Besides that, all the demigods who had assembled at the sacrifice
blessed him that he might increase his religiosity, and then they left.
PURPORT
Although Daksa was considerably advanced in religious principles, he
awaited the blessings of the demigods. Thus the great sacrifice conducted
by Daksa ended in harmony and peace.

Ambika [goddess Durga], who was known as Daksayani [Sati], again
accepted Lord Siva as her husband, just as different energies of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead act during the course of a new creation.
PURPORT
According to the verse of the Vedic mantras, parasya saktir vividhaiva अच ~
yate: the Supreme Personality of Godhead has different varieties of energies.
Sakti is feminine, and the Lord is purusa, masculine. It is the duty of the fe-
male to serve under the supreme purusa. As stated in Bhagavad-gita, all living
entities are marginal energies of the Supreme Lord. It is the duty of all


--- Page 271 ---
Text 61] The Sacrifice Performed by Daksa 275
living entities to serve this Supreme Person. Durga is the representation in
the material world of both the marginal and external energies, and Lord
Siva is the representation of the Supreme Person. The connection of Lord
Siva and Ambika, or Durga, is eternal. Sati could not accept any husband
but Lord Siva. How Lord Siva remarried Durga as Himavati, the daughter
of the Himalayas, and how Karttikeya was born, is a great story in itself.

The great sage Maitreya concluded: If one hears and again narrates, with
faith and devotion, this story of the Daksa Yajna as it was conducted by
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu, then certainly he is cleared
of all contamination of material existence, O son of Kuru.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fourth Canto, Seventh
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “The Sacrifice Performed
by Daksa.”

TRANSLATION
The great sage Maitreya said: The four great Kumara sages headed by
Sanaka, as well as Narada, Rbhu, Hamsa, Aruni and Yati, all sons of
Brahma, did not live at home, but became airdhva-reta or naisthika-
brahmacaris, unadulterated celibates.
PURPORT
The system of brahmacarya has been current since the birth of Brahma.
A section of the population, especially male, did not marry at all. Instead
of allowing their semina to be driven downwards, they used to lift the
279


--- Page 274 ---
280 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 8
semina up to the brain. They are called @rdhva-retah, those who lift up.
Semina is so important that if, by the yogic process, one can lift the
semina up to the brain, he can perform wonderful work—one’s memory
is enabled to act very swiftly, and the duration of life is increased. Yogis
can thus perform all kinds of austerity with steadiness and can be elevated
to the highest perfectional stage, even to the spiritual world. Vivid examples
of brahmacaris who accepted this principle of life are the four sages
Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanatana and Sanat-kumara, as well as Narada and
others.

Another significant phrase here is naite grhan hy avasan, “they did not
live at home.” Grha means home as well as wife. In fact, home means
wife; home does not mean a room or a house. One who lives with a wife
lives at home, otherwise a sannyasi or brahmacari, even though he may
live in a room or in a house, does not live at home. That they did not live
at home means that they did not accept a wife, and so there was no
question of their discharging semina. Semina is meant to be discharged
when one has a home, a wife and the intention to beget children, otherwise
there is no injunction for discharging semina. These principles were
followed from the beginning of creation, and such brahmacaris never
created progeny. This narration deals with the descendants of Lord
Brahma from Manu’s daughter Prasiiti. Prasuti’s daughter was Daksayani
or Sati, in relation to whom the story of the Daksa yajiia was narrated.
Maitreya is now explaining about the progeny of the sons of Brahma. Out
of the many sons of Brahma, the brahmacari sons headed by Sanaka and
Narada did not marry at all, and therefore there is no question of
narrating the history of their descendants.

TRANSLATION

Irreligion was also Brahma’s son, and his wife’s name was Falsity. From
their combination, two demons named Dambha, or Bluffing, and Maya, or
Cheating, were born, and they were taken by a demon named Nirrti, who
had no children.

PURPORT

It is understood herein that Adharma, Irreligion, was also a son of
Brahma, and he married his sister Mrsa. This is the beginning of sex life
between brother and sister. This unnatural combination of sex life can be
possible in human society only where there is Adharma, Irreligion. It is
understood that in the beginning of creation Brahma created not only
saintly sons like Sanaka, Sanatana and Narada but also demonic offspring
like Nirrti, Adharma, Dambha and Falsity. Everything was created by
Brahma in the beginning. Regarding Narada, it is understood that because
his previous life was very pious and his association was very good, he was
therefore born as Narada. Others were also born in their own capacities,
according to their backgrounds. The law of karma continues birth after
birth, and when there is a new creation, the same karma comes back with
the living entities. They are born in different capacities according to karma
even though their father is originally Brahma, who is the exalted qualita-
tive incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION

My dear Vidura, I have summarily explained the causes of devastation,
and one who hears this description three times attains piety and washes
the sinful contamination from his soul.

PURPORT

The creation takes place on the basis of goodness, but devastation takes
place because of irreligion. That is the way of material creation and devas-
tation. Here it is stated that the cause of devastation is Adharma, or
Irreligion. The descendants of Irreligion and Falsity, born one after
another, are Bluffing, Cheating, Greed, Cunning, Quarrel, Envy, Harsh
Speech, Death, Severe Pain and Hell. All these descendants are described as
signs of devastation. If a person is pious and hears about these causes of
devastation, he will feel hatred for all these, and that will cause his
advancement in a life of piety. Piety refers to the cleansing process of the
heart. As recommended by Lord Caitanya, one has to cleanse the dust on
the mirror of the mind, and then advancement on the path of liberation
begins. Here also the same process is recommended. Malam means
contamination. We should learn to despise all the causes of devastation,
beginning from irreligion and cheating, and then we shall be able to make
advancement in a life of piety. The possibility of our attaining Krsna
consciousness will be easier, and we shall not be subjected to repeated
devastation. The present life is repeated birth and death, but if we seek
the path of liberation, we may be saved from repeated suffering.

TRANSLATION

Maitreya continued: O best of the Kuru dynasty, 1 shall now describe
before you the descendants of Svayambhuva Manu, who was born of the
part of the plenary expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

PURPORT

Lord Brahma is a powerful expansion of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Although Brahma is jiva-tattva, he is empowered by the Lord,
and therefore He is considered a plenary expansion of the Supreme God-
head. Sometimes it happens that when there is no suitable living being to
be empowered to act as Brahma, the Supreme Lord Himself appears as
Brahma. Brahma is the plenary expansion of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, and Svayambhuva Manu was the direct son of Brahma. The great
sage Maitreya was now going to explain about the descendants of this
Manu, all of whom are widely celebrated for their pious activities. Before
speaking of these pious descendants, Maitreya had already described the
descendants of impious activities, representing anger, envy, unpalatable
speech, quarrel, fearfulness and death. Purposely, therefore, he is next
relating the history of the life of Dhruva Maharaja, the most pious king
within this universe.

TRANSLATION
Svayambhuva Manu had two sons by his wife Satariipa, and the names
of the sons were Uttanapada and Priyavrata. Because both of them were
descendants of the plenary expansion of Vasudeva, the Supreme Person-
ality of Godhead, they were very competent to rule the universe to
maintain and protect the citizens.
PURPORT
It is said that these two kings, Uttanapada and Priyavrata, were
specifically empowered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, unlike
the great King Rsabha, who is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Him-
self.

TRANSLATION
King Uttanapada had two queens, named Suniti and Suruci. Suruci was
much more dear to the King; Suniti, who had a son named Dhruva, was not
his favorite.
PURPORT
The great sage Maitreya wanted to describe the pious activities of the
kings. Priyavrata was the first son of Svayambhuva Manu, and Uttanapada


--- Page 280 ---
286 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 8
was the second, but the great sage Maitreya immediately began to speak of
Dhruva Maharaja, the son of Uttanapada, because he was very eager to
describe pious activities. The incidents in the life of Dhruva Maharaja are
very attractive for devotees. From his pious actions, one can learn how one
can detach himself from material possessions and how one can enhance
one’s devotional service by severe austerities and penances. By hearing the
activities of pious Dhruva, one can enhance one’s faith in God and can
directly connect with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thus one
can very soon be elevated to the transcendental platform of devotional
service. The example of Dhruva Maharaja’s austerities can immediately
generate a feeling of devotional service in the hearts of the hearers.

TRANSLATION
While the child, Dhruva Maharaja, was trying to get on the lap of his
father, Suruci, his stepmother, became very envious of the child, and with
great pride she began to speak so as to be heard by the King himself.
PURPORT
The King was, of course, equally affectionate toward both his sons,
Uttama and Dhruva, so he had a natural inclination to take Dhruva as well
as Uttama on his lap. But because of his favoritism towards his Queen
Suruci, he could not welcome Dhruva Maharaja, despite his feelings. King
Uttanapada’s feeling was understood by Suruci, and therefore with great
pride she began to speak about the King’s affection for her. This is the
nature of woman. If a woman understands that her husband regards her as
a favorite and is especially affectionate to her, she takes undue advantage.
These symptoms are even visible in such an elevated society as the family
of Svayambhuva Manu. Therefore it is concluded that the feminine nature
of woman is present everywhere.

TRANSLATION
Queen Suruci told Dhruva Maharaja: My dear child, you do not deserve
to sit on the throne or on the lap of the King. Surely you are also the son

288 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 8
of the King, but because you did not take your birth in my womb, you are
not qualified to sit on your father’s lap.
PURPORT
Queen Suruci very proudly informed Dhruva Maharaja that to be the
King’s son was not the qualification for sitting on the lap or on the throne
of the King. Rather, this privilege was dependent on one’s taking birth in
the womb of Queen Suruci. In other words, she indirectly informed
Dhruva Maharajathat although he happened to be born of the King, he was
nevertheless considered to be an illegitimate son because of his birth in the
womb of the other queen.

My dear child, you are unaware that you were not born of my womb but

impossible to be fulfilled.
PURPORT
The small child, Dhruva Maharaja, was naturally affectionate toward his
father, and he did not know that there was a distinction between his two
mothers. This distinction was pointed out by Queen Suruci, who informed


--- Page 283 ---

him that since he was a child he did not understand the distinction between
the two queens. This is another statement of Queen Suruci’s pride.

because of such worship, you shall have to take your next birth in my
womb.
PURPORT
Suruci was so envious of Dhruva Maharaja that she indirectly asked him
to change his body. According to her, first of all he had to die, then take
his next body in her womb, and only then would it be possible for Dhruva
Maharaja to ascend the throne of his father.

he immediately left the palace and went to his mother.

mother. Without further delay, you must engage yourself in worshiping
the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

PURPORT
The harsh words used by Suruci to her stepson were true because unless
one is favored by the Supreme Personality of Godhead one cannot achieve
any success in life. Man proposes, God disposes. Suniti, the mother of
Dhruva Maharaja, agreed with her co-wife’s advice that Dhruva engage him-
self in the worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Indirectly the
words of Suruci were a benediction for Dhruva Maharaja, for because of the
influence of the words of his stepmother, he became a great devotee.

Suniti continued: The Supreme Personality of Godhead is so great that
simply by worshiping His lotus feet, your great-grandfather Lord Brahma
acquired the necessary qualifications to create this universe. Although he
is unborn and is the chief of all living creatures, he was situated in that
exalted post because of the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
whom even great yogis worship by controlling the mind and regulating the
life air [prana].

PURPORT
Suniti cited the example of Lord Brahma, who was Dhruva Maharaja’s
great-grandfather. Although Lord Brahma is also a living being, by his
penance and austerity he acquired the exalted position of creator of this
universe by the mercy of the Supreme Lord. To become successful in any
attempt, one not only has to undergo severe penances and austerities,
but also must be dependent on the mercy of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. This indication had been given to Dhruva Maharaja by his
stepmother and was now confirmed by his own mother, Suniti.

Suniti informed her son: Your grandfather, Svayambhuva Manu,
executed great sacrifices with distribution of charity, and thereby, with
unflinching faith and devotion, he worshiped and satisfied the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. By acting in thal way he achieved the greatest
success in material happiness and afterwards achieved liberation, which is
impossible to obtain by worshiping the demigods.


--- Page 290 ---
296 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 8
PURPORT
The success of one’s life is measured by one’s material happiness in this
life and liberation in the next. Such success can be achieved only by the
grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The words eka-matya mean
concentrating one’s mind on the Lord without deviation. This process of
undeviating worship of the Supreme Lord is also expressed in Bhagavad-gita
as ananyae-bhak. “That which is impossible to obtain from any other
source” is also mentioned here. “Other source” refers to worship of
the demigods. It is especially stressed here that the opulence of Manu
was due to his undeviating faithfulness in the transcendental service
of the Lord. One who diverts his mind to worshiping many demigods
to obtain material happiness is considered to be bereft of intelligence.
If anyone wants even material happiness, he can worship the Supreme
Lord without deviation, and persons who are desirous of liberation can
also worship the Supreme Lord and achieve their goal of life.

TRANSLATION

My dear boy, you also should take shelter of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, who is very kind to His devotees. Persons who are seeking
liberation from the cycle of birth and death always take shelter of the
lotus feet of the Lord in devotional service. Becoming purified by exe-
cuting your allotted occupation, just situate the Supreme Personality of
Godhead in your heart, and without deviating for a moment, engage
always in His service.

PURPORT

The system of bhakti-yoga described by Queen Suniti to her son is the
standard way of God realization. Everyone can continue in his constitu-
tional occupational duties and at the same time keep the Supreme Person-
ality of Godhead within his heart. This was also instructed by the Lord
Himself to Arjuna in Bhagavad-gita: ‘Go on fighting, but keep Me within
your mind.” That should be the motto of every honest person seeking
perfection in Krsna consciousness. In this connection, Queen Suniti
advised her son that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is known as
bhrtya-vatsala, which indicates that He is very kind to His devotees. She
said, “You came to me crying, having been insulted by your stepmother,
but I am unable to do any good for you. But Krsna is so kind to His
devotees that if you go to Him, then the combined kindness of millions of
mothers like me would be surpassed by His affectionate and tender deal-
ings. When everyone else fails to mitigate one’s misery, Krsna is able to
help the devotee.” Queen Suniti also stressed that the process of approach-
ing the Supreme Personality of Godhead is not easy, but is sought after by
great sages who are very advanced in spiritual realization. Queen Suniti also
indicated by her instruction that Dhruva Maharaja was only a small child,
five years old, and it was not possible for him to purify himself by the
way of karma-kanda. But by the process of bhakti-yoga, even a child less
than five years old, or anyone of any age, can be purified. That is the
special significance of bhakti-yoga. Therefore she advised him not to
accept worship of the demigods or any other process, but simply to take
to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the result would be all per-
fection. As soon as one places the Supreme Personality of Godhead within
one’s heart, everything becomes easy and successful.

TRANSLATION
My dear Dhruva, as far as 1 am concerned, 1 do not find anyone who can
mitigate your distressed condition but the Supreme Personality of God-
head, whose eyes are like lotus petals. Many demigods such as Lord
Brahma and others seek the pleasure of the goddess of fortune, but the
goddess of fortune herself, with a lotus flower in her hand, is always ready
to render service to the Supreme Lord.
PURPORT
Suniti pointed out herewith that the benediction received from the
Supreme Personality of Godhead and that received from the demigods
are not on an equal level. Foolish persons say that no matter whom one
worships one will get the same result, but actually that is not a fact.
In Bhagavad-gita it is also said that benedictions received from the


--- Page 293 ---
Text 23 Dhruva Maharaja Leaves Home for the Forest 299
demigods are all temporary and are meant for the less intelligent. In
other words, because the demigods are all materialistically conditioned
souls, although they are situated in very exalted positions, their bene-
dictions cannot be permanent. Permanent benediction is spiritual bene-
diction, since a spirit soul is elernal. It is also said in Bhagavad-gita that
only persons who have lost their intelligence go to worship the demigods.
Therefore Suniti told her son that he should not seek the mercy of
the demigods, but should directly approach the Supreme Personality of
Godhead to mitigate his misery.

Material opulences are controlled by the Supreme Personality of God-
head through His different potencies and specifically the goddess of for-
tune. Therefore, those who are after material opulences seek the pleasure
or mercy of the goddess of fortune. Even the highly placed demigods
worship the goddess of fortune, but the goddess of fortune, Maha-Laksmi
herself, is always seeking the pleasure of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Anyone, therefore, who takes to the worship of the Supreme
Lord automatically receives the blessings of the goddess of fortune. At
this stage of his life, Dhruva Maharaja was seeking material opulences, and
his mother advised rightly that even for material opulences it is better to
worship not the demigods but the Supreme Lord.

Although a pure devotee does not seek benedictions from the Supreme
Lord for material advancement, still it is stated in Bhagavad-gita that
pious persons go lo the Lord even for material benedictions. A person
who goes to the Supreme Personality of Godhead for material gain is
gradually purified in association with the Supreme Lord. Thus he becomes
free from all material desires and is elevated to the platform of spiritual
life. Unless one is raised to the spiritual platform it is not possible for
him to completely transcend all material contamination.

Suniti, the mother of ‘Dhruva, was a farseeing woman, and therefore
she advised her son to worship the Supreme Lord and no one else.
The Lord is described herein as lotus-eyed (padma-palasa-locanat). When
a person is fatigued, if he sees a lotus flower all his fatigue can be
immediately reduced to nil. Similarly, when an aggrieved person sees
the lotus face of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, immediately all
his grief is reduced. A lotus flower is also an insignia in the hands of
Lord Visnu as well as in the hand of the goddess of fortune. The
worshipers of the goddess of fortune and Lord Visnu together certainly
are very opulent in all respects, even in material life. The Lord is some-
times described as Siva-viriiici-nutam, which means that Lord Siva and


--- Page 294 ---

Lord Brahma also offer their respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana.

The great sage Maitreya continued: The instruction of Dhruva Maharaja’s
mother, Suniti, was actually meant for fulfilling his desired objective.
Therefore, after deliberate consideration and with intelligence and fixed
determination, he left his father’s house.

PURPORT

Both the mother and the son were lamenting Dhruva Maharaja’s being
insulted by his stepmother and his father’s not having taken any step on
this issue. But mere lamentation is useless—one should find out the means
to mitigate one’s lamentation. Thus both the mother and the son decided
to take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord because that is the only
solution to all material problems. It is indicated in this connection


--- Page 295 ---
Text 25] Dhruva Maharaja Leaves Home for the Forest 301
that Dhruva Maharaja left his father’s capital city to go to a secluded
place to search out the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is the
instruction of Prahlada Maharaja also that if one is seeking peace of mind
he should free himself from all contamination of family life and take
shelter of the Supreme Godhead by going to the forest. To the Gaudiya
Vaignava this forest is the forest of Vrnda, or Vrndavana. If one takes
shelter of Vrndavana under Vrndavanevari, Srimati Radharani, certainly
all the problems of his life are solved very easily.

The great sage Narada overheard this news, and understanding all the

Dhruva, and touching his head with his all-virtuous hand, he spoke as
follows.

PURPORT

When Dhruva Maharaja was talking with his mother, Suniti, of all the

incidences that had taken place in the palace, Narada was not present.


--- Page 296 ---
302 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 8
Thus the question may be raised how Narada overheard all these topics.
The answer is that Narada is tri-kala-jiia; he is so powerful that he can
understand the past, future and present of everyone’s heart, just like the
Supersoul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore, after under-
standing the strong determination of Dhruva Maharaja, he came to help
him. It may be explained in this way: The Supreme Personality of God-
head is present in everyone’s heart, and as soon as He understands that a
living entity is serious about entering devotional service, he sends His
representative. In this way Narada was sent to Dhruva Maharaja. This is
explained in the Caitanya-caritamrta: guru-krsna-prasade paya bhakti-lata
bija: By the grace of the spiritual master and Krsna, one can enter into
devotional service. Because of Dhruva Maharaja’s determination, Krsna,
the Supersoul, immediately sent His representative, Narada, to initiate
him.

from battle. It appears that the ksatriya blood within the body of Dhruva
Maharaja was naturally very active. If the brahminical, ksatriya or vaisya
culture is maintained in a family, naturally the sons and grandsons inherit
the spirit of the particular class. Therefore, according to the Vedic system,
the sariiskara, or the reformatory system, is maintained very rigidly. If one
fails to observe the reformatory measures current in the family, then
immediately he is degraded to a lower standard of life.

TRANSLATION

The great sage Narada told Dhruva: My dear boy, you are only a little
boy whose attachment is to sports and other frivolities. Why are you so
affected by words insulting your honor?

PURPORT

Ordinarily if a child is rebuked as a rascal or fool, he smiles and does not
take such insulting words very seriously. Similarly, if words of honor are
offered, he does not appreciate them. But in the case of Dhruva Maharaja,
the ksatriya spirit was so strong that he could not tolerate a slight insult
from his stepmother which injured his ksatriya prestige.

TRANSLATION
My dear Dhruva, if you feel that your sense of honor has been insulted,
you still have no cause for dissatisfaction. This kind of dissatisfaction is
another feature of the illusory energy because every living entity is con-
trolled by his previous actions, and therefore there are different varieties
of life for enjoying or suffering.
PURPORT
In the Vedas it is said that the living entity is always uncontaminated
and unaffected by material association. The living entity gets different
types of material bodies because of his previous fruitive actions. If, how-
ever, one understands the philosophy that as a living spirit soul he has an
affinity for neither suffering nor enjoyment, then he is considered to be a
liberated person. It is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita, brahma-bhiitah
prasannatma: When one is actually situated on the transcendental platform,
he has nothing for which to lament and nothing for which to hanker
(Bg. 18.54). Narada Rsi first of all wanted to impress upon Dhruva
Maharaja that he was only a child; he should not have been affected by
words of insult or honor. And if he were so developed as to understand
honor and insult, then this understanding should have been applied in his
own life; he should have known that honor and dishonor are both destined
only by one’s previous actions; therefore one should not be sorry or
happy under any circumstances.

TRANSLATION
The process of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is very wonderful.
One who is intelligent should accept that process and be satisfied with
whatever comes, favorable or unfavorable, by His supreme will.
PURPORT
The great sage Narada instructed Dhruva Maharaja that one should be
satisfied in all circumstances. Everyone who is intelligent should know
that because of our concept of bodily existence, we are subjected to
suffering and enjoyment. One who is in the transcendental position,
beyond the concept of bodily life, is considered to be intelligent. One who
is a devotee especially accepts all reverses as gifts of the Supreme Lord.
When a devotee is put into distress, he accepts this as God’s mercy and
offers Him repeated obeisances with his body, mind and intellect. An
intelligent person, therefore, should be always satisfied, depending on the
mercy of the Lord.

Now you have decided to undertake the mystic process of meditation

man. It is very difficult to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
PURPORT
The process of bhakti-yoga is simultaneously very difficult and very
easy to perform. Sri Narada Muni, the supreme spiritual master, is testing
Dhruva Maharaja to see how determined he is to prosecute devotional
service. This is the process of accepting a disciple. The great sage Narada
Muni has come to Dhruva under the direction of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead just to initiate him, yet he is testing his determination to
execute the process. It is a fact, however, that for a sincere person devo-
tional service is very easy. But for one who is not determined and sincere,
this process is very difficult.

For this reason, my dear boy, you should not endeavor for this; it will
not be successful. It is better that you go home. When you are grown up,
by the mercy of the Lord you will get a chance for these mystic perfor-
mances. At that time you may execute this function.
PURPORT
Generally, a thoroughly trained person takes to spiritual perfection at
the end of his life. According to the Vedic system, therefore, life is divided
into four stages. In the beginning, one becomes a brahmacari, a student
who studies Vedic knowledge under the authoritative guidance of a spiri-
tual master. He then becomes a householder and executes household duties
according to the Vedic process. Then the householder becomes a vana-
prastha, and gradually, when he is mature, he renounces household life


--- Page 302 ---
308 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 8
and vanaprastha life also and takes to sannyisa, completely devoting him-
self to devotional service.

Generally, people think that childhood is meant for enjoying life by
engaging oneself in sports and play, youth is meant for enjoying the
company of young girls, and when one becomes old, at the time of death,
then he may try to execute devotional service or a mystic yoga process. But
this conclusion is not for devotees who are actually serious. The great
sage Narada Muni is instructing Dhruva Maharaja just to test him.
Actually, the direct order is that from any point of life one should begin
rendering devotional service. But it is the duty of the spiritual master to
test the disciple to see how seriously he desires to execute devotional
service. Then he may be initiated.

TRANSLATION

One should try to keep himself satisfied in any condition of life—
whether distress or happiness—which is offered by the supreme will. A
person who endures in this way is able to cross over the darkness of
nescience very easily.

PURPORT

Material existence consists of pious and impious fruitive activities. As
long as one is engaged in any kind of activity other than devotional service,
it will result in the happiness and distress of this material world. When we


--- Page 303 ---
Text 34] Dhruva Maharaja Leaves Home for the Forest 309
enjoy life in so-called material happiness, it is to be understood that we are
diminishing the resultant actions of our pious activities. And when we are
put into suffering, it is to be understood that we are diminishing the
resultant action of our impious activities. Instead of being attached to the
circumstantial happiness and distress resulting from pious or impious
activities, if we want to get out of the clutches of this nescience, then
whatever position we are put in by the will of the Lord we should accept.
Thus if we simply surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we
get out of the clutches of this material existence.

Every man should act like this: when he meets a person more qualified
than himself, he should be very pleased; when he meets someone less
qualified than himself, he should be compassionate toward him; and when
he meets someone equal to himself, he should make friendship with him.
In this way one is never affected by the threefold miseries of this material
world.

PURPORT

Generally when we find someone more qualified than ourselves, we
become envious of him; when we find someone less qualified, we deride
him; and when we find someone equal we become very proud of our


--- Page 304 ---
310 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 8
activities. These are the causes of all material tribulations. The great sage
Narada therefore advised that a devotee should act perfectly. Instead of
being envious of a more qualified man, one should be jolly to receive him.
Instead of being oppressive to a less qualified man, one should be compas-
sionate toward him just to raise him to the proper standard. And when one
meets an equal, instead of being proud of one’s own activities before him,
one should treat him as a friend. One should also have compassion for the
people in general, who are suffering due to forgetfulness of Krsna. These
important functions will make one happy within this material world.

Dhruva Maharaja said: My dear Lord Naradaji, for a person whose heart
is disturbed by the material conditions of happiness and distress, whatever
you have so kindly explained for attainment of peace of mind is certainly
a very good instruction. But as far as I am concerned, I am covered by
ignorance, and this kind of philosophy does not touch my heart.
PURPORT
There are various classes of men. One class is called akarmis, referring to
those who have no material desire. Desire must exist, either material or


--- Page 305 ---
Text 36] Dhruva Maharaja Leaves Home for the Forest 311
spiritual. Material desire arises when one wants to satisfy one’s personal
senses. One who is ready to sacrifice anything to satisfy the Supreme
Personality of Godhead can be said to have spiritual desire. Dhruva did not
accept the instruction given by the great saint Narada because he thought
himself unfit for such instruction, which prohibited all material desires. It
is not a fact, however, that those who have material desires are prohibited
from worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the essen-
tial instruction from the life of Dhruva. He frankly admitted that his
heart was full of material desires. First of all, he was very much affected
by the cruel words of his stepmother, whereas those who are spiritually
advanced do not care about anyone’s condemnation or adoration.

In Bhagavad-gita it is said that persons who are actually advanced in
spiritual life do not care for the dual behavior of this material world. But
Dhruva Maharaja frankly admitted that he was not beyond the affliction
of material distress and happiness. He was confident that the instruction
given by Narada was valuable, yet he could not accept it. The question
raised here is whether or not a person afflicted by material desires is fit to
worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The answer is that everyone
is fit to worship Him. Even if one has many material desires to fulfill, he
should take to Krsna consciousness and worship the Supreme Lord Krsna,
who is so merciful that He fulfills everyone’s desires. Through this narration
it will become very clear that no one is barred from worshiping the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, even if he has many material desires.

TRANSLATION

My dear lord, I am very impudent for not accepting your instructions,
but this is not my fault. It is due to my being born in a ksatriya family. My
stepmother, Suruci, has pierced my heart with her harsh words. Therefore
your valuable instruction does not stand in my heart.

PURPORT

It is said that the heart or mind is just like an earthen pot; once broken,
it cannot be repaired by any means. Dhruva Maharaja gave this example to
Narada Muni. He said that his heart, having been pierced by the arrows of
his stepmother’s harsh words, felt so broken that nothing seemed valuable
but his desire to counteract her insult. His stepmother had said that be-
cause he was born in the womb of Suniti, a neglected queen of Maharaja
Uttanapada, Dhruva Maharaja was not fit to sit either on the throne or on
his father’s lap. In other words, according to his stepmother, he could not
be declared king. Dhruva Maharaja’s determination was to become king of
a planet exalted even beyond that possessed by Lord Brahma, the greatest
of all the demigods.

Dhruva Maharaja indirectly informed the great sage Narada that there
are four kinds of human spirit—the brahminical spirit, the ksatriya spirit,
the vaisya spirit and the siidra spirit. The spirit of one caste is not applicable
to the members of another. The philosophical spirit enunciated by Narada
Muni might have been suitable for a brahmana spirit, but it was not suitable
for a ksatriya. Dhruva frankly admitted that he was lacking in brahminical
humility and was therefore unable to accept the philosophy of Narada
Muni.

The statements of Dhruva Maharaja indicate that unless a child is
trained according to his tendency, there is no possibility of his develop-
ing his particular spirit. It was the duty of the spiritual master or teacher
to observe the psychological movement of a particular boy and thus train
him in a particular occupational duty. Dhruva Maharaja, having already
been trained in the ksatriya spirit, would not accept the brahminical
philosophy. We have practical experience of this incompatibility of the
brahminical and ksatriya temperaments in America. The American boys,
who have simply been trained as Siidras, are not at all fit to fight in battle.
Therefore, when they are called to join the military, they refuse because
they do not have ksatriya spirit. This is a cause of great dissatisfaction in
society.

That the boys do not have the ksatriya spirit does not mean that they are


--- Page 307 ---
Text 37] Dhruva Maharaja Leaves Home for the Forest 313
trained in brahminical qualities; they are trained as $idras, and thus in
frustration they are becoming hippies. However, as soon as they enter the
Krsna consciousness movement which is being started in America, they
are trained to meet the brahminical qualifications, even though they have
fallen to the lowest conditions as $idras. In other words, since the Krsna
consciousness movement is open for everyone, people in general can attain
the brahminical qualifications. This is the greatest need at the present
moment, for now there are actually no brdhmanas or ksatriyas but only
some vai$yas and, for the most part, sidras. The classification of society in-
to brahmanas, ksatriyas, vaisyas and इद काऽ is very scientific. In the human
social body, the brahmanas are considered the head, the ksatriyas are the
arms, the vaisyas are the belly, and the $iidras are the legs. At the present
moment the body has legs and a belly, but there are no arms or head, and
therefore society is topsy-turvy. It is necessary to reestablish the brahmini-
cal qualifications in order to raise the fallen human society to the highest
standard of spiritual consciousness.

--- Page 308 ---
314 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 8
PURPORT

When Dhruva Maharaja refused to accept the brahminical instruction of
Narada Muni, naturally the next question would be what sort of instruction
he wanted. So, even before Narada Muni asked, Dhruva Maharaja expressed
his heartfelt desire. His father, of course, was the emperor of the entire
world, and his grandfather, Lord Brahma, was the creator of the universe.
Dhruva Maharaja expressed his desire to possess a kingdom better than
those of his father and grandfather. He frankly stated that he wanted a
kingdom which had no competitor within the three worlds, namely the
higher, middle and lower planetary systems. The greatest personality within
this universe is Lord Brahma, and Dhruva Maharaja wanted a position even
greater than his. lle wanted to take advantage of Narada Muni’s presence
because he knew very well that if Narada Muni, the greatest devotee of
Lord Krsna, could bless him or show him the path, then certainly he would
be able to occupy a more exalted position than any person within the
three worlds. Thus he wanted help from Naradaji to achieve that position.
Dhruva Maharaja wanted a position greater than that of Brahma. This was
practically an impossible proposition, but by pleasing the Supreme Person-
ality of Godhead a devotee can achieve even the impossible.

One particular point mentioned here is that Dhruva Maharaja wanted to
occupy an exalted position not by hoolor by crook, but by honest means.
This indicates that if Krsna offered him such a position, then he would
accept it. That is the nature of a devotee. He may desire material gain, but
he accepts it only if Krsna offers it. Dhruva Maharaja was sorry to refuse
the instruction of Narada Muni; therefore he requested him to be merciful
to him by showing a path by which he could fulfill his mind’s desires.

My dear lord, you are a worthy son of Lord Brahma, and you travel,
playing on your musical instrument, the vina, for the welfare of the entire
universe. You are like the sun, which rotates in the universe for the benefit
of all living beings.

PURPORT

Dhruva Maharaja, although a young child, expressed his hope that he
might be offered the benediction of a kingdom which would exceed in
opulence those of his father and grandfather. He also expressed his glad-
ness that he had met such an exalted person as Narada, whose only con-
cern was to illuminate the world, like the sun, which rotates all over the
universe only for the purpose of benefiting the inhabitants of all planets.
Narada Muni travels all over the universe for the sole purpose of perform-
ing the best welfare activity for the entire universe by teaching everyone
how to become a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus
Dhruva Maharaja felt fully assured that Narada Muni could fulfill his
desire, even though the desire was very extraordinary.

The example of the sun is very significant. The sun is so kind that he
distributes his sunshine everywhere, without consideration. Dhruva
Mahar3dja requested Narada Muni to be merciful to him. He pointed out
that Narada travels all over the universe just for the purpose of doing good
to all conditioned souls. He requested that Narada Muni show his mercy
by awarding him the benefit of his particular desire. He was strongly
determined to fulfill his desire, and it was for that purpose that he had left
his home and palace.

also that of a playful child. Still, the great sage became compassionate
towards him, and for his welfare he spoke the following verses.

your mother, Suniti, to follow the path of devotional service to the


--- Page 311 ---
Text 41] Dhruva Maharaja Leaves Home for the Forest 317
Supreme Personality of Godhead, is just suitable for you. You should
therefore completely absorb yourself in the devotional service of the
Lord.

PURPORT

Dhruva Maharaja’s demand was to achieve an abode even greater than
Lord Brahma’s. Within this universe, Lord Brahma is supposed to be in the
most exalted position, for he is the chief of all demigods, but Dhruva
Maharaja wanted a realm beyond his. Therefore his desire was not to be
fulfilled by worshiping any demigod. As described in Bhagavad-gita, the
benedictions offered by the demigods are all temporary. Therefore Narada
Muni asked Dhruva Maharaja to follow the path which was recommended
by his mother—to worship Krsna, Vasudeva. When Krsna offers anything,
it is beyond the expectation of the devotee. Both Suniti and Narada Muni
knew that the demand of Dhruva Maharaja was impossible for any demigod
to fulfill, and therefore both of them recommended following the process
of devotional service to Lord Krsna.

Narada Muni is referred to here as Bhagavan because he can bless any
person just as the Supreme Personality of Godhead can. He was very
pleased with Dhruva Maharaja, and he could have at once personally given
whatever he wanted, but that is not the duty of a spiritual master. His duty
is to engage the disciple in proper devotional service as prescribed in the
sastras. Krsna was similarly present before Arjuna, and even though He
could have given him all facilities for victory over the opposing party
without a fight, He did not do so; He asked him to fight. In the same way,
Narada Muni asked Dhruva Maharaja to undergo devotional discipline in
order to achieve the desired result.

TRANSLATION

Any person who desires the fruits of the four principles of religiosity,
economic development, sense gratification and, at the end, liberation,
should engage himself in the devotional service of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead because worship of His lotus feet yields the fulfillment of all
of these.

PURPORT

In Bhagavad-gita it is said that only with the sanction of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead can the demigods offer benediction. Therefore,
whenever any sacrifice is offered to a demigod, the Supreme Lord in the
form of Narayana-dila or Salagrama-éila is put forward to observe the
sacrifice. Actually, the demigods cannot give any benediction without the
sanction of the Supreme Lord. Narada Muni, therefore, advised that even
for religiosity, economic development, sense gratification or liberation, one
should approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead, offer prayers and
ask for the fulfillment of his desire at the lotus feet of the Lord. That is
real intelligence. An intelligent person never goes to demigods to pray for
anything. He goes directly to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is
the cause of all benediction.

As Lord Sri Krsna has said in Bhagavad-gita, performance of ritualistic
ceremonies is not actually religion. The real path of religion is to surrender
at the lotus feet of the Lord. For one who is actually surrendered to the
lotus feet of the Lord, there is no question of any separate endeavor
for economic development. A devotee engaged in service to the Lord is
not disappointed in the satisfaction of his senses. If he wants to satisfy
his senses, Krsna fulfills that desire. As far as liberation is concerned, any
devotee fully engaged in the service of the Lord is already liberated;
therefore there is no separate necessity for his liberation.

Narada Muni therefore advised Dhruva Maharaja to take shelter of
Vasudeva, Lord Krsna, and engage himself in the way that his mother had
advised, for that would help him fulfill his desire. In this verse Narada
Muni has especially stressed the devotional service of the Lord as the only


--- Page 313 ---
Text 42] Dhruva Maharaja Leaves Home for the Forest 319
way. In other words, even if one is full of material desires, he can continue
his devotional service to the Lord, and all his desires will be fulfilled.

TRANSLATION

My dear boy, therefore I wish all good fortune for you. You should go
to the bank of the Yamuna, where there is a virtuous forest named
Madhuvana, and there be purified. Just by going there, one draws nearer to
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who always lives there.

PURPORT

Both Narada Muni and Suniti, the mother of Dhruva Maharaja, advised
Dhruva Maharaja to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Now,
Narada Muni is especially giving him directions how this worship of the
Supreme Person can very quickly fructify. He recommends that Dhruva
Maharaja go to the bank of the Yamuna, where there is a forest by the
name Madhuvana, and begin his meditation and worship there.

Places of pilgrimage yield a special advantage for a devotee in quickly
advancing his spiritual life. Lord Krsna lives everywhere, but still it is very
easy to approach Him in holy places of pilgrimage because these places are
inhabited by great sages. Lord Sri Krsna says that He lives wherever His
devotees are chanting the glories of His transcendental activities. There are
many places of pilgrimage in India, and especially prominent are
Badrinarayana, Dvaraka, Ramesvaram and Jagannatha Puri. These sacred


--- Page 314 ---
320 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 8
places are called the four dhamas. Dhama refers to a place where one can
immediately contact the Supreme Lord. To go to Badrinarayana one has to
pass through Haridvara on the path to the Supreme Personality of God-
head. Similarly, there are other holy places of pilgrimage, such as Prayag
(Allahabad) and Mathura, and the topmost of them all is Vrndavana.
Unless one is very advanced in spiritual life, it is recommended that he live
in such holy places and execute devotional service there. But an advanced
devotee like Narada Muni who is engaged in preaching work can serve the
Supreme Lord anywhere. Sometimes he even goes to the hellish planets.
Hellish conditions do not affect Narada Muni because he is engaged in
greatly responsible activities in devotional service. According to the state-
ment of Narada Muni, Madhuvana, which is still existing in the Vrndavana
area, in the district of Mathura, is a most sacred place. Many saintly persons
still live there and engage in the devotional service of the Lord.

There are twelve forests in the area of Vrndavana, and Madhuvana is one
of them. Pilgrims from all parts of India assemble together and visit all
twelve of these forests. There are five forests on the eastern bank of the
Yamuna: Bhadravana, Bilvavana, Lauhavana, Bhandiravana and Mahavana.
On the western side of the bank there are seven: Madhuvana, Talavana,
Kumudavana, Bahulavana, Kamyavana, Khadiravana and Vrndavana. In
those twelve forests there are different ghats, or bathing places. They are
listed as follows: (1) Avimukta, (2) Adhiradha, (3) Guhyatfirtha, (4)
Prayagatirtha, (5) Kanakhala, (6) Tindukatirtha, (7) Siryatirtha, (8)
Vatasvami, (9) Dhruvaghata (Dhruvaghata, where there are many nice
fruit and flower trees, is famous because Dhruva Maharaja meditated and
underwent severe penances and austerities there in an elevated spot),
(10) Rsitirtha, (11) Moksatirtha, (12) Budhatirtha, (13) Gokarna, (14)
Krsnaganga, (15) Vaikuntha, (16) Asikunda, (17) Catuhsamudrika-kupa,
(18) Akraratirtha (When Krsna and Balarama were going to Mathura in the
chariot driven by Akrura, all of them took baths in this ghat), (19)
Yajnigviprasthana, (20) Kubja-kiipa, (21) Rargasthala, (22) Marichasthala,
(23) Manllayudhasthana, and (24) Dasasvamedha.

TRANSLATION
Narada Muni instructed: My dear boy, in the waters of the Yamuna
River, which is known as Kalindi, you should take. three baths daily
because the water is very auspicious, sacred and clear. After bathing, you
should perform the necessary regulative principles for astariga-yoga and
then sit down on your asana [sitting place] in a calm and quiet position.

PURPORT
It appears from this statement that Dhruva Maharaja had already been
instructed how to practice the eightfold yoga system, which is known as
astanga-yoga. This system is explained in our Bhagavad-gita As It Is, in the
chapter entitled “Sankhya-yoga,”” pages 319-322. It is understood that in
astanga-yoga one practices settling the mind and then concentrating it on
the form of Lord Visnu, as will be described in the following verses. It is
clearly stated here that astanga-yoga is not a bodily gymnastic exercise,
but a practice to concentrate the mind on the form of Vignu. Before sitting
on his dsana, which is also described in Bhagavad-gita, one has to cleanse
himself very nicely in clear or sacred water thrice daily. The water of
Yamuna is naturally very clear and pure, and thus if anyone bathes there
three times, undoubtedly he will be very greatly purified externally.
Narada Muni, therefore, instructed Dhruva Maharaja to go to the bank of
the Yamuna and thus become externally purified. This is part of the

gradual process of practicing mystic yoga.

TRANSLATION

After sitting on your seat, practice the three kinds of breathing
exercises, and thus gradually control the life air, the mind and the senses.
Completely free yourself from all material contamination, and with great
patience begin to meditate on the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

PURPORT

In this verse the entire yoga system is described in summary, and special
stress is given to the breathing exercise for stopping the disturbing mind.
The mind, by nature, is always oscillating, for it is very fickle, but the
breathing exercise is meant to control it. This process of controlling the
mind might have been very possible in those days millions of years ago
when Dhruva Maharaja took to it, but at the present moment the mind
has to be fixed directly on the lotus feet of the Lord by the chanting
process. By chanting the Hare Krsna mantra one immediately concentrates
on the sound vibration and thinks of the lotus feet of the Lord, and very
quickly one is elevated to the position of samadhi, or trance. 11 one goes
on chanting the holy names of the Lord, which are not different from the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, naturally his mind becomes absorbed in
thought of the Lord.

It is here recommended to Dhruva Maharaja that he meditate on the
supreme guru or supreme spiritual master. The supreme spiritual master is
Krsna, who is therefore known as caitya-guru. This refers to the Supersoul,
who is sitting in everyone’s heart. He helps, as stated in Bhagavad-gita,
from within, and He sends the spiritual master, who helps from without.
The spiritual master is the external manifestation of the caitya-guru, or the
spiritual master sitting in everyone’s heart.

The process by which we give up our thoughts of material things 15 called
pratyaha&ra, which entails being freed from all material thoughts and en-
gagements. The word abhidhydyet, which is used in this verse, indicates that
unless one’s mind is fixed, one cannot meditate. The conclusion, therefore,
is that meditation means thinking of the Lord within. Whether one comes
to that stage by the astanga-yoga system or by the method which is
recommended in the $astras especially for this present age—to constantly
chant the holy name of the lLord—the goal is to meditate on the Supreme
Personality of Godhead.

award benediction to them. His eyes, His nicely decorated eyebrows, His
raised nose and His broad forehead are all very beautiful. He is more
beautiful than all the demigods.
PURPORT
This verse clearly explains how one has to meditate on the form of the
Lord. Impersonal meditation is a bogus invention of modern days. In none
of the Vedic literatures is impersonal meditation recommended. In
Bhagavad-gita, when meditation is recommended, the word “mat-parah,”
which means “pertaining to Me,” is used. Any Visnu form pertains to
Lord Krsna because Lord Krsna is the original Visnu form. Sometimes
someone tries to meditale upon the impersonal Brahman, which is
described in Bhagavad-gila as avyakla, meaning unmanifested or impersonal.
But it is remarked by the Lord Himself that those who are attached to this
impersonal feature of the Lord suffer a very troublesome task because no
one can concentrate on the impersonal feature. One has Lo concentrate on
the form of the Lord, which is described here in connection with Dhruva
Maharaja’s meditation. As will be apparent from later descriptions, Dhruva
Maharaja perfected this kind of meditation, and his yoga was successful.

TRANSLATION

Narada Muni continued: The Lord’s form is always youthful. Every
limb and every part of His body is properly formed, free from defect.
Both His eyes and lips are pinkish like the rising sun. He is always
prepared to give shelter to the surrendered soul, and anyone who is so
fortunate as to look upon Him feels all satisfaction. The Lord is always
worthy to be the master of the surrendered soul, for He is the ocean of
mercy.

PURPORT

Everyone has to surrender to someone superior. That is always the
nature of our living condition. At the present moment we are trying to
surrender to someone—either to society, or to our nation, family, state or
government. The surrendering process already exists, but it is never perfect
because the person or institution unto whom we surrender is imperfect,
and our surrender, having so many ulterior motives, is also imperfect. As
such, in the material world no one is worthy to accept anyone’s surrender,
nor does anyone fully surrender to anyone else unless he is obliged to do
so. But here the surrendering process is voluntary, and the Lord is worthy
to accept the surrender. This surrender by the living entity occurs auto-
matically as soon as he sees the beautiful youthful nature of the Lord.

The description given by Narada Muni is not imaginary. The form of the
Lord is understood by the parampara system. Mayavadi philosophers say
that we have to imagine the form of the Lord, but here Narada Muni does


--- Page 319 ---
Text 47] Dhruva Maharaja Leaves Home for the Forest 325
not say that. Rather, he gives the description of the Lord from authorita-
tive sources. He is himself an authority, and he is able to go to Vaikuntha-
loka and see the Lord personally; therefore his description of the bodily
features of the Lord is not imagination. Sometimes we give instructions to
our students about the bodily features of the Lord, and they paint Him.
Their paintings are not imaginary. The description is given through
disciplic succession, just like that given by Narada Muni, who sees the
Lord and describes His bodily features. Therefore, such descriptions should
be accepted, and if they are painted, that is not imaginative painting.

manifest with four hands, which hold [ beginning from the lower left hand]
a conchshell, wheel, club and lotus flower.
PURPORT
Here in this verse the word purusam is very significant. The Lord is
never female. He is always male (purusa). Therefore the impersonalist who
imagines the Lord’s form as that of a woman is mistaken. The Lord appears
in female form if necessary, but His perpetual form is purusa because He is
originally male. The feminine feature of the Lord is displayed by goddesses
of fortune—Lakgmi, Radharani, Sita, etc. All these goddesses of fortune
are servitors of the Lord; they are not the Supreme, as falsely imagined by
the impersonalist. Lord Krgna in His Narayana feature is always four-

handed. On the Battlefield of Kuruksetra, when Arjuna wanted to see His
universal form, He showed this feature of four-handed Narayana. Some
devotees are of the opinion that Krsna is an incarnation of Narayana, but
the Bhagavata school says that Narayana is a manifestation of Krsna.

The word niyatena is very significant in this connection, for it indicates
that one should execute the meditation practice as stated above. One

By this prescribed method one can practice concentration upon the Lord
until he is so fixed that he remains in trance, thinking always of the form
of the Lord. The word used here 15 ekabhiitena, which means (८ with great
attention and concentration.” If one concentrates on the descriptions of
the bodily features of the Lord, he will never fall down. <

PURPORT
This fixed meditation is called samadhi, or trance. A person constantly
engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord cannot be deviated
from meditating on the form of the Lord, as described herein. The arcana-
marga, or the devotional path prescribed in the paiicaratra system of
devotional service for worshiping the Deity in the temple, makes the
devotee think constantly of the Lord; that is samadhi, or trance. One who
practices in this way cannot deviate from the service of the Lord, and that
makes him perfect in the mission of human life.

O son of the King, now I shall speak unto you the mantra which is to be

for seven nights can see the perfect human beings flying in the sky.
PURPORT
Within this universe there is a planet called Siddhaloka. The inhabitants
of Siddhaloka are by nature perfect in the yoga achievements, which are
of eight varieties: one can become smaller than the smallest, lighter than
the lightest, or bigger than the biggest, one can immediately get whatever
he likes, one can even create a planet, etc. These are some of the yogic
perfections. By virtue of the laghima-siddhi, or purificatory process to
become lighter than the lightest, the inhabitants of Siddhaloka can fly in
the sky without airplanes or airships. It is hinted herein by Narada Muni to
Dhruva Maharaja that by meditating upon the transcendental form of the


--- Page 324 ---
330 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 8
Lord and at the same time chanting the mantra one becomes so perfect
within seven days that he can see the human beings who fly in the sky.
Narada Muni used the word japah, which indicates that the mantra to be
chanted is very confidential. One may ask, “If it is confidential, why is it
mentioned in the writing of Srimad-Bhagavatam?” 1t is confidential in this
sense: one may receive a published mantra anywhere, but unless it is
accepted through the chain of disciplic succession, the mantra does not act.
It is said by authoritative sources that any mantra chanted without having
been received from the disciplic succession has no efficacy.

Another point established in this verse is that meditation should be
carried on with the chanting of a mantra. Chanting of the Hare Krsna
mantra is the easiest process of meditation in this age. As soon as one
chants the Hare Krsna mantra, he sees the forms of Krsna, Rama and
Their energies, and that is the perfect stage of trance. One should not arti-
ficially try to see the form of the Lord while chanting Hare Krsna, but
when the chanting is performed offenselessly the Lord will automatically
reveal Himself to the view of the chanter. The chanter, therefore, has to
concentrate on hearing the vibration, and without extra endeavor on his
part, the Lord will automatically appear.

tion of place, time and attendant conveniences and inconveniences.

PURPORT

07) namo bhagavate vasudevaya is known as the Dvadasaksara-mantra.
This mantra is chanted by Vaignava devotees, and it begins with pranava,
or orikdra. There is an injunction that those who are not brihmanas
cannot pronounce the pranava mantra. But Dhruva Maharaja was born a
ksatriya. He at once admitted before Narada Muni that as a ksatriya he
was unable to accept his instruction of renunciation and mental
equilibrium, which are the concern of a brahmana. Still, although not a
brahmana but a ksatriya, Dhruva was allowed, on the authority of Narada,
to pronounce the pranava orkara. This is very significant. Especially in
India, the caste brahmanas object greatly when persons from other castes,
who are not born in brahmana families, recite this pranava mantra. But
here is tacit proof that if a person accepts the Vaisnava mantra or
Vaisnava way of worshiping the Deity, he is allowed to chant the
pranava mantra. In Bhagavad-gita the Lord personally accepts that anyone,
even one of a low species, can be elevated to the highest position and go
back home, back to Godhead, simply if he worships properly.

The prescribed rules, as stated here by Narada Muni, are that one
should accept the mantra through a bona fide spiritual master and hear
the mantra in the right ear. Not only should one chant or murmur the
mantra, but in front of him he must have the Deity or physical form of
the Lord. Of course, when the Lord appears it is no longer a physical
form. For example, when an iron rod is made red-hot in a fire, it is no
longer iron; it is fire. Similarly, when we make a form of the Lord—
whether of wood, or stone, or metal, or jewel, or paint, or even a form
within the mind—it is a bona fide, spiritual, transcendental form of the
Lord. One must not only receive the mantra from the bona fide spiritual
master like Narada Muni or his representative in the disciplic succession,
but one must chant the mantra. And not only must one chant, but he
should also offer whatever foodstuff is available in his part of the world,
according to time and convenience.


--- Page 326 ---
332 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 8

The method of worship—chanting the mantra and preparing the forms
of the Lord—is not stereotyped, nor is it exactly the same everywhere.
It is specifically mentioned in this verse that one should take consideration
of the time, place and available conveniences. Our Krsna consciousness
movement is going on throughout the entire world, and we also install
Deities in different centers. Sometimes our Indian friends, puffed up with
concocted notions, criticize, “This has not been done. That has not been
done.” But they forget this instruction of Narada Muni to one of the
greatest Vaignavas, Dhruva Maharaja. One has to consider the particular
time, country and conveniences. What is convenient in India may not be
convenient in the Western countries. Those who are not actually in the
line of dcaryas, or who personally have no knowledge how to act in the
role of dacarya, unnecessarily criticize the activities of the ISKCON
movement in countries outside of India. The fact is that such critics
cannot do anything personally to spread Krsna consciousness. If someone
does go and preach, taking all risks and allowing all considerations for
time and place, it might be that there are changes in the manner of worship,
but that is not at all faulty according to $astra. Sriman Viraraghavacarya,
an dcdarya in the disciplic succession of the Ramanuja Sampradaya, has
remarked in his commentary that candalas, or conditioned-souls who are
born in lower than sidra families, can also be initiated according to
circumstances. The formalities may be slightly changed here and there to
make them Vaignavas.

Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu recommends that His name should be
heard in every nook and corner of the world. How is this possible unless
one preaches everywhere? The cult of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu is
Bhagavata-dharma, and He especially recommends Krsna-katha, or the
cult of Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam. He recommends that every
Indian, considering this task as paropakara, or welfare activity, take the
Lord’s message to other residents of the world. “Other residents of the
world” does not refer only to those who are exactly like the Indian
brahmanas or ksatriyas, or like the caste brahmanas, who claim to be
brahmapas because they were born in the families of brahmanas. The
principle that only Indians and Hindus should be brought into the
Vaignava cult is a mistaken idea. There should be propaganda to bring
everyone to the Vaisnava cult. The Krsna consciousness movement is
meant for this purpose. There is no bar to propagating the Krsna
consciousness movement even among people who are born in capdila,
mleccha or yavana families. Even in India, this point has been enunciated
by Srila Sanatana Gosviami in his book Hari-bhakti-vilasa, which is smrti


--- Page 327 ---
Text 55] Dhruva Maharaja Leaves Home for the Forest 333
and is the authorized Vedic guide for Vaisnavas in their daily behavior.
Sanatana Gosvami says that as bell metal can turn to gold when mixed
with mercury in a chemical process, so, by the bona fide diksa or initiation
method, anyone can become a Vaisnava. One should take initiation from a
bona fide spiritual master coming in the disciplic succession who is
authorized by his predecessor spiritual master. This is called diksa-vidhana.
Lord Krsna states in Bhagavad-gita, vyapasritya: one should accept a
spiritual master. By this process the entire world can be converted to
Krsna consciousness.

TRANSLATION

One should worship the Lord by offering pure water, pure flower
garlands, fruits, flowers and vegetables, which are available in the forest,
or by collecting newly grown grasses, small buds of flowers or even the
skins of trees, and if possible, by offering tulasi leaves, which are very
dear to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

PURPORT

It is specifically mentioned herein that tulasi leaves are very dear to the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, and devotees should take particular
care to have tulasi leaves in every temple and center of worship. In the
Western countries, while engaged in propagating the Krsna consciousness
movement, we were brought great unhappiness because we could not
find tulasi leaves. We are very much obliged, therefore, to our disciple


--- Page 328 ---
334 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 8
Srimati Govinda dasi because she has taken much care to grow tulast
plants from seeds, and she has been successful by the grace of Krsna.
Now tulast plants are growing in almost every center of our movement.
Tulasi leaves are very important in the method of worshiping the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this verse the word salilaih means
“by the water.” Of course, Dhruva Maharaja was worshiping on the bank
of the Yamuna. The Yamuna and the Ganges are sacred, and sometimes
devotees in India insist that the Deity must be worshiped with water of
the Ganges or Yamuna. But here we understand desa-kdla to mean
“according to time and country.” In the Western countries there is no
River Yamuna or Ganges—water from such sacred rivers is not available.
Does this mean that the arca worship should be stopped for that reason?
No. Salilaih refers to any water—whatever is available—but it must be
very clear and collected purely. That water can be used. The other
paraphernalia, such as flower garlands, fruits and vegetables, should be
collected according to the country and according to their availability.
Tulasi leaves are very important for satisfying the Lord, so as far as
possible, an arrangement should be made for growing tulasi leaves.
Dhruva Maharaja was advised to worship the Lord with the fruits and
flowers available in the forest. In the Bhagavad-gita Krsna frankly says
that He accepts vegetables, fruits, flowers, etc. One should not offer
Lord Vasudeva anything other than what is prescribed herein by the
great authority Narada Muni. One cannot offer to the Deity according
to one’s whims, but since these fruits and vegetables are available any-
where in the universe, we should observe this small point very attentively.

Text 57] Dhruva Maharaja Leaves Home for the Forest 335
TRANSLATION

It is possible to worship a form of the Lord made of physical elements
such as earth, water, pulp, wood and metal. In the forest one can make a
form with no more than earth and water and worship Him according to
the above principles. A devotee who has full control over his self should
be very sober and peaceful and must be satisfied simply with eating
whatever fruits and vegetables are available in the forest.

PURPORT

It is essential for a devotee to worship the form of the Lord and not
only to meditate upon the form of the Lord within his mind with the
chanting of the mantra given by the spiritual master. The worship of the
form must be present. The impersonalist takes unnecessary trouble to
meditate upon or worship something impersonal, but this is very trouble-
some, and the path is very precarious. We are not advised to follow the
impersonalist way of meditating or worshiping the Lord. Dhruva Maharaja
was advised to worship a form made of earth and water because in the
jungle, if it is not possible to have a form made of metal, wood or stone,
the best process is to take earth mixed with water and make a form of the
Lord and worship Him. The devotee should not be anxious about cooking
food; whatever is available in the forest or in the city among the fruit and
vegetable groups should be offered to the Deity, and the devotee should
be satisfied eating that. He should not be anxious to have very palatable
dishes. Of course, wherever it is possible, one should offer the Deities the
best foodstuffs, prepared within the category of fruits and vegetables,
cooked or uncooked. The important factor is that the devotee should be
regulated (mita-bhuk); that is one of the good qualifications of a devotee.
He should not hanker to satisfy the tongue with a particular kind of food-
stuff. He should be satisfied to eal whatever prasadam is available by the
grace of the Lord.

TRANSLATION

My dear Dhruva, besides worshiping the Deity and chanting the mantra
three times a day, you should meditate upon the transcendental activities
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His different incarnations, as
exhibited by His supreme will and personal potencies.

PURPORT

Devotional service comprises nine prescribed practices—hearing,
chanting, remembering, worshiping, serving, offering everything to the
Deity, etc. Here Dhruva Maharaja is advised not only to meditate on the
form of the Lord, but to think of His transcendental pastimes in His
different incarnations. Mayavadi philosophers take the incarnation of the
Lord to be in the same category as the ordinary living entity. This is a
great mistake. The incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is
not forced to act by the material laws of nature. The word sveccha is used
here to indicate that He appears out of His supreme will. The conditioned
soul is forced to accepl a particular type of body according to his karma
given by the laws of material nature under the direction of the Supreme
Lord. But when the Lord appears, He is not forced by the dictation of
material nature; He appears as He likes by His own internal potency.
That is the difference. The conditioned soul accepts a particular type of
body, such as the body of a hog, by his work and by the superior
authority of material nature. But when Lord Krsna appears in the
incarnation of a boar, He is not the same kind of hog as an ordinary
animal. Krsna appears as Varaha avatdra in an expansive feature which
cannot be compared to an ordinary hog’s. His appearance and disappear-
ance are inconceivable to us. In the Bhagavad-gita it is clearly said that He
appears by His own internal potency for the protection of the Hevolees
and the annihilation of the nondevotees. A devotee should always consider
that Krsna does nol appear as an ordinary human being or ordinary
beast; His appearance as Varaha-marti or a horse or tortoise is an exhibition
of His internal potency. In the Brahma-sarihita it is said, ananda-cinmaya-
rasa-pratibhavitabhih: one should not mistake the appearance of the Lord
as a human being or a beast to be the same as the birth of an ordinary
conditioned soul, who is forced to appear by the laws of nature, whether


--- Page 331 ---
Text 58] Dhruva Maharaja Leaves Home for the Forest 337
as an animal, as a human being or as a demigod. This kind of thinking is
offensive. Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu has condemned the Mayavadis as
offensive to the Supreme Personality of Godhead because of their
thinking that the Lord and the conditioned living entities are one and the
same.

Narada advises Dhruva to meditate on the pastimes of the Lord, which
is as good as the meditation of concentrating one’s mind on the form of
the Lord. As meditation on any form of the Lord is valuable, so is
chanting of different names of the Lord, such as Hari, Govinda and
Narayana. But in this age we are especially advised to chant the Hare
Krsna mantra as enunciated in the astra: Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna
Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.

TRANSLATION

One should follow in the footsteps of previous devotees regarding how
to worship the Supreme Lord with the prescribed paraphernalia, or one
should offer worship within the heart by reciting the mantra to the
Personality of Godhead, who is nondifferent from the mantra.

PURPORT

It is recommended here that even if one cannot arrange to worship the
forms of the Lord with all recommended paraphernalia, one can simply
think about the form of the Lord and mentally offer everything recom-
mended in the $dstras, including flowers, candana pulp, conchshell,
umbrella, fan and camara. One can meditate upon offering and chant the


--- Page 332 ---
338 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 8
twelve-syllable mantra, orh namo bhagavate vasudevaya. Since the mantra
and the Supreme Personality of Godhead are nondifferent, one can worship
the form of the Lord with the mantra in the absence of physical para-
phernalia. The story of the brahmana who worshiped the Lord within his
mind, as related in Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu, or The Nectar of Devotion,
should be consulted in this connection. If paraphernalia is not present
physically, one can think of the items and offer them to the Deity by
chanting the mantra. Such are the liberal and potent facilities in the
process of devotional service.

development, sense gratification or liberation from the material world, he
is awarded these results.

PURPORT

Devotional service is so potent that one who renders devotional service
can receive whatever he likes as a benediction from the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. The conditioned souls are very attached to the
material world, and thus, by performing religious rites, they want the
material benefits known as dharma and artha.

TRANSLATION

If one is very serious about liberation, then he must stick to the process
of transcendental loving service, engaging twenty-four hours a day in the
highest stage of ecstasy, and he must certainly be aloof from all activities
of sense gratification.

PURPORT

There are different stages of perfection according to different persons’
objectives. Generally people are karmis, for they engage in activities of
sense gratification. Above the karmis arc the jianis, who arc trying to
become liberated from material entanglement. Yogis are still more ad-
vanced because they meditate on the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. And above all these are the devolees, who simply engage in
the transcendental loving service of the Lord; they are situated seriously
on the topmost platform of ecstasy.

Here Dhruva Maharaja is advised that if he has no desire for sense
gratification, then he should directly engage himself in the transcendental
loving service of the Lord. The path of apavarga, or liberation, begins from
the stage called moksa. In this verse the word vimuktaye, “for liberation,”


--- Page 334 ---
340 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 8
is especially mentioned. If one wants to be happy within this material
world, he may aspire to go to the different material planetary systems
where there is a higher standard of sense gratification, but real moksa or
liberation is performed without any such desire. This is explained in the
Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu by the term anyabhilasita-$inyam, ‘without desire
for material sense gratification.” For persons who are still inclined to enjoy
material life in different stages or on different planets, the stage of libera-
tion in bhakti-yoga is not recommended. Only persons who are completely
free from the contamination of sense gratification can execute bhakti-
yoga, or the process of devotional service, very purely. The activities on
the path of apavarga up to the stages of dharma, artha and kama are
meant for sense gratification, but when one comes to the stage of moksa,
the impersonalist liberation, the practitioner wants to merge into the
existence of the Supreme. But that is also sense gratification. When one
goes above the stage of liberation, however, he at once becomes one of the
associates of the Lord to render transcendental loving service. That is
technically called mukti. For this specific vimukti liberation Narada Muni
recommends that one directly engage himself in devotional service.

which is always imprinted with the lotus footprints of Lord Krsna and
which is therefore especially auspicious.

The great sage Narada Muni inquired: My dear King, your face appears
to be withering up, and you look like you have been thinking of something
for a very long time. Why is that? Have you been hampered in following
your path of religious rites, economic development and sense
gratification?
PURPORT
The four stages of advancement of human civilization are religiosity,
economic development, sense gratification and, for some, the stage of
liberation. Narada Muni did not inquire from the King about his liberation,
but only regarding the state management, which is meant for advancement
of the three principles of religiosity, economic development and sense
gratification. Since those who engage in such activities are not interested
in liberation, Narada did not inquire from the King about this. Liberation
is meant for persons who have lost all interest in religious ritualistic cere-
monies, economic development and sense gratification.

even to my son, who is only five years old. I have banished him and his
mother, even though he is a great soul and a great devotee.
PURPORT
In this verse there are some specific words which are to be understood
very carefully. The King said that since he was very much addicted to his
wife, he had lost all his mercy. That is the result of becoming too
affectionate towards women. The King had two wives; the first wife was
Suniti, and the second was Suruci. He was too attached to the second
wife, however, so he could not behave well with Dhruva Maharaja. That
was the cause of Dhruva’s leaving home to perform austerities. Although as
a father the King was affectionate towards his son, he minimized his
affection for Dhruva Maharaja because he was too much addicted to the
second wife. Now he was repenting that both Dhruva Maharaja and his
mother, Suniti, were practically banished. Dhruva Maharija went to the
forest, and since his mother was being neglected by the King, she was,
therefore, almost banished also. The King was repentant for banishing his
boy because Dhruva was only five years old and a father should not banish
his wife and children or neglect their maintenance. Repentant over his
neglect of both Suniti and her son, he was morose, and his face appeared
withered. According to Manu-smrti, one should never desert his wife and
children. In a case where the wife and children are disobedient and do not
follow the principles of home life, they are sometimes given up. But in the
case of Dhruva Maharaja this was not applicable because Dhruva was very
mannerly and obedient. He was, moreover, a great devotee. Such a person
is never to be neglected, yet the King was obliged to banish him. Now he
was very sorry.

cruelty! Out of love and affection the boy was trying to get up on my
lap, but I did not receive him, nor did I even pat him for a moment. Just
imagine how hardhearted I am.

TRANSLATION

The great sage Narada Muni replied: My dear King, please do not be
aggrieved about your son. He is well protected by the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. Although you have no actual information of his influence,
his reputation is already spread all over the world.

PURPORT

Sometimes when we hear that great sages and devotees go to the forest
and engage themselves in devotional service or meditation, we become
surprised: how can one live in the forest and not be taken care of by any-
one? But the answer, given by a great authority, Narada Muni, is that such
persons are well protected by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Sarapagati, or surrender, means acceptance or firm belief that wherever
the surrendered soul lives he is always protected by the Supreme Person-
ality of Godhead; he is never alone or unprotected. Dhruva Maharaja’s
affectionate father thought his young boy, only five years old, to bein a
very precarious position in the jungle, but Narada Muni assured him,
“You do not have sufficient information about the influence of your son.”
Anyone who engages in devotional service anywhere within this universe
is never unprotected.

TRANSLATION
My dear King, your son is very competent. He will perform activities
which would be impossible even for great kings and sages. Very soon he
will complete his task and come back home. You should know that he will
also spread your reputation all over the world.
PURPORT
Here in this verse Narada Muni has described Dhruva Maharaja as prabhu.
This word is applicable to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Some-
times the spiritual master is addressed as Prabhupada. Prabhu means the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, and pada means post. According to
Vaignava philosophy the spiritual master occupies the post of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, or in other words he is the bona fide
representative of the Supreme Lord. Dhruva Maharaja is also described
here as prabhu because he is an acarya of the Vaisnava school. Another
meaning of prabhu is “master of the senses,” just like the word svami
Another significant word is suduskaram, “very difficult to perform.”
What was the task that Dhruva Maharaja undertook? The most difficult
task in life is to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and Dhruva
Maharaja would be able to do that. We must remember that Dhruva
Maharaja was not fickle; he was determined to execute his service and then
come back. Every devotee, therefore, should be determined that in this
life he will be able to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead and by
that process go back home, back to Godhead. That is the perfection of the
highest mission of life.

Elsewhere, Dhruva Maharaja, having arrived at Madhuvana, took his
bath in the River Yamuna and observed fasting in the night with great care
and attention. After that, as advised by the great sage Narada, he engaged
himself in worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

PURPORT

The significance of this particular verse is that Dhruva Maharaja acted
exactly according to the advice of his spiritual master, the great sage Narada
Muni. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti also advises that if we want to be
successful in our attempt to go back to Godhead, we must very seriously
act according to the instruction of the spiritual master. That is the way of
perfection. There need be no anxiety over attaining perfection because if
one follows the instruction given by the spiritual master he is sure to attain
perfection. Our only concern should be how to execute the order of the

spiritual master. A spiritual master is expert in giving special instructions
to each of his disciples, and if the disciple executes the order of the spiritual
master, that is the way of his perfection.

TRANSLATION

For the first month Dhruva Maharaja ate only fruits and berries on
every third day, only to keep his body and soul together, and in this way
he progressed in his worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

PURPORT

Kapittha is a flower which is known in Indian vernacular as kouth. We
do not find an English equivalent for the name of this flower, but its fruit
is generally not accepted by human beings; it is eaten by monkeys in the
forest. Dhruva Maharaja, however, accepted such fruit, not for luxuriant
feasting but just to keep his body and soul together. The body needs food,
but a devotee should not accept foodstuff to satisfy the tongue in sense
gratification. It is recommended in Bhagavad-gita that one should accept
as much food as necessary to keep the body fit, but one should not eat for
luxury. Dhruva Maharaja is an dcarya, and by undergoing severe austerities
and penances he teaches us how one should execute devotional service. We
must carefully know the process of Dhruva Maharaja’s service; how severely
he passed his days will be shown in later verses. We should always remem-
ber that to become a bona fide devotee of the Lord is not an easy task, but
in this age, by the mercy of Lord Caitanya, it has been made very easy. But
if we do not follow even the liberal instructions of l.ord Caitanya, how can


--- Page 343 ---
Text 73] Dhruva Maharaja Leaves Home for the Forest 349
we expect to discharge our regular duties in devotional service? It is not
possible in this age to follow Dhruva Maharaja in his austerity, but the
principles must be followed; we should not disregard the regulative princi-
ples given by our spiritual master, for they make it easier for the con-
ditioned soul. As far as our ISKCON movement is concerned, we simply
ask that one observe the four prohibitive rules, chant sixteen rounds, and,
instead of indulging in luxurious eating for the tongue, simply accept
prasadam offered to the Lord. This does not mean that with our fasting
the Lord should also fast. The Lord should be given foodstuff which is as
nice as possible. But we should not make it a point to satisfy our own
tongues. As far as possible we should accept simple foodstuff, just to keep
the body and soul together to execute devotional service.

It is our duty to remember always that in comparison to Dhruva
Maharaja we are insignificant. We cannot do anything like Dhruva
Maharaja did for self-realization because we are absolutely incompetent to
execute such service. But by Lord Caitanya’s mercy we have been given
all concessions possible for this age, so at least we should always remember
that neglect of our prescribed duties in devotional service will not make us
successful in the mission we have undertaken. It is our duty to follow in
the footsteps of Dhruva Maharaja, for he was very determined. We should
also be determined to finish our duties in executing devotional service
in this life; we should not wait for another life to finish our job.

PURPORT
The yogic principles of meditation are clearly explained here. One has
to fix one’s mind upon the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead
without diversion to any other objective. It is not that one can meditate or
concentrate on an impersonal objective. To try to do so is simply a waste
of time, for it is unnecessarily troublesome, as explained in Bhagavad-gita.

TRANSLATION
When Dhruva Maharaja thus captured the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, who is the refuge of the total material creation and who is the
master of all living entities, the three worlds began to tremble.
PURPORT
In this verse the particular word brahman is very significant. Brahman
means one who not only is the greatest, but who has the potency to expand
to an unlimited extent. How was it possible for Dhruva Maharaja to capture
Brahman within his heart? This question has been very nicely answered by
Jiva Gosvami. He says that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the
origin of Brahman, for since He comprises everything material and spiritual,
there cannot be anything greater than Him. In the Bhagavad-gita also the
Supreme Godhead says, “I am the resting place of Brahman.” Many
persons, especially the Mayavadi philosophers, consider Brahman the
biggest, all-expanding substance, but according to this verse and other
Vedic literatures, such as Bhagavad-gita, the resting place of Brahman is


--- Page 347 ---
Text 79] Dhruva Maharaja Leaves Home for the Forest 353
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, just as the resting place of the sun-
shine is the sun globe. Srila Jiva Gosvami, therefore, says that since the
transcendental form of the Lord is the seed of all greatness, He is the
Supreme Brahman. Since the Supreme Brahman was situated in the heart
of Dhruva Maharaja, he became heavier than the heaviest, and therefore
everything trembled in all three worlds and in the spiritual world.

The mahat-tattva, or the sum total of the material creation, is to be
understood as the ultimate end of all universes, including all the living
entities therein. Brahman is the resort of the mahat-tattva, which includes
all material and spiritual entities. It is described in this connection that the
Supreme Brahman, the Personality of Godhead, is the master of both
pradhana and purusa. Pradhana means subtle matter, such as ether. Purusa
means the spiritual spark living entities who are entangled in that subtle
material existence. These may also be described as para prakrti and apara
prakrti, as stated in Bhagavad-gita. Krsna, being the controller of both the
prakrtis, is thus the master of pradhana and purusa. In the Vedic hymns
also the Supreme Brahman is described as antahpravistah $asta. This indicates
that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is controlling everything and
entering into everything. The Brahma-samhita further confirms this:
andantarastha-paramdnu-cayantarastham: He has not only entered the
universes, but He has entered even into the atom. In Bhagavad-gita Krsna
also says, vistabhy@ham idam krtsnam. The Supreme Personality of God-
head controls everything by entering into everything. By associating con-
stantly with the Supreme Personality in his heart, Dhruva Maharaja
naturally became equal to the greatest, Brahman, by His association, and
thus became the heaviest, and the entire universe trembled. In conclusion,
a person who always concentrates on the transcendental form of Krsna
within his heart can very easily strike the whole world with wonder at his
activities. This is the perfection of yoga performance, as confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita. Yoginam api sarvesam: of all yogis, the bhakti-yogi, who
thinks of Krsna always within his heart and engages in His loving
transcendental service, is the topmost. Ordinary yogis can exhibit wonder-
ful material activities, known as asta-siddhi, eight kinds of yogic perfection,
but a pure devotee of the Lord can surpass these perfections by perform-
ing activities which can make the whole universe tremble.

TRANSLATION

As Dhruva Maharaja, the King’s son, kept himself steadily standing on
one leg, the pressure of his big toe pushed down half the earth, just as an
elephant being carried on a boat rocks the boat left and right with his every
step.

PURPORT

The most significant expression in this verse is parthivarbhaka (501) of
the King”). When Dhruva Maharaja was at home, although he was a king's
son, he was prevented from getting on the lap of his father. But when he
became advanced in self-realization or devotional service, by the pressure
of his toe he could push down the whole earth. That is the difference
between ordinary consciousness and Krsna consciousness. In ordinary
consciousness a king’s son may be refused something even by his father,
but when the same person becomes fully Krsna conscious within his heart,
he can push down the earth with the pressure of his toe.

One cannot argue, “How is it that Dhruva Maharaja, who was prevented
from getting up on the lap of his father, could press down the whole
earth?” This argument is not very much appreciated by the learned, for it
is an example of nagnamatrka logic. By this logic one would think that
because his mother in her childhood was naked she should therefore re-
main naked even when she is grown up. The stepmother of Dhruva
Maharaja might have been thinking in a similar way: since she had refused
to allow him to get up on the lap of his father, how could Dhruva perform
such wonderful activities as pressing down the whole earth? She must


--- Page 349 ---
Text 80] Dhruva Maharaja Leaves Home for the Forest 355
have been very surprised when she learned that Dhruva Maharaja, by
concentrating constantly on the Supreme Personality of Godhead within
his heart, could press down the entire earth, like an elephant who presses
down the boat on which it is loaded.

TRANSLATION
When Dhruva Maharaja became practically one in heaviness with Lord
Visnu, the total consciousness, due to his fully concentrating and closing
all the holes of his body, the total universal breathing became choked up,
and all the big demigods in all the planetary systems felt suffocated and
thus look shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
PURPORT
When hundreds of persons are sitting in an airplane, although they
remain as individual units, they each share in the total force of the air-
plane, which runs at thousands of miles per hour; similarly, when unit
energy is identified with the service of the total energy, the unit energy be-
comes as powerful as the total energy. As explained in the previous verse,
Dhruva Maharaja, because of his spiritual advancement, became almost
the total heaviness, and thus he pressed down the whole earth. Moreover,


--- Page 350 ---
356 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 8
by such spiritual power his unit body became the total body of the
universe. Thus when he closed the holes of his unit body to firmly concen-
trate his mind on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, all the units of the
universe—namely all the living entities, including the big demigods—felt
the pressure of suffocation, as if their breathing were being choked. There-
fore they all took shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead because
they were perplexed as to what had happened.

This example of Dhruva Maharaja’s closing the holes of his personal
body and thereby closing the breathing holes of the total universe clearly
indicates that a devotee, by his personal devotional service, can influence
all the people of the whole world to become devotees of the Lord. If there
is only one pure devotee in pure Krsna consciousness, he can change the
total consciousness of the world into Krsna consciousness. This is not very
difficult to understand if we study the behavior of Dhruva Maharaja.

their breathing processes choked up. We have never experienced such a
thing. Since You are the ultimate shelter of all surrendered souls, we have
therefore approached You; kindly save us from this danger.
PURPORT
Dhruva Maharaja’s influence, attained by executing devotional service
unto the Lord, was felt even by the demigods, who had never before
experienced such a situation. Because of Dhruva Maharaja’s controlling
his breathing, the entire universal breathing process was choked. It is by
the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead that material entities can-
not breathe whereas spiritual entities are able to breathe; material entities
are products of the Lord’s external energy, whereas spiritual entities are
products of the Lord’s internal energy. The demigods approached the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the controller of both kinds of
entities, in order to know why their breathing was choked. The Supreme
Lord is the ultimate goal for the solution to all problems within this
material world. In the spiritual world there are no problems, but the
material world is always problematic. Since the Supreme Personality of
Godhead is the master of both the material and spiritual worlds, it is better
to approach Him in all problematic situations. Those who are devotees,
therefore, have no problems in this material world. Visvarn parna-
sukhayate: devotees are free from all problems because they are fully
surrendered unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For a devotee,
everything in the world is very pleasing because he knows how to use
everything in the transcendental loving service of the Lord.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead replied: My dear demigods, do not
be perturbed by this. It is due to the severe austerity and full determination
of the son of King Uttanapada, who is now fully absorbed in thought of
Me. He has obstructed the universal breathing process. You can safely
return lo your respective homes. I shall stop this boy in his severe acts of
auslerities, and you will be saved from this situation.

PURPORT

Here one word, saigatatma, is misinterpreted by the Mayavadi
philosophers, who say that the self of Dhruva Maharaja became one with
the Supreme Self, the Personality of Godhead. The Mayavadi philosophers
want to prove by this word that the Supersoul and the individual soul
become united in this way and that after such unification the individual
soul has no separate existence. But here it is clearly said by the Supreme
Lord that Dhruva Maharaja was so absorbed in meditation on the thought
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead that He Himself, the universal
consciousness, was attracted to Dhruva. In order to please the demigods,
He wanted to go Himself to Dhruva Maharaja to stop him from this severe
austerity. The Mayavadi philosophers’ conclusion that the Supersoul and
the individual soul become united is not supported by this statement.
Rather, the Supersoul, the Personality of Godhead, wanted to stop Dhruva
Maharaja from this severe austerity.

By pleasing the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one pleases everyone,
just as by watering the root of a tree one satisfies every branch, twig and
leaf of the tree. If one can attract the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
naturally he attracts the whole universe because Krsna is the supreme
cause of the universe. All the demigods were afraid of being totally
vanquished by suffocation, but the Personality of Godhead assured them
that Dhruva Maharaja was a great devotee of the Lord and was not about
to annihilate everyone in the universe. A devotee is never envious of other
living entities.
