Preface

We must know the present need of human society. And what is that
need? Human society is no longer bounded by geographical limits to par-
ticular countries or communities. Human society is broader than in the
Middle Ages, and the world tendency is toward one state or one human
society. The ideals of spiritual communism, according to Srimad-
Bhagavatam, are based more or less on the oneness of the entire human
society, nay, of the entire energy of living beings. The need is felt by
great thinkers to make this a successful ideology. Srimad-Bhagavatam
will fill this need in human society. It begins, therefore, with the apho-
rism of Vedanta philosophy janmady asya yatah to establish the ideal of
a common cause.

Human society, at the present moment, is not in the darkness of
oblivion. It has made rapid progress in the field of material comforts,
education and economic development throughout the entire world. But
there is a pinprick somewhere in the social body at large, and therefore
there are large-scale quarrels, even over less important issues. There is
need of a clue as to how humanity can become one in peace, friendship
and prosperity with a common cause. Srimad-Bhagavatam will fill this
need, for it is a cultural presentation for the re-spiritualization of the
entire human society.

Srimad-Bhagavatam should be introduced also in the schools and col-
leges, for it is recommended by the great student-devotee Prahlada
Maharaja in order to change the demoniac face of society.

(Bhag. 7.6.1)

Disparity in human society is due to lack of principles in a godless
civilization. There is God, or the Almighty One, from whom everything
emanates, by whom everything is maintained and in whom everything

is merged to rest. Material science has tried to find the ultimate source
of creation very insufficiently, but it is a fact that there is one ulti-
mate source of everything that be. This ultimate source is explained
rationally and authoritatively in the beautiful Bhagavatam or Srimad-
Bhagavatam.

Srimad-Bhagavatam is the transcendental science not only for know-
ing the ultimate source of everything but also for knowing our relation
with Him and our duty towards perfection of the human society on the
basis of this perfect knowledge. It is powerful reading matter in the
Sanskrit language, and it is now rendered into English elaborately so that
simply by a careful reading one will know God perfectly well, so much so
that the reader will be sufficiently educated to defend himself from the
onslaught of atheists. Over and above this, the reader will be able to con-
vert others to accepting God as a concrete principle.

Srimad-Bhagavatam begins with the definition of the ultimate source.
It is a bona fide commentary on the Vedanta-siitra by the same author,
Srila Vyasadeva, and gradually it develops into nine cantos up to the
highest state of God realization. The only qualification one needs to study
this great book of transcendental knowledge is to proceed step by step
cautiously and not jump forward haphazardly like with an ordinary
book. It should be gone through chapter by chapter, one after another.
The reading matter is so arranged with its original Sanskrit text, its
English transliteration, synonyms, translation and purports so that one is
sure to become a God-realized soul at the end of finishing the first nine
cantos.

The Tenth Canto is distinct from the first nine cantos because it deals
directly with the transcendental activities of the Personality of Godhead
Sri Krsna. One will be unable to capture the effects of the Tenth Canto
without going through the first nine cantos. The book is complete in
twelve cantos, each independent, but it is good for all to read them in
small installments one after another.

I must admit my frailties in presenting Srimad-Bhagavatam, but still
I am hopeful of its good reception by the thinkers and leaders of society
on the strength of the following statement of Srimad-Bhagavatam
(1.5.11):

tad-vag-visargo janatagha-viplavo
yasmin prati-slokam abaddhavaty api

“On the other hand, that literature which is full with descriptions of the
transcendental glories of the name, fame, form and pastimes of the un-
limited Supreme Lord is a transcendental creation meant to bring about a
revolution in the impious life of a misdirected civilization. Such tran-
scendental literatures, even though irregularly composed, are heard,

sung and accepted by purified men who are thoroughly honest.”

Introduction

“This Bhagavata Purana is as brilliant as the sun, and it has arisen
just after the departure of Lord Krsna to His own abode, accompanied by
religion, knowledge, etc. Persons who have lost their vision due to the
dense darkness of ignorance in the age of Kali shall get light from this
Purana.” (Srimad-Bhagavatam 1.3.43)

The timeless wisdom of India is expressed in the Vedas, ancient
Sanskrit texts that touch upon all fields of human knowledge. Originally
preserved through oral tradition, the Vedas were first put into writing
five thousand years ago by Srila Vyasadeva, the “literary incarnation of
God.” After compiling the Vedas, Vyasadeva set forth their essence in
the aphorisms known as Vedanta-sitras. Srimad-Bhagavatam is
Vyasadeva’s commentary on his own Vedanta-sitras. It was written in
the maturity of his spiritual life under the direction of Narada Muni, his
spiritual master. Referred to as “the ripened fruit of the tree of Vedic
literature,” Srimad-Bhagavatam is the most complete and authoritative
exposition of Vedic knowledge.

After compiling the Bhagavatam, Vyasa impressed the synopsis of it
upon his son, the sage Sukadeva Gosviami. Sukadeva Gosvimi subse-
quently recited the entire Bhagavatam to Maharaja Pariksit in an assem-
bly of learned saints on the bank of the Ganges at Hastinapura (now
Delhi). Maharaja Pariksit was the emperor of the world and was a great
rajarsi (saintly king). Having received a warning that he would die
within a week, he renounced his entire kingdom and retired to the bank
of the Ganges to fast until death and receive spiritual enlightenment.
The Bhagavatam begins with Emperor Pariksit’s sober inquiry to
Sukadeva Gosvami: “You are the spiritual master of great saints and
devotees. I am therefore begging you to show the way of perfection for
all persons, and especially for one who is about to die. Please let me know
what a man should hear, chant, remember and worship, and also what he
should not do. Please explain all this to me.”

Sukadeva Gosvami’s answer to this question, and numerous other
questions posed by Maharaja Pariksit, concerning everything from the
nature of the self to the origin of the universe, held the assembled sages

207

xiv Srimad-Bhagavatam

in rapt attention continuously for the seven days leading to the King’s
death. The sage Sita Gosvami, who was present on the bank of the
Ganges when Sukadeva Gosvami first recited Srimad-Bhagavatam, later
repeated the Bhagavatam before a gathering of sages in the forest of
Naimisaranya. Those sages, concerned about the spiritual welfare of the
people in general, had gathered to perform a long, continuous chain of
sacrifices to counteract the degrading influence of the incipient age of
Kali. In response to the sages’ request that he speak the essence of Vedic
wisdom, Sita Gosvami repeated from memory the entire eighteen thou-
sand verses of Srimad-Bhdgavatam, as spoken by Sukadeva Gosvami to
Maharaja Pariksit. .

The reader of Srimad-Bhagavatam hears Sita Gosvami relate the
questions of Maharaja Pariksit and the answers of Sukadeva Gosvami.
Also, Sata Gosvami sometimes responds directly to questions put by
Saunaka Rsi, the spokesman for the sages gathered at Naimisaranya. One
therefore simultaneously hears two dialogues: one between Maharaja
Pariksit and Sukadeva Gosvami on the bank of the Ganges, and another
at Naimisaranya between Siita Gosvami and the sages at Naimisaranya
Forest, headed by Saunaka Rsi. Furthermore, while instructing King
Pariksit, Sukadeva Gosvami often relates historical episodes and gives
accounts of lengthy philosophical discussions between such great souls as
the saint Maitreya and his disciple Vidura. With this understanding of
the history of the Bhagavatam, the reader will easily be able to follow its
intermingling of dialogues and events from various sources. Since philo-
sophical wisdom, not chronological order, is most important in the text,
one need only be attentive to the subject matter of Srimad-Bhagavatam
to appreciate fully its profound message.

The translator of this edition compares the Bhagavatam to sugar
candy —wherever you taste it, you will find it equally sweet and
relishable. Therefore, to taste the sweetness of the Bhagavatam, one may
begin by reading any of its volumes. After such an introductory taste,
however, the serious reader is best advised to go back to Volume One of
the First Canto and then proceed through the Bhagavatam, volume after
volume, in its natural order.

This edition of the Bhagavatam is the first complete English transla-
tion of this important text with an elaborate commentary, and it is the
first widely available to the English-speaking public. It is the product of

Introduction x
the scholarly and devotional effort of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhakti-
vedanta Swami Prabhupada, the world’s most distinguished teacher of
Indian religious and philosophical thought. His consummate Sanskrit
scholarship and intimate familiarity with Vedic culture and thought as
well as the modern way of life combine to reveal to the West a magnifi-
cent exposition of this important classic.

Readers will find this work of value for many reasons. For those in-
terested in the classical roots of Indian civilization, it serves as a vast
reservoir of detailed information on virtually every one of its aspects.
For students of comparative philosophy and religion, the Bhagavatam
offers a penetrating view into the meaning of India’s profound spiritual
heritage. To sociologists and anthropologists, the Bhagavatam reveals the
practical workings of a peaceful and scientifically organized Vedic
culture, whose institutions were integrated on the basis of a highly
developed spiritual world view. Students of literature will discover the
Bhagavatam to be a masterpiece of majestic poetry. For students of psy-
chology, the text provides important perspectives on the nature of con-
sciousness, human behavior and the philosophical study of identity.
Finally, to those seeking spiritual insight, the Bhagavatam offers simple
and practical guidance for attainment of the highest self-knowledge and
realization of the Absolute Truth. The entire multivolume text, pre-
sented by the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, promises to occupy a significant
place in the intellectual, cultural and spiritual life of modern man for a
long time to come.

CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
The Dynasties
of the Sons of Purarava
Ayu, the eldest son of Purarava, had five sons. This chapter describes
the dynasties of four of them, beginning with Ksatravrddha.

Ayu, the son of Puriirava, had five sons —Nahusa, Ksatravrddha, Raji,
Rabha and Anena. The son of Ksatravrddha was Suhotra, who had three
sons, named Kasya, Kuda and Grtsamada. The son of Grtsamada was
Sunaka, and his son was Saunaka. The son of Kasya was Kasi. From Kasi
came the sons and grandsons known as Rastra, Dirghatama and then
Dhanvantari, who was the inaugurator of medical science and was a
Saktyavesa incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Vasudeva. The descendants of Dhanvantari were Ketuman, Bhimaratha,
Divodasa and Dyuman, who was also known as Pratardana, Satrujit,
Vatsa, Rtadhvaja and Kuvalayasva. The son of Dyuman was Alarka, who
reigned over the kingdom for many, many years. Following in the
dynasty of Alarka were Santati, Sunitha, Niketana, Dharmaketu,
Satyaketu, Dhrstaketu, Sukumara, Vitihotra, Bharga and Bhargabhiami.
All of them belonged to the dynasty of Kasi, the descendant of
Ksatravrddha.

The son of Rabha was Rabhasa, and his son was Gambhira. Gambhira’s
son was Akriya, and from Akriya came Brahmavit. The son of Anena
was Suddha, and his son was Suci. The son of Suci was Citrakrt, whose
son was Santaraja. Raji had five hundred sons, all of extraordinary
strength. Raji was personally very powerful and was given the kingdom
of heaven by Lord Indra. Later, after Raji’s death, when the sons of Raji
refused to return the kingdom to Indra, by Brhaspati’s arrangement they
became unintelligent, and Lord Indra conquered them.

The grandson of Ksatravrddha named Kusa gave birth to a son named
Prati. From Prati came Saiijaya; from Safjaya, Jaya; from Jaya, Krta;
and from Krta, Haryabala. The son of Haryabala was Sahadeva; the son
of Sahadeva, Hina; the son of Hina, Jayasena; the son of Jayasena,
Sankrti; and the son of Sankrti, Jaya.

PURPORT

Raji conquered the kingdom of heaven, and therefore when Indra, the
heavenly king, begged Raji’s sons to return it, they refused. Because they
had not taken the heavenly kingdom from Indra but had inherited it
from their father, they considered it their paternal property. Why then
should they return it to the demigods?

TRANSLATION
From Haryabala came a son named Sahadeva, and from Sahadeva
came Hina. The son of Hina was Jayasena, and the son of Jayasena
was Sankrti. The son of Sankrti was the powerful and expert
fighter named Jaya. These kings were the members of the
Ksatravrddha dynasty. Now let me describe to you the dynasty of
Nahusa.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Seventeenth
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “The Dynasties of the Sons
of Puriirava.”

CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
King Yayati Regains His Youth
This chapter gives the history of King Yayati, the son of Nahusa.
Among Yayati’s five sons, the youngest son, Piru, accepted Yayati’s
invalidity.

When Nahusa, who had six sons, was cursed to become a python, his
eldest son, Yati, took sannydsa, and therefore the next son, Yayati, was
enthroned as king. By providence, Yayati married the daughter of
Sukracarya. Sukraciarya was a brahmana and Yayati a ksatriya, but
Yayati married her nonetheless. Sukracirya’s daughter, named
Devayani, had a girl friend named Sarmistha, who was the daughter of
Vrsaparva. King Yayati married Sarmistha also. The history of this mar-
riage is as follows. Once Sarmistha was sporting in the water with thou-
sands of her girl friends, and Devayani was also there. When the young
girls saw Lord Siva, seated on his bull with Uma, they immediately
dressed themselves, but Sarmistha mistakenly put on Devayani’s clothes.
Devayani, being very angry, rebuked Sarmistha, who also became very
angry and responded by rebuking Devayani and throwing her into a
well. By chance, King Yayiti came to that well to drink water, and he
found Devayini and rescued her. Thus Devayini accepted Maharaja
Yayati as her husband. Thereafter, Devayani, crying loudly, told her
father about Sarmistha’s behavior. Upon hearing of this incident,
Sukracarya was very angry and wanted to chastise Vrsaparva,
Sarmistha’s father. Vrsaparva, however, satisfied Sukracarya by offering
Sarmistha as Devayani’s maidservant. Thus Sarmistha, as the maidser-
vant of Devayani, also went to the house of Devayani’s husband. When
Sarmistha found her friend Devayani with a son she also desired to have
a son. Therefore, at the proper time for conception, she also requested
Maharaja Yayati for sex. When Sarmistha became pregnant also,
Devayani was very envious. In great anger, she immediately left for her
father’s house and told her father everything. Sukracarya again became
angry and cursed Maharaja Yayati to become old, but when Yayati begged

14 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 18
Sukracarya to be merciful to him, Sukracarya gave him the benediction
that he could transfer his old age and invalidity to some young man.
Yayati exchanged his old age for the youth of his youngest son, 2010, and
thus he was able to enjoy with young girls.

rajyam—the kingdom; na aicchat—did not accept; yatih—the eldest
son, Yati; pitra—by his father; dattam—offered; tat-parinama-vit—
knowing the result of becoming powerful as a king; yatra—wherein;
pravistah—having entered; purusah—such a person; atmanam—self-
realization; na—not; avabudhyate—will take seriously and understand.
TRANSLATION
When one enters the post of king or head of the government,
one cannot understand the meaning of self-realization. Knowing
this, Yati, the eldest son of Nahusa, did not accept the power to
rule, although it was offered by his father.
PURPORT
Self-realization is the prime objective of human civilization, and it is
regarded seriously by those who are situated in the mode of goodness and
have developed the brahminical qualities. Ksatriyas are generally en-
dowed with material qualities conducive to gaining material wealth and
enjoying sense gratification, but those who are spiritually advanced are
not interested in material opulence. Indeed, they accept only the bare
necessities for a life of spiritual advancement in self-realization. It is
specifically mentioned here that if one enters political life, especially in
the modern day, one looses the chance for human perfection. Nonethe-
less, one can attain the highest perfection if one hears Srimad-
Bhagavatam. This hearing is described as nityarh bhagavata-sevaya.
Maharaja Pariksit was involved in politics, but because at the end of his
life he heard Srimad-Bhagavatam from Sukadeva Gosvami, he attained
perfection very easily. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has therefore
suggested:
sthane sthitah Sruti-gatam tanu-van-manobhir
ye praya$o Jjita jito ‘py asi tais tri-lokyam
(Bhag. 10.14.3)
Regardless of whether one is in the mode of passion, ignorance or good-
ness, if one regularly hears Srimad-Bhagavatam from the self-realized
soul, one is freed from the bondage of material involvement.

saintly brahmanas cursed Nahusa to fall from the heavenly planets

became the king.

Maharaja Pariksit said: Sukracarya was a very powerful
brahmana, and Maharaja Yayati was a ksatriya. Therefore I am
curious to know how there occurred this pratiloma marriage be-
tween a ksatriya and a brahmana.
PURPORT
According to the Vedic system, marriages between ksatriyas and
ksatriyas or between brahmanas and brahmanas are the general custom.
If marriages sometimes take place between different classes, these


--- Page 23 ---
18 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 18
marriages are of two types, namely anuloma and pratiloma. Anuloma,
marriage between a brahmana and the daughter of a ksatriya, is per-
missible, but pratiloma, marriage between a ksatriya and the daughter of
a brahmana, is not generally allowed. Therefore Maharaja Pariksit was
curious about how Sukracarya, a powerful brahmana, could accept the
principle of pratiloma. Maharaja Pariksit was eager to know the cause for
this uncommon marriage.

directed the path of good fortune, the path of Vedic civilization,
and because they are the only worshipable objects within this
world, they are offered prayers and worshiped even by the great
demigods, the directors of the various planets, and even by the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Supersoul, the supreme
purifier, the husband of the goddess of fortune. And we are even
more respectable because we are in the dynasty of Bhrgu. Yet al-
though this woman’s father, being among the demons, is our disci-
ple, she has put on my dress, exactly like a 60018 taking charge of
Vedic knowledge.

You beggar, since you don’t understand your position, why

PURPORT
Crows have no independent life; they fully depend on the remnants of
foodstuffs thrown by householders into the garbage tank. Therefore, be-
cause a brahmana depends on his disciples, when Sarmistha was heavily
rebuked by Devayani she charged Devayani with belonging to a family of
crowlike beggars. It is the nature of women to fight verbally at even a
slight provocation. As we see from this incident, this has been their
nature for a long, long time.

husband and wife has been made possible by providence, not by
any human being.

While taking Devayani out of the well, King Yayiti must certainly
have appreciated her youthful beauty, and therefore he might have
asked her which caste she belonged to. Thus Devayani would have im-

mediately replied, “We are already married because you have accepted
my hand.” Uniting the hands of the bride and bridegroom is a system
perpetually existing in all societies. Therefore, as soon as Yayati accepted
Devayani’s hand, they could be regarded as married. Because Devayani
was enamored with the hero Yayati, she requested him not to change his
mind and let another come to marry her.

who has died untimely. This art, called mrta-safijivani, was especially
used during wartime. When there was a war, soldiers would certainly die
untimely, but if a soldier’s body was intact, he could be brought to life
again by this art of mrta-safijivani. This art was known to Sukracarya
and many others, and Kaca, the son of Brhaspati, became Sukracarya’s
student to learn it. Devayani desired to have Kaca as her husband, but
Kaca, out of regard for Sukracarya, looked upon the guru’s daughter as a
respectable superior and therefore refused to marry her. Devayani
angrily cursed Kaca by saying that although he had learned the art of
mrta-sarjivani from her father, it would be useless. When cursed in this
way, Kaca retaliated by cursing Devayani never to have a husband who
was a brahmana. Because Devayani liked Yayati, who was a ksatriya, she
requested him to accept her as his bona fide wife. Although this would be
pratiloma-vivaha, a marriage between the daughter of a high family and
the son of a lower family, she explained that this arrangement was made
by providence.

PURPORT

According to the Vedic system, the parents would consider the
horoscopes of the boy and girl who were to be married. If according to
astrological calculations the boy and girl were compatible in every
respect, the match was called yotaka and the marriage would be ac-
cepted. Even fifty years ago, this system was current in Hindu society.
Regardless of the affluence of the boy or the personal beauty of the girl,
without this astrological compatibility the marriage would not take place.
A person is born in one of three categories, known as deva-gana,
manusya-gana and raksasa-gana. In different parts of the universe
there are demigods and demons, and in human society also some people
resemble demigods whereas others resemble demons. If according to
astrological calculations there was conflict between a godly and a
demoniac nature, the marriage would not take place. Similarly, there
were calculations of pratiloma and anuloma. The central idea is that if
the boy and girl were on an equal level the marriage would be happy,
whereas inequality would lead to unhappiness. Because care is no longer
taken in marriage, we now find many divorces. Indeed, divorce has now
become a common affair, although formerly one’s marriage would con-
tinue lifelong, and the affection between husband and wife was so great
that the wife would voluntarily die when her husband died or would
remain a faithful widow throughout her entire life. Now, of course, this
is no longer possible, for human society has fallen to the level of animal
society. Marriage now takes place simply by agreement. Dampatye
’bhirucir hetuh (Bhag. 12.2.3). The word abhiruci means ‘“‘agreement.”
If the boy and girl simply agree to marry, the marriage takes place. But
when the Vedic system is not rigidly observed, marriage frequently ends
in divorce.

As Sukracarya listened to what had happened to Devayani, his

priesthood and praising the profession of uificha-vrtti [collecting
grains from the fields], he left home with his daughter.
PURPORT
When a brahmana adopts the profession of a kapota, or pigeon, he
lives by collecting grains from the field. This is called wicha-vrtti. A

brahmana who takes to this usicha-vrtti profession is called first class be-
cause he depends completely on the mercy of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead and does not beg from anyone. Although the profession of beg-
ging is allowed for a brahmana or sannyasi, one does better if he can
avoid such a profession and completely depend on the mercy of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead for maintenance. Sukracirya was cer-
tainly very sorry that because of his daughter’s complaint he had to go to
his disciple to beg some mercy, which he was obliged to do because he
had accepted the profession of priesthood. In his heart, Sukracarya did
not like his profession, but since he had accepted it, he was obliged to go
unwillingly to his disciple to settle the grievance submitted by his
daughter.

The powerful Sukracarya was angry for a few moments, but
upon being satisfied he said to Vrsaparva: My dear King, kindly
fulfill the desire of Devayani, for she is my daughter and in this
world I cannot give her up or neglect her.
PURPORT
Sometimes a great personality like Sukracarya cannot neglect sons and
daughters, for sons and daughters are by nature dependent on their
father and the father has affection for them. Although Sukracirya knew
that the quarrel between Devayani and Sarmistha was childish, as
Devayani’s father he had to side with his daughter. He did not like to do
this, but he was obliged to because of affection. He plainly admitted that
although he should not have asked the King for mercy for his daughter,
because of affection he could not avoid doing so.

Therefore he carried out Sukracirya’s order and served him like a
slave. He gave his daughter Sarmistha to Devayani, and Sarmistha
served Devayiani like a slave, along with thousands of other
women.
PURPORT

In the beginning of these affairs concerning Sarmistha and Devayant,
we saw that Sarmistha had many friends. Now these friends became
maidservants of Devayani. When a girl married a ksatriya king, it was
customary for all her girl friends to go with her to her husband’s house.
For instance, when Vasudeva married Devaki, the mother of Krsna, he
married all six of her sisters, and she also had many friends who ac-
companied her. A king would maintain not only his wife but also the
many friends and maidservants of his wife. Some of these maidservants
would become pregnant and give birth to children. Such children were
accepted as ddsi-putra, the sons of the maidservants, and the king would
maintain them. The female population is always greater than the male,
but since a woman needs to be protected by a man, the king would main-
tain many girls, who acted either as friends or as maidservants of the
queen. In the history of Krsna’s household life we find that Krsna mar-
ried 16,108 wives. These were not maidservants but direct queens, and
Krsna expanded Himself into 16,108 forms to maintain different
establishments for each and every wife. This is not possible for ordinary
men. Therefore although the kings had to maintain many, many servants
and wives, not all of them had different establishments.

arthitah—being requested; apatye—for a son; dharmam—religious
principles; ca—as well as; aveksya—considering; dharma-vit—aware of
all religious principles; smaran—remembering; Sukra-vacah—the

Sarmistha).

TRANSLATION

When Princess Sarmistha begged King Yayati for a son, the King
was certainly aware of the principles of religion, and therefore he
agreed to fulfill her desire. Although he remembered the warning
of Sukracarya, he thought of this union as the desire of the
Supreme, and thus he had sex with Sarmistha.

PURPORT

King Yayati was completely aware of the duty of a ksatriya. When a
ksatriya is approached by a woman, he cannot deny her. This is a
religious principle. Consequently, when Dharmaraja, Yudhisthira, saw
Arjuna unhappy after Arjuna returned from Dvaraka, he asked whether
Arjuna had refused a woman who had begged for a son. Although
Maharaja Yayati remembered Sukracirya’s warning, he could not refuse
Sarmistha. He thought it wise to give her a son, and thus he had sexual
intercourse with her after her menstrual period. This kind of lust is not
against religious principles. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (7.11),
dharmaviruddho bhitesu kimo smi: sex life not contrary to the prin-
ciples of religion is sanctioned by Krsna. Because Sarmistha, the
daughter of a king, had begged Yayati for a son, their combination was
not lust but an act of religion.

then replied, “You may exchange your old age with someone who
will agree to transfer his youth to you.”

When King Yayati said that he had not yet satisfied his lusty desires
with Sukracarya’s daughter, Sukracarya saw that it was against the in-
terests of his own daughter for Yayati to continue in old age and in-
validity, for certainly his lusty daughter would not be satisfied.
Therefore Sukriacarya blessed his son-in-law by saying that he could ex-
change his old age for someone else’s youth. He indicated that if Yayati’s
son would exchange his youth for Yayati’s old age, Yayati could continue
to enjoy sex with Devayani.

Text 40] King Yayati Regains His Youth 41
PURPORT
This is the nature of lusty desires. In Bhagavad-gita (7.20) it is said,
kamais tais tair hrta-jianah: when one is too attached to sense gratifica-
tion, he actually loses his sense. The word hrta-jianah refers to one who
has lost his sense. Here is an example: the father shamelessly asked his
son to exchange youth for old age. Of course, the entire world is under
such illusion. Therefore it is said that everyone is pramattah, or ex-
clusively mad. Nianam pramattah kurute vikarma: when one becomes
almost like a madman, he indulges in sex and sense gratification. Sex and
sense gratification can be controlled, however, and one achieves perfec-
tion when he has no desires for sex. This is possible only when one is
fully Krsna conscious.

“Since I have been engaged in the transcendental loving service of
Krsna, realizing ever-new pleasure in Him, whenever I think of sex
pleasure, I spit at the thought, and my lips curl with distaste.” Sexual
desire can be stopped only when one is fully Krsna conscious, and not
otherwise. As long as one has desires for sex, one must change his body
and transmigrate from one body to another to enjoy sex in different
species or forms. But although the forms may differ, the business of sex
15 the same. Therefore it is said, punah punas carvita-carvananam.
Those who are very much attached to sex transmigrate from one body to
another, with the same business of “chewing the chewed,” tasting sex
enjoyment as a dog, sex enjoyment as a hog, sex enjoyment as a demigod,
and so on.

TRANSLATION
Yadu replied: My dear father, you have already achieved old age,
although you also were a young man. But I do not welcome your
old age and invalidity, for unless one enjoys material happiness,
one cannot attain renunciation.
PURPORT
Renunciation of material enjoyment is the ultimate goal of human
life. Therefore the varndasrama institution is most scientific. It aims at
giving one the facility to return home, back to Godhead, which one can-
not do without completely renouncing all connections with the material
world. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu said, niskificanasya bhagavad-
bhajanonmukhasya: one who wants to go back home, back to Godhead,
must be niskificana, free from all affinity for material enjoyment.
Brahmany upasamasrayam: unless one is fully renounced, one cannot
engage in devotional service or stay in Brahman. Devotional service is
rendered on the Brahman platform. Therefore, unless one attains the
Brahman platform, or spiritual platform, one cannot engage in devo-
tional service; or, in other words, a person engaged in devotional service
is already on the Brahman platform.

“One who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in
any circumstance, at once transcends the modes of material nature and
thus comes to the level of Brahman.” (Bg. 14.26) If one attains devo-
tional service, therefore, he is certainly liberated. Generally, unless one
enjoys material happiness, one cannot attain renunciation. Varnasrama
therefore gives the opportunity for gradual elevation. Yadu, the son of
Maharaja Yayati, explained that he was unable to give up his youth, for
he wanted to use it to attain the renounced order in the future.

Maharaja Yadu was different from his brothers. As stated in the next
verse, turvasu$ coditah pitra druhyus canus ca bharata/ pratyacakhyur
adharmajiiah. Maharaja Yadu’s brothers refused to accept their father’s
proposal because they were not completely aware of dharma. To accept
orders that follow religious principles, especially the orders of one’s
father, is very important. Therefore when the brothers of Maharaja Yadu
refused their father’s order, this was certainly irreligious. Maharaja
Yadu’s refusal, however, was religious. As stated in the Tenth Canto,
yado$ ca dharma-$ilasya: Maharaja Yadu was completely aware of the
principles of religion. The ultimate principle of religion is to engage
oneself in devotional service to the Lord. Maharaja Yadu was very eager
to engage himself in the Lord’s service, but there was an impediment:
during youth the material desire to enjoy the material senses is certainly
present, and unless one fully satisfies these lusty desires in youth, there
is a chance of one’s being disturbed in rendering service to the Lord. We
have actually seen that many sannydsis who accept sannyasa pre-
maturely, not having satisfied their material desires, fall down because
they are disturbed. Therefore the general process is to go through
grhastha life and vanaprastha life and finally come to sannyasa and de-
vote oneself completely to the service of the Lord. Maharaja Yadu was
ready to accept his father’s order and exchange youth for old age because
he was confident that the youth taken by his father would be returned.
But because this exchange would delay his complete engagement in de-
votional service, he did not want to accept his father’s old age, for he was
eager to achieve freedom from disturbances. Moreover, among the de-
scendants of Yadu would be Lord Krsna. Therefore, because Yadu was


--- Page 49 ---
44 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 18
eager to see the Lord’s appearance in his dynasty as soon as possible,
Yadu refused to accept his father’s proposal. This was not irreligious,
however, because Yadu’s purpose was to serve the Lord. Because Yadu
was a faithful servant of the Lord, Lord Krsna appeared in his dynasty.
As confirmed in the prayers of Kunti, yadoh priyasyanvavaye. Yadu was
very dear to Krsna, who was therefore eager to descend in Yadu’s
dynasty. In conclusion, Mahariaja Yadu should not be considered
adharma-jiia, ignorant of religious principles, as the next verse desig-
nates his brothers. He was like the four Sanakas (catuh-sana), who
refused the order of their father, Brahma, for the sake of a better cause.
Because the four Kumaras wanted to engage themselves completely in
the service of the Lord as brahmacaris, their refusal to obey their
father’s order was not irreligious.

O Maharaja Pariksit, Yayati similarly requested his sons

thought that their flickering youth was eternal, and therefore they

TRANSLATION

Piru replied: O Your Majesty, who in this world can repay his
debt to his father? By the mercy of one’s father, one gets the
human form of life, which can enable one to become an associate
of the Supreme Lord.

PURPORT

The father gives the seed of the body, and this seed gradually grows
and develops until one ultimately attains the developed human body,
with consciousness higher than that of the animals. In the human body
one can be elevated to the higher planets, and, furthermore, if one culti-
vates Krsna consciousness, one can return home, back to Godhead. This
important human body is obtained by the grace of the father, and
therefore everyone is indebted to his father. Of course, in other lives one
also gets a father and mother; even cats and dogs have fathers and
mothers. But in the human form of life the father and mother can award
their son the greatest benediction by teaching him to become a devotee.
When one becomes a devotee, he achieves the greatest benediction be-
cause he completely averts the repetition of birth and death. Therefore
the father who trains his child in Krsna consciousness is the most
benevolent father in this world. It is said:

Janame janame sabe pitamata paya
krsna guru nahi mile bhaja hari ei
Everyone gets a father and mother, but if one gets the benediction of
Krsna and guru, he can conquer material nature and return home, back
to Godhead.

TRANSLATION
A son who acts by anticipating what his father wants him to do is
first class, one who acts upon receiving his father’s order is second
class, and one who executes his father’s order irreverently is third
class. But a son who refuses his father’s order is like his father’s
stool.
PURPORT
Piru, Yayati’s last son, immediately accepted his father’s proposal, for
although he was the youngest, he was very qualified. Piru thought, “I
should have accepted my father’s proposal before he asked, but I did not.
Therefore I am not a first-class son. I am second class. But I do not wish
to become the lowest type of son, who is compared to his father’s stool.”
One Indian poet has spoken of putra and mitra. Putra means “son,” and
mitra means “urine.” Both a son and urine come from the same
genitals. If a son is an obedient devotee of the Lord he is called putra, or
a real son; otherwise, if he is not learned and is not a devotee, a son is
nothing better than urine.

“After many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surren-
ders unto Me, knowing Me to be the cause of all causes and all that is.
Such a great soul is very rare.” The Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Vasudeva, is one with the Supreme Brahman, the Supreme Absolute
Truth. Everything is in Him in the beginning, and at the end all
manifestations enter into Him. He is situated in everyone’s heart (sar-
vasya caham hrdi sannivistah). And from Him everything has emanated
(janmady asya yatah). All material manifestations, however, are tem-
porary. The word svapna means “dreams,” maya means “illusion,” and
manoratha means “mental creations.” Dreams, illusions and mental cre-
ations are temporary. Similarly, all material creation is temporary, but
Vasudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the eternal Absolute
Truth.

The kad-indriya, or unpurified senses, can be purified if one
engages the senses and the mind in Krsna consciousness. Sarvopadhi-

nations. When one. identifies himself with the material world, his senses
are impure. But when one achieves spiritual realization and identifies
himself as a servant of the Lord, his senses are purified immediately.
Engagement of the purified senses in the service of the Lord is called
bhakti. Hrsikena hrsikesa-sevanari bhaktir ucyate. One may enjoy the

senses for many thousands of years, but unless one purifies the senses,
one cannot be happy.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Eighteenth
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “King Yayati Regains His
Youth.”


--- Page 59 ---
CHAPTER NINETEEN
King Yayati Achieves Liberation
This Nineteenth Chapter describes how Maharaja Yayati achieved lib-
eration after he recounted the figurative story of the he-goat and she-
goat.

After many, many years of sexual relationships and enjoyment in the
material world, King Yayati finally became disgusted with such
materialistic happiness. When satiated with material enjoyment, he
devised a story of a he-goat and she-goat, corresponding to his own life,
and narrated the story before his beloved Devayani. The story is as
follows. Once upon a time, while a goat was searching in a forest for
different types of vegetables to eat, by chance he came to a well, in which
he saw a she-goat. He became attracted to this she-goat and somehow or
other delivered her from the well, and thus they were united. One day
thereafter, when the she-goat saw the he-goat enjoying sex with another
she-goat, she became angry, abandoned the he-goat, and returned to her
brahmana owner, to whom she described her husband’s behavior. The
brahmana became very angry and cursed the he-goat to lose his sexual
power. Thereupon, the he-goat begged the brahmana’s pardon and was
given back the power for sex. Then the he-goat enjoyed sex with the she-
goat for many years, but still he was not satisfied. If one is lusty and
greedy, even the total stock of gold in this world cannot satisfy one’s
lusty desires. These desires are like a fire. One may pour clarified butter
on a blazing fire, but one cannot expect the fire to be extinguished. To
extinguish such a fire, one must adopt a different process. The sastra
therefore advises that by intelligence one renounce the life of enjoyment.
Without great endeavor, those with a poor fund of knowledge cannot
give up sense enjoyment, especially in relation to sex, because a beautiful
woman bewilders even the most learned man. King Yayati, however,
renounced worldly life and divided his property among his sons. He
personally adopted the life of a mendicant, or sannyasi, giving up all at-
traction to material enjoyment, and engaged himself fully in devotional
service to the Lord. Thus he attained perfection. Later, when his beloved

55

wife, Devayani, was freed from her mistaken way of life, she also
engaged herself in the devotional service of the Lord.

TRANSLATION

My dearly beloved wife, daughter of Sukracarya, in this world
there was someone exactly like me. Please listen as I narrate the
history of his life. By hearing about the life of such a householder,
those who have retired from householder life always lament.

PURPORT

Persons who live in the village or town are called grama-nivasi, and
those who live in the forest are called vana-vasi or vanaprastha. The
vanaprasthas, who have retired from family life, generally lament about
their past family life because it engaged them in trying to fulfill lusty
desires. Prahlada Maharaja said that one should retire from family life as
soon as possible, and he described family life as the darkest well
(hitvatma-patarn grham andha-kipam). If one continuously or perma-
nently concentrates on living with his family, he should be understood to
be killing himself. In the Vedic civilization, therefore, it is recommended
that one retire from family life at the end of his fiftieth year and go to
vana, the forest. When he becomes expert or accustomed to forest life, or
retired life as a vanaprastha, he should accept sannyasa. Vanam gato
yad dharim asrayeta. Sannydasa means accepting unalloyed engagement
in the service of the Lord. Vedic civilization therefore recommends four
different stages of life—brahmacarya, grhastha, vanaprastha and
sannyasa. One should be very much ashamed of remaining a house-
holder and not promoting oneself to the two higher stages, namely
vanaprastha and sannyasa.

TRANSLATION
While wandering in the forest, eating to satisfy his senses, a he-
goat by chance approached a well, in which he saw a she-goat
standing helplessly, having fallen into it by the influence of the
results of fruitive activities.
PURPORT
Here Maharaja Yayati compares himself to a he-goat and Devayani to a
she-goat and describes the nature of man and woman. Like a he-goat, a
man searches for sense gratification, wandering here and there, and a
woman without the shelter of a man or husband is like a she-goat that
has fallen into a well. Without being cared for by a man, a woman cannot
be happy. Indeed, she is just like a she-goat that has fallen into a well and
is struggling for existence. Therefore a woman must take shelter of
her father, as Devayani did when under the care of Sukracarya, and then
the father must give the daughter in charity to a suitable man, or a suit-
able man should help the woman by placing her under the care of a hus-
band. This is shown vividly by the life of Devayani. When King Yayati
delivered Devayani from the well, she felt great relief and requested
Yayati to accept her as his wife. But when Maharaja Yayati accepted
Devayani, he became too attached and had sex life not only with her but
with others, like Sarmistha. Yet still he was dissatisfied. Therefore one
should retire by force from such family life as Yayati’s. When one is fully
convinced of the degrading nature of worldly family life, one should
completely renounce this way of life, take sannyasa, and engage himself
fully in the service of the Lord. Then one’s life will be successful.

After planning how to get the she-goat out of the well, the lusty

PURPORT
Attraction for woman is the impetus for economic development, hous-
ing and many other things meant for living comfortably in this material
world. Digging up the earth to make a way out for the she-goat was a
laborious task, but before accepting the she-goat, the he-goat underwent
this labor. Aho grha-ksetra-sutapta-vittair janasya moho ‘yam aham
mameti. The union between male and female provides the impetus for
gaining a nice apartment, a good income, children and friends. Thus one
becomes entangled in this material world.

When the she-goat, who had very nice hips, got out of the well
and saw the very handsome he-goat, she desired to accept him as
her husband. When she did so, many other she-goats also desired
him as their husband because he had a very beautiful bodily struc-
ture and a nice mustache and beard and was expert in discharging

semen and in the art of sexual intercourse. Therefore, just as a
person haunted by a ghost exhibits madness, the best of the he-
goats, attracted by the many she-goats, engaged in erotic activities
and naturally forgot his real business of self-realization.
PURPORT

Materialists are certainly very much attracted by sexual intercourse.
Yan maithunadi-grhamedhi-sukham hi tuccham. Although one becomes
a grhastha, or householder, to enjoy sex life to his heart’s content, one is
never satisfied. Such a lusty materialist is like a goat, for it is said that if
goats meant for slaughter get the opportunity, they enjoy sex before
being killed. Human beings, however, are meant for self-realization.

tapo divyarn putraka yena sattvar
Suddhyed yasmad brahma-saukhyar tv anantam
Human life is meant for realization of the self, the spiritual soul within
the body (dehino ’smin yatha dehe). A materialistic rascal does not know
that he is not the body but a spiritual soul within the body. However, one
should understand his real position and cultivate knowledge by which to
get free from bodily entanglement. Like an unfortunate person who acts
madly, haunted by ghosts, a materialist haunted by the ghost of lust
forgets his real business so that he can enjoy so-called happiness in the
bodily concept of life.

because her husband was lusty, she left him and returned to her
former maintainer.
PURPORT
The word svaminam is significant. Svami means “caretaker” or
“master.” Devayani was cared for by Sukracarya before her marriage,

and after her marriage she was cared for by Yayati, but here the word
svaminam indicates that Devayani left the protection of her husband,
Yayati, and returned to her former protector, Sukracarya. Vedic civiliza-
tion recommends that a woman stay under the protection of a man.
During childhood she should be cared for by her father, in youth by her
husband, and in old age by a grown son. In any stage of life, a woman
should not have independence.

TRANSLATION

The she-goat went to the residence of a brahmana who was the
maintainer of another she-goat, and that brahmana angrily cut off
the he-goat’s dangling testicles. But at the he-goat’s request, the
brahmana later rejoined them by the power of mystic yoga.

PURPORT

Here Sukracarya is figuratively described as the husband of another
she-goat. This indicates that the relationship between husband and wife
in any society, whether higher or lower than human society, is nothing
but the same relationship between he-goat and she-goat, for the material
relationship between man and woman is one of sex. Yan maithunadi-
grhamedhi-sukharh hi tuccham. Sukracarya was an dcdrya, or expert, in
family affairs, which involve the transfer of semen from he-goat to she-
goat. The words kascid aja-svami expressly indicate herein that
Sukricirya was no better than Yayati, for both of them were interested in
family affairs generated by sukra, or semen. Sukracarya first cursed
Yayati to become old so that he could no longer indulge in sex, but when
Sukriacarya saw that Yayati’s emasculation would make his own daughter
a victim of punishment, he used his mystic power to restore Yayati’s
masculinity. Because he used his power of mystic yoga for family affairs
and not to realize the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this exercise in
the magic of yoga was no better than the affairs of he-goats and she-
goats. Yogic power should properly be used to realize the Supreme Per-
0 of Godhead. As the Lord Himself recommends in Bhagavad-gita
6.47):

My dear wife, when the he-goat had his testicles restored, he en-

PURPORT
When one is bound by affection for one’s wife, one is attached to sex-
ual desires that are very difficult to overcome. Therefore, according to
Vedic civilization, one must voluntarily leave his so-called home and go
to the forest. ParnicaSordhvari vanarm vrajet. Human life is meant for

such tapasya, or austerity. By the austerity of voluntarily stopping sex
life at home and going to the forest to engage in spiritual activities in the
association of devotees, one achieves the actual purpose of human life.

PURPORT

If one remains a victim of the so-called beauty of his wife, his family
life is nothing but a dark well. Hitvatma-patarn grham andha-kipam.
Existence in such a dark well is certainly suicidal. If one wants relief
from the miserable condition of material life, one must voluntarily give
up his lusty relationship with his wife; otherwise there is no question of
self-realization. Unless one is extremely advanced in spiritual conscious-
ness, household life is nothing but a dark well in which one commits

least after one’s fiftieth year, one must give up household life and go to
the forest. Vanam gato yad dharim asrayeta. There one should seek

TRANSLATION

A person who is lusty cannot satisfy his mind even if he has
enough of everything in this world, including rice, barley and
other food grains, gold, animals and women. Nothing can satisfy
him.

PURPORT

Improvement of one’s economic condition is the aim and object of a
materialist, but there is no end to this material advancement, for if one
cannot control his lusty desires, he will never be pleased, even if he gets
all the material wealth of the world. In this age we see much material im-
provement, but still people are struggling to get more and more material
opulence. Manah sasthanindriyani prakrti-sthani karsati. Although
every living entity is a part of the Supreme Being, because of lusty
desires one continuously struggles for so-called betterment of one’s

economic condition. To have a satisfied mind, one must give up his heart
disease of lusty desires. This can be done only when one is Krsna
conscious.

TRANSLATION

When a man is nonenvious and does not desire ill fortune for
anyone, he is equipoised. For such a person, all directions appear

PURPORT

Prabodhananda Sarasvati said, viSvam parna-sukhayate: when one
becomes Krsna conscious by the mercy of Lord Caitanya, for him the en-
tire world appears happy, and he has nothing for which to hanker. On
the brahma-bhiita stage, or the platform of spiritual realization, there is
no lamentation and no material hankering (na socati na kanksati). As
long as one lives in the material world, actions and reactions will con-
tinue, but when one is unaffected by such material actions and reactions,
he is to be considered free from the danger of being victimized by
material desires. The symptoms of those who are satiated with lusty
desires are described in this verse. As explained by Srila Visvanatha
Cakravarti Thakura, when one is not envious even of his enemy, does


--- Page 74 ---
70 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 19
not expect honor from anyone, but instead desires all well-being even for
his enemy, he is understood to be a paramaharmsa, one who has fully
subdued the lusty desires for sense gratification.

TRANSLATION
For those who are too attached to material enjoyment, sense
gratification is very difficult to give up. Even when one is an in-
valid because of old age, one cannot give up such desires for sense
gratification. Therefore, one who actually desires happiness must
give up such unsatisfied desires, which are the cause of all
tribulations.
PURPORT
We have actually seen, especially in the Western countries, that men
who have reached more than eighty years of age still go to nightclubs and
pay heavy fees to drink wine and associate with women. Although such
men are too old to enjoy anything, their desires have not ceased. Time
deteriorates even the body itself, which is the medium for all sensual
satisfaction, but even when a man becomes old and invalid, his desires


--- Page 75 ---
Text 17] King Yayati Achieves Liberation 71
are strong enough to dictate that he go here and there to satisfy the
desires of his senses. Therefore, by the practice of bhakti-yoga, one
should give up his lusty desires. As explained by Sri Yamunacarya:
yadavadhi mama cetah krsna-padaravinde
nava-nava-rasa-dhamany udyatari rantum dasit
tadavadhi bata nari-sangame smaryamane
bhavati mukha-vikdarah susthu-nisthivanam ca
When one is Krsna conscious, he gets more and more happiness by dis-
charging duties for Krsna. Such a person spits on sense gratification,
especially that of sexual enjoyment. An experienced, advanced devotee is
no longer interested in sex life. The strong desire for sex can be subdued
only by advancement in Krsna consciousness.

--- Page 76 ---
72 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 19
PURPORT

Learning the etiquette of how to deal with women does not free one
from sexual attraction. As specifically mentioned herewith, such attrac-
tion is possible even with one’s mother, sister or daughter. Generally, of
course, one is not sexually attracted to his mother, sister or daughter, but
if one allows himself to sit very close to such a woman, one may be at-
tracted. This is a psychological fact. It may be said that one is liable to be
attracted if he is not very advanced in civilized life; however, as
specifically mentioned here, vidvarnsam api karsati: even if one is highly
advanced, materially or spiritually, he may be attracted by lusty desires.
The object of attraction may even be one’s mother, sister or daughter.
Therefore, one should be extremely careful in dealings with women. Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu was most strict in such dealings, especially after
He accepted the sannyasa order. Indeed, no woman could come near Him
to offer Him respect. Again, one is warned herewith that one should be
extremely careful in dealings with women. A brahmacari is forbidden
even to see the wife of his spiritual master if she happens to be young.
The wife of the spiritual master may sometimes take some service from
the disciple of her husband, as she would from a son, but if the wife of
the spiritual master is young, a brahmacari is forbidden to render
service to her.

To go to the forest and live there with the animals, meditating upon
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the only means by which to give
up lusty desires. Unless one gives up such desires, one’s mind cannot be


--- Page 78 ---
74 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 19
freed from material contamination. Therefore, if one is at all interested
in being freed from the bondage of repeated birth, death, old age and
disease, after a certain age one must go to the forest. Paiicasordhvarn
vanari vrajet. After fifty years of age, one should voluntarily give up
family life and go to the forest. The best forest is Vrndavana, where one
need not live with the animals but can associate with the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead, who never leaves Vrndavana. Cultivating Krsna
consciousness in Vrndavana is the best means of being liberated from
material bondage, for in Vrndavana one can automatically meditate upon
Krsna. Vrndavana has many temples, and in one or more of these tem-
ples one may see the form of the Supreme Lord as Radhi-Krsna or
Krsna-Balarama and meditate upon this form. As expressed here by the
words brahmany adhyaya, one should concentrate one’s mind upon the
Supreme Lord, Parabrahman. This Parabrahman is Krsna, as confirmed *
by Arjuna in Bhagavad-gita (param brahma param dhama pavitram
paramar bhavan). Krsna and His abode, Vrndavana, are not different.
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu said, aradhyo bhagavan vrajesa-tanayas tad-
dhama vrndavanam. Vrndavana is as good as Krsna. Therefore, if one
somehow or other gets the opportunity to live in Vrndavana, and if one is
not a pretender but simply lives in Vrndavana and concentrates his mind
upon Krsna, one is liberated from material bondage. One’s mind is not
purified, however, even in Vrndavana, if one is agitated by lusty desires.
One should not live in Vrndivana and commit offenses, for a life of
offenses in Vrndavana is no better than the lives of the monkeys and
hogs there. Many monkeys and hogs live in Vrndavana, and they are
concerned with their sexual desires. Men who have gone to Vrndavana
but who still hanker for sex should immediately leave Vrndavana and
stop their grievous offenses at the lotus feet of the Lord. There are many
misguided men who live in Vrndavana to satisfy their sexual desires, but
they are certainly no better than the monkeys and hogs. Those who are
under the control of mayd, and specifically under the control of lusty
desires, are called maya-mrga. Indeed, everyone in the conditional stage
of material life is a maya-mrga. It is said, maya-mrgarm dayitayepsitam
anvadhavad: Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu took sannyasa to show His
causeless mercy to the maya-mrgas, the people of this material world,
who suffer because of lusty desires. One should follow the principles of
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and always think of Krsna in full Krsna con-

will be successful.

One who knows that material happiness, whether good or bad,
in this life or in the next, on this planet or on the heavenly planets,
is temporary and useless, and that an intelligent person should not

Such a self-realized person knows quite well that material happi-
ness is the very cause of continued material existence and forget-
fulness of one’s own constitutional position.

The living entity is a spiritual soul, and the material body is his en-

cagement. This is the beginning of spiritual understanding.

‘“As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to
youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. The
self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change.” (Bg. 2.13) The
real mission of human life is to get free from encagement in the material
body. Therefore Krsna descends to teach the conditioned soul about
spiritual realization and how to become free from material bondage.
Yada yada hi dharmasya glanir bhavati bharata. The words dharmasya
glanih mean “pollution of one’s existence.” Our existence is now
polluted, and it must be purified (sattvari suddhyet). The human life is
meant for this purification, not for thinking of happiness in terms of the
external body, which is the cause of material bondage. Therefore, in this
verse, Maharaja Yayati advises that whatever material happiness we see
and whatever is promised for enjoyment is all merely flickering and tem-
porary. Abrahma-bhuvandl lokih punar avartino ’rjuna. Even if one is

must return to this planet earth and continue in the miserable condition
of material existence (bhitva bhiitva praliyate). One should always keep
this understanding in mind so as not to be allured by any kind of sense
enjoyment, in this life or in the next. One who is fully aware of this truth
is self-realized (sa atma-drk), but aside from him, everyone suffers in
the cycle of birth and death (mrtyu-samsara-vartmani). This under-
standing is one of true intelligence, and anything contrary to this is but a
cause of unhappiness. Krsna-bhakta—niskama, ataeva ‘Santa.’ Only a
Krsna conscious person, who knows the aim and object of life, is
peaceful. All others, whether karmis, 1777075 or yogis, are restless and
cannot enjoy real peace.

TRANSLATION

Having enjoyed sense gratification for many, many years, O
King Pariksit, Yayati was accustomed to it, but he gave it up en-
tirely in a moment, just as a bird flies away from the nest as soon as
its wings have grown.

PURPORT

That Maharaja Yayati was immediately liberated from the bondage of
conditioned life is certainly astonishing. But the example given herewith
is appropriate. A tiny baby bird, dependent fully on its father and
mother even to eat, suddenly flies away from the nest when its wings
have grown. Similarly, if one fully surrenders to the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead, one is immediately liberated from the bondage of
conditioned life, as promised by the Lord Himself (ahara tam sarva-
papebhyo moksayisyami). As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (2.4.18):

kirata-hanandhra-pulinda-pulkasa
abhira-sumbha yavanah khasadayah
ye ‘nye ca papa yad-apasrayasrayah
Sudhyanti tasmai prabhavisnave namah

“Kirata, Hina, Andhra, Pulinda, Pulkasa, Abhira, Sumbha, Yavana and
the Khasa races and even others addicted to sinful acts can be purified by
taking shelter of the devotees of the Lord, for He is the supreme power. I
beg to offer my respectful obeisances unto Him.” Lord Visnu is so
powerful that He can deliver anyone at once if He is pleased to do so. And
Lord Visnu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, can be pleased
immediately if we accept His order by surrendering unto Him, as
Maharaja Yayati did. Maharaja Yayati was eager to serve Vasudeva,
Krsna, and therefore as soon as he wanted to renounce material life, Lord
Vasudeva helped him. We must therefore be very sincere in surrender-
ing ourselves unto the lotus feet of the Lord. Then we can immediately


--- Page 84 ---
80 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 19
be liberated from all the bondage of conditioned life. This is clearly ex-
pressed in the next verse.

TRANSLATION
Because King Yayati completely surrendered unto the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Vasudeva, he was freed from all con-
tamination of the material modes of nature. Because of his self-
realization, he was able to fix his mind upon the Transcendence
[Parabrahman, Vasudeva], and thus he ultimately achieved the
position of an associate of the Lord.
PURPORT
The word vidhuta, meaning ‘‘cleansed,” is very significant. Everyone
in this material world is contaminated (karanarh guna-sango ’sya).


--- Page 85 ---
Text 26] King Yayati Achieves Liberation 81
Because we are in a material condition, we are contaminated either by
sattva-guna, by rajo-guna or by tamo-guna. Even if one becomes a
qualified brahmana in the mode of goodness (sattva-guna), he is still
materially contaminated. One must come to the platform of suddha-
sattva, transcending the sattva-guna. Then one is vidhuta-trilinga,
cleansed of the contamination caused by the three modes of material
nature. This is possible by the mercy of Krsna. As stated in Srimad-
Bhagavatam (1.2.17):
Srnvatam sva-kathah krsnah
punya-$ravana-kirtanah
hrdy antah-stho hy abhadrani
vidhunoti suhrt-satam
“Sri Krsna, the Personality of Godhead, who is the Paramatma
[Supersoul] in everyone’s heart and the benefactor of the truthful
devotee, cleanses desire for material enjoyment from the heart of the
devotee who has developed the urge to hear His messages, which are in
themselves virtuous when properly heard and chanted.”” A person trying
to be perfectly Krsna conscious by hearing the words of Krsna from
Srimad-Bhagavatam or Bhagavad-gita certainly has all the dirty things
cleansed from the core of his heart. Caitanya Mahaprabhu also says, ceto-
darpana-marjanam: the process of hearing and chanting the glories of
the Supreme Lord washes away the dirty things accumulated in the core
of the heart. As soon as one is freed from all the dirt of material con-
tamination, as Maharaja Yayati was, one’s original position as an associate
of the Lord is revealed. This is called svaripa-siddhi, or personal
perfection.

tween the husband and wife; sneha-vaiklavyat—from an exchange of
love and affection; parihasam—a funny joke or story; iva—like;

TRANSLATION
When Devayani heard Maharaja Yayati’s story of the he-goat and
she-goat, she understood that this story, which was presented as if
a funny joke for entertainment between husband and wife, was in-
tended to awaken her to her constitutional position.
PURPORT
When one actually awakens from material life, one understands his
real position as an eternal servant of Krsna. This is called liberation.
Muktir  hitvanyatha rapam 5৮07010600৫ vyavasthitih (Bhag. 2.10.6).
Under the influence of maya, everyone living in this material world
thinks that he is the master of everything (ahankara-vimadhatma
kartaham iti manyate). One thinks that there is no God or controller and
that one is independent and can do anything. This is the material condi-
tion, and when one awakens from this ignorance, he is called liberated.
Maharaja Yayati had delivered Devayani from the well, and finally, as a
dutiful husband, he instructed her with the story about the he-goat and
she-goat and thus delivered her from the misconception of material hap-
piness. Devayani was quite competent to understand her liberated hus-
band, and therefore she decided to follow him as his.faithful wife.

TRANSLATION
Thereafter, Devayani, the daughter of Sukracarya, understood
that the materialistic association of husband, friends and relatives
is like the association in a hotel full of tourists. The relationships
of society, friendship and love are created by the maya of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, exactly as in a dream. By the
grace of Krsna, Devayani gave up her imaginary position in the
material world. Completely fixing her mind upon Krsna, she
achieved liberation from the gross and subtle bodies.
PURPORT
One should be convinced that he is a spirit soul, part and parcel of the
Supreme Brahman, Krsna, but has somehow or other been entrapped by


--- Page 88 ---
84 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 19
the material coverings of the gross and subtle bodies, consisting of earth,
water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego. One should know
that the association of society, friendship, love, nationalism, religion and
so on are nothing but creations of maya. One’s only business is to become
Krsna conscious and render service unto Krsna as extensively as possible
for a living being. In this way one is liberated from material bondage. By
the grace of Krsna, Devayani attained this state through the instructions
of her husband.

Supersoul in everyone’s heart and are smaller than the smallest,
yet You are greater than the greatest and are all-pervading. You ap-
pear completely silent, having nothing to do, but this is due to
Your all-pervading nature and Your fullness in all opulences. I
therefore offer my respectful obeisances unto You.
PURPORT
How Devayani became self-realized by the grace of her great husband,
Maharaja Yayati, is described here. Describing such realization is another
way of performing the bhakti process.


--- Page 89 ---
Text 29] King Yayati Achieves Liberation 85
Sravanam kirtanam visnoh
smaranarh pada-sevanam
arcana vandanari dasyari
sakhyam atma-nivedanam

“Hearing and chanting about the transcendental holy name, form,
qualities, paraphernalia and pastimes of Lord Visnu, remembering them,
serving the lotus feet of the Lord, offering the Lord respectful worship,
offering prayers to the Lord, becoming His servant, considering the Lord
one’s best friend, and surrendering everything unto Him —these nine
processes are accepted as pure devotional service.” (Bhag. 7.5.23)
Sravanani kirtanam, hearing and chanting, are especially important. By
hearing from her husband about the greatness of Lord Vasudeva,
Devayani certainly became convinced and surrendered herself unto the
lotus feet of the Lord (om namo bhagavate vasudevdya). This is
knowledge. Bahiinam janmanam ante jianavan mar prapadyate. Sur-
render to Vasudeva is the result of hearing about Him for many, many
births. As soon as one surrenders unto Vasudeva, one is liberated im-
mediately. Because of her association with her great husband, Maharaja
Yayati, Devayani became purified, adopted the means of bhakti-yoga,
and thus became liberated.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Nineteenth
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “King Yaydti Achieves
Liberation.”

CHAPTER TWENTY
The Dynasty of Paru

This chapter describes the history of Paru and his descendant
Dusmanta. The son of Piru was Janamejaya, and his son was Pracinvan.
The sons and grandsons in the line of Pracinvan, one after another, were
Pravira, Manusyu, Carupada, Sudyu, Bahugava, Sarhyati, Aharhyati and
Raudrasva. Raudrasva had ten sons—Rteyu, Kakseyu, Sthandileyu,
Krteyuka, Jaleyu, Sannateyu, Dharmeyu, Satyeyu, Vrateyu and Vaneyu.
The son of Rteyu was Rantinava, who had three sons—Sumati, Dhruva
and Apratiratha. The son of Apratiratha was Kanva, and Kanva’s son was
Medhatithi. The sons of Medhatithi, headed by Praskanna, were all
brahmanas. The son of Rantiniva named Sumati had a son named Rebhi,
and his son was Dusmanta.

While hunting in the forest, Dusmanta once approached the asrama of
Maharsi Kanva, where he saw an extremely beautiful woman and became
attracted to her. That woman was the daughter of Visvamitra, and her
name was Sakuntala. Her mother was Menaka, who had left her in the
forest, where Kanva Muni found her. Kanva Muni brought her to his
asrama, where he raised and maintained her. When Sakuntala accepted
Maharaja Dusmanta as her husband, he married her according to the
gandharva-vidhi. Sakuritala later became pregnant by her husband, who
left her in the asrama of Kanva Muni and returned to his kingdom.

In due course of time, Sakuntala gave birth to a Vaisnava son, but
Dusmanta, having returned to the capital, forgot what had taken place.
Therefore, when Sakuntala approached him with her newly born child,
Maharaja Dusmanta refused to accept them as his wife and son. Later,
however, after a mysterious omen, the King accepted them. After
Maharaja Dusmanta’s death, Bharata, the son of Sakuntala, was en-
throned. He performed many great sacrifices, in which he gave great
riches in charity to the brahmanas. This chapter ends by describing the
birth of Bharadvaja and how Maharaja Bharata accepted Bharadvaja as
his son.

PURPORT
There are many historical instances by which we can understand that
from ksatriyas many brahmanas have been born and that from
brahmanas many ksatriyas have been born. The Lord Himself says in
Bhagavad-gita (4.13), catur-varnyarn maya 5507 guna-karma-
vibhagasah: “According to the three modes of material nature and the
work ascribed to them, the four divisions of human society were created
by Me.” Therefore, regardless of the family in which one takes birth,
when one is qualified with the symptoms of a particular section, he is to
be described accordingly. Yal-laksanarm proktam. One’s place in the

TRANSLATION

Once when King Dusmanta went to the forest to hunt and was
very much fatigued, he approached the residence of Kanva Muni.
There he saw a most beautiful woman who looked exactly like the
goddess of fortune and who sat there illuminating the entire
asrama by her effulgence. The King was naturally attracted by her
beauty, and therefore he approached her, accompanied by some of
his soldiers, and spoke to her.

TRANSLATION

King Dusmanta replied: O Sakuntala, with beautiful eyebrows,
you have taken your birth in the family of the great saint
Visvamitra, and your reception is quite worthy of your family.
Aside from this, the daughters of a king generally select their own
husbands.

PURPORT

In her reception of Maharaja Dusmanta, Sakuntala clearly said, “Your
Majesty may stay here, and you may accept whatever reception I can
offer.” Thus she indicated that she wanted Maharaja Dusmanta as her
husband. As far as Maharaja Dusmanta was concerned, he desired
Sakuntala as his wife from the very beginning, as soon as he saw her, so
the agreement to unite as husband and wife was natural. To induce
Sakuntala to accept the marriage, Maharija Dusmanta reminded her that
as the daughter of a king she could select her husband in an open assem-
bly. In the history of Aryan civilization there have been many instances
in which famous princesses have selected their husbands in open com-
petitions. For example, it was in such a competition that Sitidevi ac-
cepted Lord Ramacandra as her husband and that Draupadi accepted
Arjuna, and there are many other instances. So marriage by agreement
or by selecting one’s own husband in an open competition is allowed.
There are eight kinds of marriage, of which marriage by agreement is
called gandharva marriage. Generally the parents select the husband or
wife for their daughter or son, but gandharva marriage takes place by
personal selection. Still, although marriage by personal selection or by
agreement took place in the past, we find no such thing as divorce by dis-
agreement. Of course, divorce by disagreement took place among low-
class men, but marriage by agreement was found even in the very


--- Page 101 ---
98 Srimad -Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 20
highest classes, especially in the royal ksatriya families. Maharaja
Dusmanta’s acceptance of Sakuntala as his wife was sanctioned by Vedic
culture. How the marriage took place is described in the next verse.

TRANSLATION
When Sakuntala responded to Maharaja Dusmanta’s proposal
with silence, the agreement was complete. Then the King, who
knew the laws of marriage, immediately married her by chanting
the Vedic pranava [orikira], in accordance with the marriage
ceremony as performed among the Gandharvas.
PURPORT
The 07070, pranava, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead repre-
sented by letters. Bhagavad-gita says that the letters a-u-m, combined
together as 077, represent the Supreme Lord. Religious principles are
meant to invoke the blessings and mercy of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Krsna, who says in Bhagavad-gita that He is personally pres-

ent in sexual desires that are not contrary to religious principles. The
word vidhina means, “according to religious principles.” The association
of men and women according to religious principles is allowed in the
Vedic culture. In our Krsna consciousness movement we allow marriage
on the basis of religious principles, but the sexual combination of men
and women as friends is irreligious and is not allowed.

the citizens, he at first declined to accept them. Sakuntala, however, was
so chaste that an omen from the sky declared the truth so that others
could hear. When everyone heard from the omen that Sakuntala and her
child were truly the King’s wife and son, the King gladly accepted them.

TRANSLATION

The voice said: O Maharaja Dusmanta, a son actually belongs to
his father, whereas the mother is only a container, like the skin of
a bellows. According to Vedic injunctions, the father is born as the
son. Therefore, maintain your own son and do not insult
Sakuntala.

PURPORT

According to the Vedic injunction atma vai putra-namadsi, the father
becomes the son. The mother is simply like a storekeeper, because the
seed of the child is placed in her womb, but it is the father who is respon-
sible for maintaining the son. In Bhagavad-gita the Lord says that He is
the seed-giving father of all living entities (aha byja-pradah pitd), and
therefore He is responsible for maintaining them. This is also confirmed
in the Vedas. Eko bahunar yo vidadhati kaman: although God is one,
He maintains all living entities with their necessities for life. The living
entities in different forms are sons of the Lord, and therefore the father,
the Supreme Lord, supplies them food according to their different
bodies. The small ant is supplied a grain of sugar, and the elephant is
supplied tons of food, but everyone is able to eat. Therefore there is no
question of overpopulation. Because the father, Krsna, is fully opulent,
there is no scarcity of food, and because there is no scarcity, the
propaganda of overpopulation is only a myth. Actually one suffers for
want of food when material nature, under the order of the father,
refuses to supply him food. It is the living entity’s position that deter-
mines whether food will be supplied or not. When a diseased person is
forbidden to eat, this does not mean that there is a scarcity of food;


--- Page 106 ---
Text 22] The Dynasty of Piru 103
rather, the diseased person requires the treatment of not being supplied
with food. In Bhagavad-gita (7.10) the Lord also says, bijarh mar sarva-
bhutanam: “I am the seed of all living entities.” A particular type of
seed is sown within the earth, and then a particular type of tree or plant
comes out. The mother resembles the earth, and when a particular type
of seed is sown by the father, a particular type of body takes birth.

--- Page 107 ---
104 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 20
tasmat putra iti proktah
svayam eva svayambhuva
Because a son delivers his father from punishment in the hell called put,
the son is called putra. According to this principle, when there is a dis-
agreement between the father and mother, it is the father, not the
mother, who is delivered by the son. But if the wife is faithful and firmly
adherent to her husband, when the father is delivered the mother is also
delivered. Consequently, there is no such thing as divorce in the Vedic
literature. A wife is always trained to be chaste and faithful to her hus-
band, for this helps her achieve deliverance from any abominable
material condition. This verse clearly says, putro nayati naradeva yama-
ksayat: “The son saves his father from the custody of Yamaraja.” It
never says, putro nayati mataram: “The son saves his mother.” The
seed-giving father is delivered, not the storekeeper mother. Conse-
quently, husband and wife should not separate under any condition, for
if they have a child whom they raise to be a Vaisnava, he can save both
the father and mother from the custody of Yamaraja and punishment in
hellish life.

Maharaja Bharata, the son of Dusmanta, had the mark of Lord

Personality of Godhead with a grand ritualistic ceremony, he be-
came the emperor and master of the entire world. Then, under the
priesthood of Mamateya, Bhrgu Muni, he performed fifty-five
horse sacrifices on the bank of the Ganges, beginning from its
mouth and ending at its source, and seventy-eight horse sacrifices

Text 26] The Dynasty of Paru 107
on the bank of the Yamuna, beginning from the confluence at
Prayaga and ending at the source. He established the sacrificial fire
on an excellent site, and he distributed great wealth to the
brahmanas. Indeed, he distributed so many cows that each of thou-
sands of brahmanas had one badva [13,084] as his share.
PURPORT

As indicated here by the words dausmanter agnih saci-gune citah,
Bharata, the son of Maharaja Dusmanta, arranged for many ritualistic
ceremonies all over the world, especially all over India on the banks of
the Ganges and Yamuna, from the mouth to the source, and all such
sacrifices were performed in very distinguished places. As stated in
Bhagavad-gita (3.9), yajrarthat karmano ’nyatra loko ‘yar karma-
bandhanah: “Work done as a sacrifice for Visnu has to be performed,
otherwise work binds one to this material world.” Everyone should
engage in the performance of yajiia, and the sacrificial fire should be ig-
nited everywhere, the entire purpose being to make people happy,
prosperous and progressive in spiritual life. Of course, these things were
possible before the beginning of Kali-yuga because there were qualified
brahmanas who could perform such yajfias. For the present, however,
the Brahma-vaivarta Purana enjoins:

asvamedhar gavalambhari
sannydasam pala-paitrkam
devarena sutotpattirn
kalau parica vivarjayet

“In this age of Kali, five acts are forbidden: offering a horse in sacrifice,
offering a cow in sacrifice, accepting the order of sannyasa, offering
oblations of flesh to the forefathers, and begetting children in the wife of
one’s brother.” In this age, such yajiias as the asvamedha-yajiia and
gomedha-yajiia are impossible to perform because there are neither
sufficient riches nor qualified brahmanas. This verse says, mamateyari
purodhdya: Maharaja Bharata engaged the son of Mamata, Bhrgu Muni,
to take charge of performing this yajiia. Now, however, such brahmanas
are impossible to find. Therefore the S$astras recommend, yajiaih
sankirtana-prayair yajanti hi sumedhasah: those who are intelligent


--- Page 111 ---
108 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 20
should perform the sarkirtana-yajiia inaugurated by Lord Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu.
krsna-varnarh tvisakrsnam
sangopangastra-parsadam
yajAaih sankirtana-prayair
yajanti hi sumedhasah
“In this age of Kali, people endowed with sufficient intelligence will wor-
ship the Lord, who is accompanied by His associates, by performance of
sankirtana-yajia.” (Bhag. 11.5.32) Yajia must be performed, for
otherwise people will be entangled in sinful activities and will suffer im-
mensely. Therefore the Krsna consciousness movement has taken charge
of introducing the chanting of Hare Krsna all over the world. This Hare
Krsna movement is also yajiia, but without the difficulties involved in
securing paraphernalia and qualified brahmanas. This congregational
chanting can be performed anywhere and everywhere. If people some-
how or other assemble together and are induced to chant Hare Krsna,
Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama
Rama, Hare Hare, all the purposes of yajia will be fulfilled. The first
purpose is that there must be sufficient rain, for without rain there can-
not be any produce (annad bhavanti bhitani parjanyad anna-
sambhavah). All our necessities can be produced simply by rainfall
(kamari vavarsa parjanyah), and the earth is the original source of all
necessities (sarva-kama-dugha mahi). In conclusion, therefore, in this
age of Kali people all over the world should refrain from the four prin-
ciples of sinful life—illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gam-
bling—and in a pure state of existence should perform the simple yajiia
of chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra. Then the earth will certainly
produce all the necessities for life, and people will be happy
economically, politically, socially, religiously and culturally. Everything
will be in proper order.

TRANSLATION
Bharata, the son of Maharaja Dusmanta, bound thirty-three
hundred horses for those sacrifices, and thus he astonished all
other kings. He surpassed even the opulence of the demigods, for
he achieved the supreme spiritual master, Hari.
PURPORT
One who achieves the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of God-
head certainly surpasses all material wealth, even that of the demigods in
the heavenly planets. Yar labdhva caparam labharih manyate nadhikarm
tatah. The achievement of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead is the most exalted achievement in life.

As the ruler of the entire universe, Emperor Bharata had the
opulences of a great kingdom and unconquerable soldiers. His
sons and family had seemed to him to be his entire life. But finally
he thought of all this as an impediment to spiritual advancement,
and therefore he ceased from enjoying it.
PURPORT
Maharaja Bharata had incomparable opulence in sovereignty, soldiers,
sons, daughters and everything for material enjoyment, but when he
realized that all such material opulences were useless for spiritual ad-
vancement, he retired from material enjoyment. The Vedic civilization
enjoins that after a certain age, following in the footsteps of Maharaja
Bharata, one should cease to enjoy material opulences and should take
the order of vanaprastha.

the womb of Mamata.
PURPORT
The sex impulse is so strong in this material world that even
Brhaspati, who is supposed to be the priest of the demigods and a very
learned scholar, wanted to have a sexual relationship with his brother’s
pregnant wife. This can happen even in the society of the higher
demigods, so what to speak of human society? The sex impulse is so
strong that it can agitate even a learned personality like Brhaspati.

TRANSLATION

Mamata very much feared being forsaken by her husband for
giving birth to an illegitimate son, and therefore she considered
giving up the child. But then the demigods solved the problem by
enunciating a name for the child.

PURPORT

According to Vedic scripture, whenever a child is born there are some
ceremonies known as jata-karma and nama-karana, in which learned
brahmanas, immediately after the birth of the child, make a horoscope
according to astrological calculations. But the child to which Mamata gave
birth was begotten by Brhaspati irreligiously, for although Mamata was
the wife of Utathya, Brhaspati made her pregnant by force. Therefore
Brhaspati became bharta. According to Vedic culture, a wife is con-
sidered the property of her husband, and a son born by illicit sex is called
dvdja. The common word still current in Hindu society for such a son is
dogla, which refers to a son not begotten by the husband of his mother.
In such a situation, it is difficult to give the child a name according to
proper regulative principles. Mamata, therefore, was perplexed, but the
demigods gave the child the appropriate name Bharadvaja, which indi-
cated that the child born illegitimately should be maintained by both
Mamata and Brhaspati.

Brhaspati said to Mamata, “You foolish woman, although this
child was born from the wife of one man through the semen dis-
charged by another, you should maintain him.” Upon hearing
this, Mamata replied, “0 Brhaspati, you maintain him!*’ After
speaking in this way, Brhaspati and Mamata both left. Thus the
child was known as Bharadvaja.

TRANSLATION

Although encouraged by the demigods to maintain the child,
Mamata considered him useless because of his illicit birth, and
therefore she left him. Consequently, the demigods known as the
Maruts maintained the child, and when Maharaja Bharata was dis-
appointed for want of a child, this child was given to him as his
son.

PURPORT

From this verse it is understood that those who are rejected from the
higher planetary system are given a chance to take birth in the most
exalted families on this planet earth.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Twentieth
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “The Dynasty of Piru.”


--- Page 122 ---
CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
The Dynasty of Bharata
This Twenty-first Chapter describes the dynasty born from Maharaja
Bharata, the son of Maharaja Dusmanta, and it also describes the glories
of Rantideva, Ajamidha and others.

The son of Bharadvaja was Manyu, and Manyu’s sons were
Brhatksatra, Jaya, Mahavirya, Nara and Garga. Of these five, Nara had a
son named Sankrti, who had two sons, named Guru and Rantideva. As an
exalted devotee, Rantideva saw every living entity in relationship with
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore he completely
engaged his mind, his words and his very self in the service of the
Supreme Lord and His devotees. Rantideva was so exalted that he would
sometimes give away his own food in charity, and he and his family
would fast. Once, after Rantideva spent forty-eight days fasting, not even
drinking water, excellent food made with ghee was brought to him, but
when he was about to eat it a brahmana guest appeared. Rantideva,
therefore, did not eat the food, but instead immediately offered a portion
of it to the brahmana. When the brahmana left and Rantideva was just
about to eat the remnants of the food, a Sidra appeared. Rantideva
therefore divided the remnants between the Sidra and himself. Again,
when he was just about to eat the remnants of the food, another guest ap-
peared. Rantideva therefore gave the rest of the food to the new guest
and was about to content himself with drinking the water to quench his
thirst, but this also was precluded, for a thirsty guest came and
Rantideva gave him the water. This was all ordained by the Supreme
Personality of Godhead just to glorify His devotee and show how tolerant
a devotee is in rendering service to the Lord. The Supreme Personality of
Godhead, being extremely pleased with Rantideva, entrusted him with
very confidential service. The special power to render the most confiden-
tial service is entrusted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead to a pure
devotee, not to ordinary devotees. | |

Garga, the son of Bharadvaja, had a son named Sini, and Sini’s son was
Gargya. Although Gargya was a ksatriya by birth, his sons became

119


--- Page 123 ---
120 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 21
brahmanas. The son of Mahavirya was Duritaksaya, whose sons were
Trayyaruni, Kavi and Puskararuni. Although these three sons were born
of a ksatriya king, they also achieved the position of brahmanas. The son
of Brhatksatra constructed the city of Hastinapura and was known as
Hasti. His sons were Ajamidha, Dvimidha and Purumidha.

From Ajamidha came Priyamedha and other brahmanas and also a son
named Brhadisu. The sons, grandsons and further descendants of
Brhadisu were Brhaddhanu, Brhatkaya, Jayadratha, 16803 and Syenajit.
From Syenajit came four sons —Ruciraéva, Drdhahanu, Kasya and Vatsa.
From Rucirasva came a son named Para, whose sons were Prthusena and
Nipa, and from Nipa came one hundred sons. Another son of Nipa was
Brahmadatta. From Brahmadatta came Visvaksena; from Visvaksena,
Udaksena; and from Udaksena, Bhallata.

The son of Dvimidha was Yavinara, and from Yavinara came many
sons and grandsons, such 85 Krtiman, Satyadhrti, Drdhanemi, Suparsva,
Sumati, Sannatiman, Krti, Nipa, Udgrayudha, Ksemya, Suvira,
Ripuiijaya and Bahuratha. Purumidha had no sons, but Ajamidha, in ad-
dition to his other sons, had a son named Nila, whose son was Santi. The
descendants of Santi were Suéanti, Puruja, Arka and Bharmyasva.
Bharmyaéva had five sons, one of whom, Mudgala, begot a dynasty of
brahmanas. Mudgala had twins—a son, Divodasa, and a daughter,
Ahalya. From Ahalya, by her husband, Gautama, Satananda was born.
The son of Satananda was Satyadhrti, and his son was Saradvan.
Saradvin’s son was known as Krpa, and Saradvin’s daughter, known as
Krpi, became the wife of Dronacarya.

Rantideva never endeavored to earn anything. He would enjoy

guests came he would give them everything. Thus he underwent
considerable suffering, along with the members of his family. In-
deed, he and his family members shivered for want of food and
water, yet Rantideva always remained sober. Once, after fasting for
forty-eight days, in the morning Rantideva received some water
and some foodstuffs made with milk and ghee, but when he and
his family were about to eat, a brahmana guest arrived.

with faith and respect and gave him a share of the food. The
brahmana guest ate his share and then went away.
PURPORT

Rantideva perceived the presence of the Supreme Personality of God-
head in every living being, but he never thought that because the
Supreme Lord is present in every living being, every living being must
be God. Nor did he distinguish between one living being and another. He
perceived the presence of the Lord both in the brahmana and in the
candala. This is the true vision of equality, as confirmed by the Lord
Himself in Bhagavad-gita (5.18):

vidyd-vinaya-sampanne
brahmane gavi hastini
Suni caiva Sva-pake ca
panditah sama-darsinah
“The humble sage, by virtue of true knowledge, sees with equal vision a
learned and gentle brahmana, a cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater
[outcaste].” A pandita, or learned person, perceives the presence of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead in every living being. Therefore, al-
though it has now become fashionable to give preference to the so-called
daridra-ndarayana, or “poor Narayana,” Rantideva had no reason to give
preference to any one person. The idea that because Narayana is present
in the heart of one who is daridra, or poor, the poor man should be called
daridra-narayana is a wrong conception. By such logic, because the Lord
is present within the hearts of the dogs and hogs, the dogs and hogs
would also be Narayana. One should not mistakenly think that Rantideva
subscribed to this view. Rather, he saw everyone as part of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead (hari-sambandhi-vastunah). It is not that every-
one is the Supreme Godhead. Such a theory, which is propounded by the
Mayavada philosophy, is always misleading, and Rantideva would never
have accepted it.

TRANSLATION
Thereafter, having divided the remaining food with his rela-
tives, Rantideva was just about to eat his own share when a $udra
guest arrived. Seeing the &udra in relationship with the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, King Rantideva gave him also a share of
the food.
PURPORT
Because King Rantideva saw everyone as part of the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead, he never distinguished between the brahmana and
the Sidra, the poor and the rich. Such equal vision is called sama-
darsinah (panditah sama-darsinah). One who has actually realized that
the Supreme Personality of Godhead is situated in everyone’s heart and
that every living being is part of the Lord does not make any distinction
between the brahmana and the Sidra, the poor (daridra) and the rich
(dhani). Such a person sees all living beings equally and treats them
equally, without discrimination.

alone the King could save the life of anyone who might hear him.

PURPORT
Vasudeva Datta made a similar statement to Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu,
requesting the Lord to liberate all living entities in His presence.
Vasudeva Datta submitted that if they were unfit to be liberated, he him-
self would take all their sinful reactions and suffer personally so that the
Lord might deliver them. A Vaisnava is therefore described as being
para-duhkha-duhkhi, very much aggrieved by the sufferings of others.
As such, a Vaisnava engages in activities for the real welfare of human
society.

King Rantideva had no ambition to enjoy material benefits from

of Godhead, he fixed his mind at Lord Visnu’s lotus feet.

PURPORT
Srila Narottama dasa Thakura has sung:
anya devdsraya nai, tomare kahinu bhai,
ei bhakti parama karana
If one wants to become a pure devotee of the Supreme Lord, one should
not hanker to take benedictions from the demigods. As stated in
Bhagavad-gita (7.20), kamais tais tair hrta-jianah prapadyante 'nya-
devatah: those befooled by the illusion of the material energy worship
gods other than the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore, al-
though Rantideva was personally able to see Lord Brahma and Lord Siva,
he did not hanker to take material benefits from them. Rather, he fixed
his mind upon Lord Vasudeva and rendered devotional service unto
Him. This is the sign of a pure devotee, whose heart is not adulterated by
material desires.

Maharaja Pariksit; svapna-vat—like a dream; pratyaliyata—merged.
TRANSLATION
O Maharaja Pariksit, because King Rantideva was a pure devo-
tee, always Krsna conscious and free from all material desires, the
Lord’s illusory energy, maya, could not exhibit herself before
him. On the contrary, for him maya entirely vanished, exactly like
a dream.
PURPORT
As it is said:
krsna—sitrya-sama; maya haya andhakara
yahan krsna, tahan nahi mayara adhikara
Just as there is no chance that darkness can exist in the sunshine, in a
pure Krsna conscious person there can be no existence of maya. The
Lord Himself says in Bhagavad-gita (7.14):
daivi hy esa gunamayi
mama maya duratyaya
mam eva ye prapadyante
mayam eta taranti te
“This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material
nature, is difficult to overcome. But those who have surrendered unto Me
can easily cross beyond it.” If one wants to be free from the influence of
maya, the illusory energy, one must become Krsna conscious and always
keep Krsna prominent within the core of his heart. In Bhagavad-gita
(9.34) the Lord advises that one always think of Him (man-mana bhava
mad-bhakto mad-ydji mam namaskuru). In this way, by always being
Krsna-minded or Krsna conscious, one can surpass the influence of maya
(mayam etam taranti te). Because Rantideva was Krsna conscious, he
was not under the influence of the illusory energy. The word svapnavat


--- Page 137 ---
134 Srimad -Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 21
is significant in this connection. Because in the material world the mind
is absorbed in materialistic activities, when one is asleep many contradic-
tory activities appear in one’s dreams. When one awakens, however,
these activities automatically merge into the mind. Similarly, as long as
one is under the influence of the material energy he makes many plans
and schemes, but when one is Krsna conscious such dreamlike plans
automatically disappear.

TRANSLATION
All those who followed the principles of King Rantideva were
totally favored by his mercy and became pure devotees, attached to
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana. Thus they all
became the best of yogis.
PURPORT
The best yogis or mystics are the devotees, as confirmed by the Lord
Himself in Bhagavad-gita (6.47):

--- Page 138 ---
Text 20] The Dynasty of Bharata 135
sraddhavan bhajate yo mar
sa me yuktatamo matah
“Of all yogis, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping
Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in
yoga and is the highest of all.”” The best yogi is he who constantly thinks
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead within the core of the heart. Be-
cause Rantideva was the king, the chief executive in the state, all the
residents of the state became devotees of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Narayana, by the king’s transcendental association. This is the
influence of a pure devotee. If there is one pure devotee, his association
can create hundreds and thousands of pure devotees. Srila Bhaktivinoda
Thakura has said that a Vaispava is meritorious in proportion to the
number of devotees he has created. A Vaisnava becomes superior not
simply by jugglery of words but by the number of devotees he has cre-
ated for the Lord. Here the word rantidevanuvartinah indicates that
Rantideva’s officers, friends relatives and subjects all became first-class
Vaisnavas by his association. In other words, Rantideva is confirmed
herein to be a first-class devotee, or maha-bhagavata. Mahat-sevari
dvaram ahur vimukteh: one should render service to such mahatmads,
for then one will automatically achieve the goal of liberation. Srila
Narottama dasa Thakura has also said, chadiya vaisnava-seva nistara
payeche keba: one cannot be liberated by his own effort, but if one be-
comes subordinate to a pure Vaisnava, the door to liberation is open.

of Duritaksaya took birth in a dynasty of ksatriyas, they too at-

TRANSLATION

From King Hasti came three sons, named Ajamidha, Dvimidha
and Purumidha. The descendants of Ajamidha, headed by
Priyamedha, all achieved the position of brahmanas.

PURPORT

This verse gives evidence confirming the statement of Bhagavad-gita
that the orders of society— brahmana, ksatriya, vaiSya and Sudra—are
calculated in terms of qualities and activities (guna-karma-vibhagasah).
All the descendants of Ajamidha, who was a hsatriya, became
brahmanas. This was certainly because of their qualities and activities.
Similarly, sometimes the sons of brahmanas or ksatriyas become vaisyas
(brahmana vaisyatam gatah). When a ksatriya or brahmana adopts the
occupation or duty of a vaisya (krsi-goraksya-vanijyam), he is certainly
counted as a vaiSya. On the other hand, if one is born a vai§ya, by his ac-
tivities he can become a brahmana. This is confirmed by Narada Muni.
Yasya yal-laksanam proktam. The members of the varnas, or social or-
ders— brahmana, ksatriya, vaiSya and $iidra—must be ascertained by
their symptoms, not by birth. Birth is immaterial; quality is essential.

--- Page 143 ---
140 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 21
Vyasadeva, is described in great detail in the Brahma-vaivarta Purana.
There it is said that Vyasadeva maintained the daughter of Jabali as his
wife and that after they performed penances together for many years, he
placed his seed in her womb. The child remained in the womb of his
mother for twelve years, and when the father asked the son to come out,
the son replied that he would not come out unless he were completely
liberated from the influence of maya. Vyasadeva then assured the child
that he would not be influenced by maya, but the child did not believe
his father, for the father was still attached to his wife and children.
Vyasadeva then went to Dvaraka and informed the Personality of God-
head about his problem, and the Personality of Godhead, at Vyasadeva’s
request, went to Vyasadeva’s cottage, where He assured the child in the
womb that he would not be influenced by maya. Thus assured, the child
came out, but he immediately went away as a parivrajakacarya. When
the father, very much aggrieved, began to follow his saintly boy,
Sukadeva Gosvami, the boy created a duplicate Sukadeva, who later en-
tered family life. Therefore, the suka-kanya, or daughter of Sukadeva,
mentioned in this verse is the daughter of the duplicate or imitation
Sukadeva. The original Sukadeva was a lifelong brahmacari.

CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
The Descendants of Ajamidha
This chapter describes the descendants of Divodasa. It also describes
Jarasandha, who belonged to the Rksa dynasty, as well as Duryodhana,
Arjuna and others.

The son of Divodasa was Mitrayu, who had four sons, one after
another —Cyavana, Sudasa, Sahadeva and Somaka. Somaka had one
hundred sons, of whom the youngest was Prsata, from whom Drupada
was born. Drupada’s daughter was Draupadi, and his sons were headed
by Dhrstadyumna. Dhrstadyumna’s son was Dhrstaketu.

Another son of Ajamidha was named Rksa. From Rksa came a son
named Sarnvarana, and from Samvarana came Kuru, the king of
Kuruksetra. Kuru had four sons —Pariksi, Sudhanu, Jahnu and Nisadha.
Among the descendants in the dynasty from Sudhanu were Suhotra,
Cyavana, Krti and Uparicara Vasu. The sons of Uparicara Vasu, includ-
ing Brhadratha, Kusamba, Matsya, Pratyagra and Cedipa, became kings
of the Cedi state. In the dynasty from Brhadratha came Kuéagra, Rsabha,
Satyahita, Puspavan and Jahu, and from Brhadratha through the womb
of another wife came Jarasandha, who was followed by Sahadeva, Somapi
and Srutaérava. Pariksi, the son of Kuru, had no sons. Among the de-
scendants of Jahnu were Suratha, Vidiratha, Sarvabhauma, Jayasena,
Radhika, Ayutayu, Akrodhana, Devitithi, Rksa, Dilipa and Pratipa.

The sons of Pratipa were Devapi, Santanu and Bahlika. When Devapi
retired to the forest, his younger brother Santanu became the king. Al-
though Santanu, being younger, was not eligible to occupy the throne, he
disregarded his elder brother. Consequently, there was no rainfall for
twelve years. Following the advice of the brahmanas, Santanu was ready
to return the kingdom to Devipi, but by the intrigue of Sintanu’s
minister, Devapi became unfit to be king. Therefore Santanu resumed
charge of the kingdom, and rain fell properly during his regime. By
mystic power, Devapi still lives in the village known as Kalapa-grama.
In this Kali-yuga, when the descendants of Soma known as the
candra-vamsa (the lunar dynasty) die out, Devapi, at the beginning of

147

148 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 22
Satya-yuga, will reestablish the dynasty of the moon. The wife of San-
tanu named Ganga gave birth to Bhisma, one of the twelve authorities.
Two sons named Citrangada and Vicitravirya were also born from the
womb of Satyavati by the semen of Santanu, and Vyasadeva was born
from Satyavati by the semen of Parasara. Vyasadeva instructed the
history of the Bhagavatam to his son Sukadeva. Through the womb of
the two wives and the maidservant of Vicitravirya, Vyasadeva begot
Dhrtarastra, Pandu and Vidura.

Dhrtarastra had one hundred sons, headed by Duryodhana, and one
daughter named Duh$ala. Pandu had five sons, headed by Yudhisthira,
and each of these five sons had one son from Draupadi. The names of
these sons of Draupadi were Prativindhya, Srutasena, Srutakirti,
Satanika and Srutakarma. Besides these five sons, by other wives the
Pandavas had many other sons, such as Devaka, Ghatotkaca, Sarvagata,
Suhotra, Naramitra, Iravan, Babhruvahana and Abhimanyu. From
Abhimanyu, Maharaja Pariksit was born, and Maharaja Pariksit had four
sons—Janamejaya, Srutasena, Bhimasena and Ugrasena.

Next Sukadeva Gosvami described the future sons of the Pandu
family. From Janamejaya, he said, would come a son named Satanika,
and following in the dynasty would be Sahasranika, Aévamedhaja,
Asimakrsna, Nemicakra, Citraratha, Suciratha, Vrstimin, Susena,
Sunitha, Nrcaksu, Sukhinala, Pariplava, Sunaya, Medhavi, Nrpaijaya,
Dirva, Timi, Brhadratha, Sudasa, Satinika, Durdamana, Mahinara,
Dandapani, Nimi and Ksemaka.

Sukadeva Gosvami then predicted the kings of the magadha-varmsa,
or Magadha dynasty. Sahadeva, the son of Jarasandha, would beget
Marjari, and from him would come Srutasrava. Subsequently taking
birth in the dynasty will be Yutayu, Niramitra, Sunaksatra, Brhatsena,
Karmajit, Sutafijaya, Vipra, Suci, Ksema, Suvrata, Dharmasitra, Sama,
Dyumatsena, Sumati, Subala, Sunitha, Satyajit, Visvajit and Ripuiijaya.

Text 17] The Descendants of Ajamidha 157
TRANSLATION
Because the King was able to make everyone happy for sense
gratification, primarily by the touch of his hand, his name was
Santanu. Once, when there was no rainfall in the kingdom for
twelve years and the King consulted his learned brahminical ad-
visors, they said, “You are faulty for enjoying the property of your
elder brother. For the elevation of your kingdom and home, you
should return the kingdom to him.”
PURPORT
One cannot enjoy sovereignty or perform an agnihotra-yajiia in the
presence of one’s elder brother, or else one becomes a usurper, known as
parivetta.

TRANSLATION
When the brahmanas said this, Maharaja Santanu went to the
forest and requested his elder brother Devapi to take charge of the
kingdom, for it is the duty of a king to maintain his subjects. Pre-
viously, however, Santanu’s minister Asvavara had instigated some
brahmanas to induce Devapi to transgress the injunctions of the
Vedas and thus make himself unfit for the post of ruler. The
brahmanas deviated Devipi from the path of the Vedic principles,
and therefore when asked by Santanu he did not agree to accept
the post of ruler. On the contrary, he blasphemed the Vedic prin-
ciples and therefore became fallen. Under the circumstances,
Santanu again became the king, and Indra, being pleased,
showered rains. Devapi later took to the path of mystic yoga to
control his mind and senses and went to the village named Kalapa-
grama, where he is still living.

After the dynasty of the moon-god comes to an end in this age of

brother of Santanu] came a son named Somadatta, who had three
sons, named Bhiiri, Bhirisrava and Sala. From Santanu, through
the womb of his wife named Ganga, came Bhisma, the exalted,
self-realized devotee and learned scholar.

TRANSLATION

Bhismadeva was the foremost of all warriors. When he defeated
Lord Paraurama in a fight, Lord ParaSurama was very satisfied
with him. By the semen of Santanu in the womb of Satyavati, the
daughter of a fisherman, Citrangada took birth.

PURPORT

Satyavati was actually the daughter of Uparicara Vasu by the womb of
a fisherwoman known as Matsyagarbha. Later, Satyavati was raised by a
fisherman.

The fight between Parasurama and Bhismadeva concerns three
daughters of Kasiraja— Ambika, Ambalika and Amba —who were forc-
ibly abducted by Bhismadeva, acting on behalf of his brother
Vicitravirya. Amba thought that Bhismadeva would marry her and be-
came attached to him, but Bhismadeva refused to marry her, for he
had taken the vow of brahmacarya. Amba therefore approached
Bhismadeva’s military spiritual master, ParaSurama, who instructed
Bhisma to marry her. Bhismadeva refused, and therefore Parasurama
fought with him to force him to accept the marriage. But Parasurama
was defeated, and he was pleased with Bhisma.

TRANSLATION

Citrangada, of whom Vicitravirya was the younger brother, was
killed by a Gandharva who was also named Citrangada. Satyavati,
before her marriage to Santanu, gave birth to the master authority
of the Vedas, Vyasadeva, known as Krsna Dvaipayana, who was
begotten by Parasara Muni. From Vyasadeva, I [Sukadeva
Gosvami] was born, and from him I studied this great work of
literature, Srimad-Bhagavatam. The incarnation of Godhead
Vedavyasa, rejecting his disciples, headed by Paila, instructed
Srimad-Bhagavatam to me because I was free from all material
desires. After Ambika and Ambilika, the two daughters of
Kasiraja, were taken away by force, Vicitravirya married them, but
because he was too attached to these two wives, he had a heart at-
tack and died of tuberculosis.

Badarayana, Sri Vyasadeva, following the order of his mother,
Satyavati, begot three sons, two by the womb of Ambika and
Ambalika, the two wives of his brother Vicitravirya, and the third
by Vicitravirya’s maidservant. These sons were Dhrtarastra, Pandu
and Vidura.

PURPORT

Vicitravirya died of tuberculosis, and his wives, Ambika and
Ambalika, had no issue. Therefore, after Vicitravirya’s death, his
mother, Satyavati, who was also the mother of Vyasadeva, asked
Vyasadeva to beget children through the wives of Vicitravirya. In those
days, the brother of the husband could beget children through the womb
of his sister-in-law. This was known as devarena sutotpatti. If the hus-
band was somehow unable to beget children, his brother could do so
through the womb of his sister-in-law. This devarena sutotpatti and the
sacrifices of asvamedha and gomedha are forbidden in the age of Kali.

“In this age of Kali, five acts are forbidden: the offering of a horse in

sannyasa, the offering of oblations of flesh to the forefathers, and a
man’s begetting children in his brother’s wife.” (Brahma-vaivarta
Purana).

168 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 22
Five thousand years ago, therefore, when the Pandavas ruled, Manipura
existed, as did its king. Therefore this kingdom is a very old, aristocratic
Vaisnava kingdom. If this kingdom is organized as a Vaisnava state, this
revitalization will be a great success because for five thousand years this
state has maintained its identity. If the Vaisnava spirit is revived there, it
will be a wonderful place, renowned throughout the entire world.
Manipuri Vaisnavas are very famous in Vaisnava society. In Vrndavana
and Navadvipa there are many temples constructed by the king of
Manipura. Some of our devotees belong to the Manipura state. The Krsna
consciousness movement, therefore, can be well spread in the state of
Manipura by the cooperative efforts of the Krsna conscious devotees.

CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE
The Dynasties of the Sons of Yayati
In this Twenty-third Chapter the dynasties of Anu, Druhyu, Turvasu
and Yadu, as well as the story of Jyamagha, are described.

The sons of Yayati’s fourth son, Anu, were Sabhanara, Caksu and
Paresnu. Of these three, the sons and grandsons of Sabhanara were, in
succession, Kalanara, Sriijjaya, Janamejaya, Mahasiala and Mahamana.
The sons of Mahamani were Usinara and Titiksu. Usinara had four sons,
namely Sibi, Vara, Krmi and Daksa. Sibi also had four sons—
Vrsadarbha, Sudhira, Madra and Kekaya. The son of Titiksu was
Rusadratha, who begot a son named Homa. From Homa came Sutapa and
from Sutapa, Bali. In this way the dynasty continued. Begotten by
Dirghatama in the womb of the wife of Bali were Anga, Vanga, Kalinga,
Suhma, Pundra and Odra, all of whom became kings.

From Anga came Khalapana, whose dynasty included Diviratha,
Dharmaratha and Citraratha, also called Romapada, one after another.
Maharaja Dasaratha gave in charity one of his daughters, by the name
Santa, to his friend Romapada because Romapada had no sons. Romapada
accepted Santa as his daughter, and the great sage Rsyasriga married
her. By the mercy of Rsyaéringa, Romapada had a son named Caturanga.
The son of Caturanga was Prthulaksa, who had three sons—Brhadratha,
Brhatkarma and Brhadbhianu. From Brhadratha came a son named
Brhadmana, whose sons and grandsons in succession were Jayadratha,
Vijaya, Dhrti, Dhrtavrata, Satkarma and Adhiratha. Adhiratha accepted
the son rejected by Kunti, namely Karna, and Karna’s son was Vrsasena.

The son of Yayati’s third son, Druhyu, was Babhru, whose son and
grandsons were Setu, Arabdha, Gandhara, Dharma, Dhrta, Durmada and
Praceta.

The son of Yayati’s second son, Turvasu, was Vahni, whose seminal
dynasty included Bharga, Bhanuman, Tribhanu, Karandhama and
Maruta. The childless Maruta accepted Dusmanta, who belonged to the
Piru dynasty, as his adopted son. Maharaja Dusmanta was anxious to

179

180 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 23
have his kingdom returned, and so he went back to the Piru-vamsa.

Of the four sons of _Yadu, Sahasrajit was the eldest. The son of
Sahasrajit was named Satajit. He had three sons, of whom one was
Haihaya. The sons and grandsons in the dynasty of Haihaya were
Dharma, Netra, Kunti, Sohaiiji, Mahisman, Bhadrasenaka, Dhanaka,
Krtavirya, Arjuna, Jayadhvaja, Talajangha and Vitihotra.

The son of Vitihotra was Madhu, whose eldest son was Vrsni. Because
of Yadu, Madhu and Vrsni, their dynasties are known as Yadava,
Madhava and Vrsni. Another son of Yadu was Krosta, and from him
came Vrjinavan, Svahita, Visadgu, Citraratha, Saabindu, Prthuérava,
Dharma, [68118 and Rucaka. Rucaka had five sons, one of whom was
known as Jyamagha. Jyamagha was sonless, but by the mercy of the
demigods his childless wife gave birth to a son named Vidarbha.

TRANSLATION
From Diviratha came a son named Dharmaratha, and his son was
Citraratha, who was celebrated as Romapada. Romapada, however,
was without issue, and therefore his friend Maharaja Dasaratha
gave him his own daughter, named Santa. Romapada accepted her
as his daughter, and thereafter she married Rsyasriiga. When the
demigods from the heavenly planets failed to shower rain,
Rsyasrnga was appointed the priest for performing a sacrifice,
after being brought from the forest by the allurement of
prostitutes, who danced, staged theatrical performances accom-
panied by music, and embraced and worshiped him. After
Rsyasriiga came, the rain fell. Thereafter, Rsyasrnga performed a
son-giving sacrifice on behalf of Maharaja Dasaratha, who had no
issue, and then Maharaja Dasaratha had sons. From Romapada, by
the mercy of Rsyaérnga, Caturanga was born, and from Caturanga
came Prthulaksa.

named Sahasrajit, Krosta, Nala and Ripu. Of these four, the eldest,
Sahasrajit, had a son named Satajit, who had three sons, named
Mahahaya, Renuhaya and Haihaya.
PURPORT
As confirmed in Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.25101):
vadanti tat tattva-vidas
tattvarn yaj jianam advayam
brahmeti paramatmeti
bhagavan iti sabdyate
“Learned transcendentalists who know the Absolute Truth call this non-
dual substance Brahman, Paramitmia or Bhagavan.” The majority of
transcendentalists understand only the impersonal Brahman or localized
Paramitma, for the Personality of Godhead is very difficult to under-
stand. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (7.3):
manusyanarn sahasresu
kascid yatati siddhaye
yatatam api siddhanarm
kascin marn vetti tattvatah
“Out of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection,
and of those who have achieved perfection, hardly one knows Me in


--- Page 194 ---
192 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 23
truth.” The yogis and jiagnis—that is, the mystic yogis and the imper-
sonalists —can understand the Absolute Truth as impersonal or localized,
but although such realized souls are above ordinary human beings, they
cannot understand how the Supreme Absolute Truth can be a person.
Therefore it is said that out of many siddhas, the souls who have already
realized the Absolute Truth, one may understand Krsna, who exactly
resembles a human being (narakrti). This human form was explained by
Krsna Himself after He manifested the virat-riipa. The virat-ripa is not
the original form of the Lord; the Lord’s original form is Dvibhuja-
Syamasundara, Muralidhara, the Lord with two hands, playing a flute
(yam $yamasundaram acintya-guna-svaripam). The Lord’s forms are
proof of His inconceivable qualities. Although the Lord maintains in-
numerable universes within the period of His breath, He is dressed with
a form exactly like that of a human being. That does not mean, however,
that He is a human being. This is His original form, but because He looks
like a human being, those with a poor fund of knowledge consider Him
an ordinary man. The Lord says:
avajananti mam midha
manusim tanum asritam
param bhavam ajananto
mama bhita-mahesvaram
“Fools deride Me when I descend in the human form. They do not know
My transcendental nature and My supreme dominion over all that be.”
(Bg. 9.11) By the Lord’s parar: bhavam, or transcendental nature, He is
the all-pervading Paramatma living in the core of the hearts of all living
entities, yet He looks like a human being. Mayavada philosophy says that
the Lord is originally impersonal but assumes a human form and many
other forms when He descends. Actually, however, He is originally like a
human being, and the impersonal Brahman consists of the rays of His
body (yasya prabha prabhavato jagad-anda-koti).

TRANSLATION

Long, long ago, Jyamagha had satisfied the demigods and Pitas
by worshiping them. Now, by their mercy, Jyamagha’s words came
true. Although Saibya was barren, by the grace of the demigods
she became pregnant and in due course of time gave birth to a
child named Vidarbha. Before the child’s birth, the girl had been
accepted as a daughter-in-law, and therefore Vidarbha actually
married her when he grew up.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Twenty-
third Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “The Dynasties of the
Sons of Yayati.”

CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR

Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead
Vidarbha had three sons, named Kusa, Kratha and Romapada. Of these
three, Romapada expanded his dynasty by the sons and grandsons named
Babhru, Krti, Usika, Cedi and Caidya, all of whom later became kings.
From the son of Vidarbha named Kratha came a son named Kunti, from
whose dynasty came the descendants named Vrsni, Nirvrti, Dadarha,
Vyoma, Jimata, Vikrti, Bhimaratha, Navaratha, Dasaratha, Sakuni,
Karambhi, Devarata, Devaksatra, Madhu, Kuruvasa, Anu, Puruhotra,
Ayu and Satvata. Satvata had seven sons. One of them was Devavrdha,
whose son was Babhru. Another son of Satvata was Mahabhoja, by whom
the Bhoja dynasty was inaugurated. Another was Vrsni, who had a son
named Yudhajit. From Yudhajit came Anamitra and Sini, and from
Anamitra came Nighna and another Sini. The descendants in succession
from अ were Satyaka, Yuyudhana, Jaya, Kuni and Yugandhara.
Another son of Anamitra was Vrsni. From Vrsni came Svaphalka, by
whom Akrira and twelve other sons were generated. From Akriara came
two sons, named Devavan and Upadeva. The son of Andhaka named
Kukura was the origin of the descendants known as Vahni, Viloma,
Kapotaroma, Anu, Andhaka, Dundubhi, Avidyota, Punarvasu and
Ahuka. Ahuka had two sons, named Devaka and Ugrasena. The four
sons of Devaka were known as Devavan, Upadeva, Sudeva and
Devavardhana, and his seven daughters were Dhrtadeva, Santideva,
Upadeva, Srideva, Devaraksita, Sahadeva and Devaki. Vasudeva married
all seven daughters of Devaka. Ugrasena had nine sons named Kamsa,
Sunama, Nyagrodha, Kanka, Sanku, Suha, Rastrapala, Dhrsti and
Tustiman, and he had five daughters named Karhsa, Karhsavati, Kanka,
Sarabha and Rastrapalika. The younger brothers of Vasudeva married
all the daughters of Ugrasena. |

Vidiratha, the son of Citraratha, had a son named Siira, who had ten
other sons, of whom Vasudeva was the chief. Sara gave one of his five
daughters, Prtha, to his friend Kunti, and therefore she was also named

205

Kunti. In her maiden state she gave birth to a child named Karna, and
later she married Maharaja Pandu.

Vrddhasarma married the daughter of Sra named Srutadeva, from
whose womb Dantavakra was born. Dhrstaketu married Sira’s daughter
named Srutakirti, who had five sons. Jayasena married Sira’s daughter
named Rajadhidevi. The king of Cedi-desa, Damaghosa, married the
daughter of Sara named Srutasrava, from whom SiSupila was born.

Devabhaga, through the womb of Kaisa, begot Citraketu and
Brhadbala; and Devasrava, through the womb of Karnsavati, begot
Suvira and Isuman. From Kanka, through the womb of Kanka, came
Baka, Satyajit and Purujit, and from Sriijaya, through the womb of
Rastrapalika, came Vrsa and Durmarsana. Syamaka, through the womb
of ১০180110111, begot Harikesa and Hiranyaksa. Vatsaka, through the
womb of Miérakesi, begot Vrka, who begot the sons named Taksa,
Puskara and Sala. From Samika came Sumitra and Arjunapala, and from
Anaka came Rtadhama and Jaya.

Vasudeva had many wives, of whom Devaki and Rohini were the most
important. From the womb of Rohini, Baladeva was born, along with
Gada, Sarana, Durmada, Vipula, Dhruva, Krta and others. Vasudeva had
many other sons by his other wives, and the eighth son to appear from
the womb of Devaki was the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who
delivered the entire world from the burden of demons. This chapter ends
by glorifying the Supreme Personality of Godhead Vasudeva.

TRANSLATION
Through Marisa, King Sira begot Vasudeva, Devabhaga,
Devasrava, Anaka, Sriijaya, Syamaka, Kanka, Samika, Vatsaka and
Vrka. These ten sons were spotlessly pious personalities. When
Vasudeva was born, the demigods from the heavenly kingdom
sounded kettledrums. Therefore Vasudeva, who provided the
proper place for the appearance of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Krsna, was also known as Anakadundubhi. The five
daughters of King Siira, named Prtha, Srutadeva, Srutakirti,


--- Page 223 ---
222 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 24.
Srutasrava and Rajadhidevi, were Vasudeva’s sisters. Sura gave
Prtha to his friend Kunti, who had no issue, and therefore another
name of Prtha was Kunti.

TRANSLATION
Once when Durvasa was a guest at the house of Prtha’s father,
Kunti, Prtha satisfied Durvasa by rendering service. Therefore she
received a mystic power by which she could call any demigod. To
examine the potency of this mystic power, the pious Kunti im-
mediately called for the sun-god.

The sun-god said: O beautiful Prtha, your meeting with the
demigods cannot be fruitless. Therefore, let me place my seed in
your womb so that you may bear a son. I shall arrange to keep your
virginity intact, since you are still an unmarried girl.
PURPORT
According to Vedic civilization, if a girl gives birth to a child before
she is married, no one will marry her. Therefore although the sun-god,
after appearing before Prtha, wanted to give her a child, Prtha hesitated


--- Page 225 ---
224 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 24
because she was still unmarried. To keep her virginity undisturbed, the
sun-god arranged to give her a child that came from her ear, and
therefore the child was known as Karna. The custom is that a girl should
be married aksata-yoni, that is, with her virginity undisturbed. A girl
should never bear a child before her marriage.

second sun-god.

TRANSLATION
The eight sons born of Sahadeva such as Pravara and Sruta, were

exact incarnations of the eight Vasus in the heavenly planets.
Vasudeva also begot eight highly qualified sons through the womb
of Devaki. These included Kirtiman, Susena, Bhadrasena, Rju,
Sammardana, Bhadra and Sankarsana, the controller and serpent
incarnation. The eighth son was the Supreme Personality of God-
head Himself —Krsna. The highly fortunate Subhadra, the one
daughter, was your grandmother.

PURPORT

The fifty-fifth verse says, svayam eva harih kila, indicating that

Krsna, the eighth son of Devaki, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Krsna is not an incarnation. Although there is no difference between the
Supreme Personality of Godhead Hari and His incarnation, Krsna is the
original Supreme Person, the complete Godhead. Incarnations exhibit
only a certain percentage of the potencies of Godhead; the complete God-
head is Krsna Himself, who appeared as the eighth son of Devaki.

TRANSLATION

Whenever the principles of religion deteriorate and the prin-
ciples of irreligion increase, the supreme controller, the Per-
sonality of Godhead Sri Hari, appears by His own will.

PURPORT

The principles by which an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead descends upon earth are explained in this verse. The same prin-
ciples are also explained in Bhagavad-gita (4.7) by the Lord Himself:

yada yada hi dharmasya
glanir bhavati bharata
abhyutthanam adharmasya
taddatmanarm srjamy aham
“Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O de-
scendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion—at that time I
descend Myself.”

In the present age, the Supreme Personality of Godhead has appeared
as Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu to inaugurate the Hare Krsna movement. At
the present time, in Kali-yuga, people are extremely sinful and bad
(manda). They have no idea of spiritual life and are misusing the
benefits of the human form to live like cats and dogs. Under these
circumstances Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has inaugurated the Hare Krsna
movement, which is not different from Krsna, the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. If one associates with this movement, he directly associates


--- Page 238 ---
Text 57] Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 237
with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. People should take advantage
of the chanting of the Hare Krsna mantra and thus gain relief from all
the problems created in this age of Kali.

TRANSLATION

O King, Maharaja Pariksit, but for the Lord’s personal desire,
there is no cause for His appearance, disappearance or activities.
As the Supersoul, He knows everything. Consequently there is no
cause that affects Him, not even the results of fruitive activities.

PURPORT

This verse points out the difference between the Supreme Personality
of Godhead and an ordinary living being. An ordinary living being
receives a particular type of body according to his past activities
(karmana daiva-netrena jantur dehopapattaye). A living being is never
independent and can never appear independently. Rather, one is forced
to accept a body imposed upon him by maya according to his past karma.


--- Page 239 ---
238 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 24
As explained in Bhagavad-gita (18.61), yantraradhani mayaya. The
body is a kind of machine created and offered to the living entity by the
material energy under the direction of the Supreme Personality of God-
head. Therefore the living entity must accept a particular type of body
awarded to him by maya, the material energy, according to his karma.
One cannot independently say, “Give me a body like this’ or “Give me a
body like that.” One must accept whatever body is offered by the ma-
terial energy. This is the position of the ordinary living being.
When Krsna descends, however, He does so out of His merciful com-
passion for the fallen souls. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (4.8):
paritranaya sadhana
vinasaya ca duskrtam
dharma-samsthapanarthaya
sambhavami yuge yuge
“To deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to re-
establish the principles of religion, I advent Myself millennium after
millennium.” The Supreme Lord is not forced to appear. Indeed, no one
can subject Him to force, for He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Everyone is under His control, and He is not under the control of anyone
else. Foolish people who because of a poor fund of knowledge think that
one can equal Krsna or become Krsna are condemned in every way. No
one can equal or surpass Krsna, who is therefore described as
asamaurdhva. According to the Visva-kosa dictionary, the word maya is
used in the sense of “false pride” and also in the sense of “compassion.”
For an ordinary living being, the body in which he appears is his punish-
ment. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (7.14), daivi hy esa gunamayi
mama maya duratyaya: “This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the
three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome.” But when
Krsna comes the word maya refers to His compassion or mercy upon the
devotees and fallen souls. By His potency, the Lord can deliver everyone,
whether sinful or pious.

TRANSLATION
The Supreme Personality of Godhead acts through His material
energy in the creation, maintenance and annihilation of this
cosmic manifestation just to deliver the living entity by His com-
passion and stop the living entity’s birth, death and duration of
materialistic life. Thus He enables the living being to return home,
back to Godhead.
PURPORT
Materialistic men sometimes ask why God has created the material
world for the suffering of the living entities. The material creation is cer-
tainly meant for the suffering of the conditioned souls, who are part of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as confirmed by the Lord Himself
in Bhagavad-gita (15.7):
mamaivarso jiva-loke
Jiva-bhitah sanatanah
manah sasthanindriyani
prakrti-sthani karsati
“The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental
parts. Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six
senses, which include the mind.” All the living entities are part and
parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and are as good as the


--- Page 241 ---
240 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 24
Lord qualitatively, but quantitatively there is a great difference between
them, for the Lord is unlimited whereas the living entities are limited.
Thus the Lord possesses unlimited potency for pleasure, and the living
entities have a limited pleasure potency. Anandamayo ’bhydsat
(Vedanta-sitra 1.1.12). Both the Lord and the living entity, being
qualitatively spirit soul, have the tendency for peaceful enjoyment, but
when the part of the Supreme Personality of Godhead unfortunately
wants to enjoy independently, without Krsna, he is put into the material
world, where he begins his life as Brahma and is gradually degraded
to the status of an ant or a worm in stool. This is called manah
sasthanindriyani prakrti-sthani karsati. There is a great struggle for ex-
istence because the living entity conditioned by material nature is under
nature’s full control (prakrteh kriyamanani gunaih karmani sarvasah).
Because of his limited knowledge, however, the living entity thinks he is
enjoying in this material world. Manah sasthanindriyani prakrti-sthani
karsati. He is actually under the full control of material nature, but still
he thinks himself independent (aharnkara-vimidhatma kartaham iti
manyate). Even when he is elevated by speculative knowledge and tries
to merge into the existence of Brahman, the same disease continues.
Aruhya krcchrena param padariv tatah patanty adhah (Bhag. 10.2.32).
Even having attained that param padam, having merged into the imper-
sonal Brahman, he falls again to the material world.

In this way, the conditioned soul undergoes a great struggle for exis-
tence in this material world, and therefore the Lord, out of compassion
for him, appears in this world and instructs him. Thus the Lord says in
Bhagavad-gita (4.7):

yada yada hi dharmasya
glanir bhavati bharata
abhyutthanam adharmasya
tadatmanarm srjamy aham
“Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O de-
scendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion —at that time I
descend Myself.” The real dharma is to surrender unto Krsna, but the
rebellious living entity, instead of surrendering to Krsna, engages in


--- Page 242 ---
Text 58] Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 241
adharma, in a struggle for existence to become like Krsna. Therefore out
of compassion Krsna creates this material world to give the living entity a
chance to understand his real position. Bhagavad-gita and similar Vedic
literatures are presented so that the living being may understand his
relationship with Krsna. Vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah (Bg. 15.15).
All these Vedic literatures are meant to enable the human being to
understand what he is, what his actual position is, and what his relation-
ship is with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is called brahma-
17250. Every conditioned soul is struggling, but human life provides the
best chance for him to understand his position. Therefore this verse says,
anugrahas tan-nivrtteh, indicating that the false life of repeated birth
and death must be stopped and the conditioned soul should be educated.
This is the purpose of the creation.
The creation does not arise whimsically, as atheistic men think.
asatyam apratisthari te
10820 ahur anisvaram
aparaspara-sambhitarn
kim anyat kama-haitukam

“They say that this world is unreal, that there is no foundation and that
there is no God in control. It is produced of sex desire and has no cause
other than lust.” (Bg. 16.8) Atheistic rascals think that there is no God
and that the creation has taken place by chance, just as a man and woman
meet by chance and the woman becomes pregnant and gives birth to a
child. Actually, however, this is not the fact. The fact is that there is a
purpose for this creation: to give the conditioned soul a chance to return
to his original consciousness, Krsna consciousness, and then return
home, back to Godhead, and be completely happy in the spiritual world.
In the material world the conditioned soul is given a chance to satisfy his
senses, but at the same time he is informed by Vedic knowledge that this
material world is not his actual place for happiness. Janma-mrtyu-jara-
vyadhi-duhkha-dosanudarsanam (Bg. 13.9). One must stop the repeti-
tion of birth and death. Every human being, therefore, should take
advantage of this creation by understanding Krsna and his relationship
with Krsna and in this way return home, back to Godhead.

aksauhininam—of kings possessing great military power; patibhih—
by such kings or government; asuraih—actually demons (because they
do not need such military power but create it unnecessarily); nrpa-
laiichanaih—who are actually unfit to be kings (although they have
somehow taken possession of the government); bhuvah—on the surface
of the earth; akramyamanayah—aiming at attacking one another;
abharaya—paving the way for diminishing the number of demons on
the surface of the earth; krta-udyamah—enthusiastic (they spend all the
revenue of the state to increase military power).

TRANSLATION

Although the demons who take possession of the government
are dressed like men of government, they do not know the duty of
the government. Consequently, by the arrangement of God, such
demons, who possess great military strength, fight with one
another, and thus the great burden of demons on the surface of
the earth is reduced. The demons increase their military power by
the will of the Supreme, so that their numbers will be diminished
and the devotees will have a chance to advance in Krsna
consciousness.

PURPORT

As stated in Bhagavad-gita (4.8), paritranaya sadhinam vinasaya ca
duskrtam. The sadhus, the devotees of the Lord, are always eager to ad-
vance the cause of Krsna consciousness so that the conditioned souls may
be released from the bondage of birth and death. But the asuras, the


--- Page 244 ---
Text 59] Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 243
demons, impede the advancement of the Krsna consciousness movement,
and therefore Krsna arranges occasional fights between different asuras
who are very much interested in increasing their military power. The
duty of the government or king is not to increase military power unnec-
essarily; the real duty of the government is to see that the people of the
state advance in Krsna consciousness. For this purpose, Krsna says in
Bhagavad-gita (4.13), catur-varnyarn maya srstam guna-karma-
vibhagasah: “According to the three modes of material nature and the
work ascribed to them, the four divisions of human society were created
by Me.” There should be an ideal class of men who are bona fide
brahmanas, and they should be given all protection. Namo brahmanya-
devaya go-brahmana-hitaya ca. Krsna is very fond of brahmanas
and cows. The brahmanas promulgate the cause of advancement in
Krsna consciousness, and the cows give enough milk to maintain the
body in the mode of goodness. The ksatriyas and the government should
be advised by the brahmanas. Next, the vaisyas should produce enough
foodstuffs, and the §idras, who cannot do anything beneficial on their
own, should serve the three higher classes (the brahmanas, ksatriyas and
vaiSyas). This is the arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead
so that the conditioned souls will be released from the material condition
and return home, back to Godhead. This is the purpose of Krsna’s de-
scent on the surface of the earth (paritranaya sadhinarn vinasaya ca
duskrtam).

Everyone must understand Krsna’s activities (janma karma ca me
divyam). If one understands the purpose of Krsna’s coming to this earth
and performing His activities, one is immediately liberated. This libera-
tion is the purpose of the creation and Krsna’s descent upon the surface
of the earth. Demons are very much interested in advancing a plan by
which people will labor hard like cats, dogs and hogs, but Krsna’s devo-
tees want to teach Krsna consciousness so that people will be satisfied
with plain living and Krsna conscious advancement. Although demons
have created many plans for industry and hard labor so that people will
work day and night like animals, this is not the purpose of civilization.
Such endeavors are jagato ’hitah; that is, they are meant for the misfor-
tune of the people in general. Ksaydya: such activities lead to annihila-
tion. One who understands the purpose of Krsna, the Supreme


--- Page 245 ---
244 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 24
Personality of Godhead, should seriously understand the importance of
the Krsna consciousness movement and seriously take part in it. One
should not endeavor for ugra-karma, or unnecessary work for sense
gratification. Ninam pramattah kurute vikarma yad indriya-pritaya
aprnoti (Bhag. 5.5.4). Simply for sense gratification, people make plans
for material happiness. Maya-sukhaya bharam udvahato vimidhan
(Bhag. 7.9.43). They do this because they are all vimidhas, rascals. For
flickering happiness, people waste their human energy, not understand-
ing the importance of the Krsna consciousness movement but instead ac-
cusing the simple devotees of brainwashing. Demons may falsely accuse
the preachers of the Krsna consciousness movement, but Krsna will ar-
range a fight between the demons in which all their military power will
be engaged and both parties of demons will be annihilated.

TRANSLATION

To show causeless mercy to the devotees who would take birth
in the future in this age of Kali, the Supreme Personality of God-
head, Krsna, acted in such a way that simply by remembering Him
one will be freed from all the lamentation and unhappiness of ma-
terial existence. [In other words, He acted so that all future devo-
tees, by accepting the instructions of Krsna consciousness stated in
Bhagavad-gita, could be relieved from the pangs of material
existence.)

PURPORT

The Lord’s activities of saving the devotees and killing the demons
(paritranaya sadhana vinasaya ca duskrtam) take place side by side.
Krsna actually appears for the deliverance of the sadhus, or bhaktas, but
by killing the demons He shows them mercy also, for anyone killed by
Krsna is liberated. Whether the Lord kills or gives protection, He is kind
to both the demons and the devotees.

TRANSLATION
Simply by receiving the glories of the Lord through purified
transcendental ears, the devotees of the Lord are immediately
freed from strong material desires and engagement in fruitive
activities.
PURPORT
When the devotees aurally receive the activities of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead as enacted in Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-
Bhagavatam, they immediately achieve a transcendental vision in which
they are no longer interested in materialistic activities. Thus they achieve
freedom from the material world. For sense gratification practically
everyone is engaged in materialistic activities, which prolong the process
of janma-mrtyu-jara-vyadhi—birth, death, old age and disease —but the
devotee, simply by hearing the message of Bhagavad-gita and further
relishing the narrations of Srimad-Bhagavatam, becomes so pure that he
no longer takes interest in materialistic activities. At the moment, devo-
tees in the Western countries are being attracted by Krsna consciousness

and becoming uninterested in materialistic activities, and therefore
people are trying to oppose this movement. But they cannot possibly
check this movement or stop the activities of the devotees in Europe and
America by their artificial impositions. Here the words Srotranjalir
upasprsya indicate that simply by hearing the transcendental activities of
the Lord the devotees become so pure that they are immediately immune
to the contamination of materialistic fruitive activities. Anyabhilasita-
Sinyam. Materialistic activities are unnecessary for the soul, and
therefore the devotees are freed from such activities. The devotees are
situated in liberation (brahma-bhiyaya kalpate), and therefore they
cannot be called back to their material homes and materialistic activities.

_ Assisted by the descendants of Bhoja, Vrsni, Andhaka, Madhu,

formed various activities. By His pleasing smiles, His affectionate
behavior, His instructions and His uncommon pastimes like rais-
ing Govardhana Hill, the Lord, appearing in His transcendental
body, pleased all of human society.
PURPORT

The words nrlokarm ramayam asa mirtya sarvanga-ramyaya are sig-
nificant. Krsna is the original form. Bhagavan, the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, is therefore described here by the word miirtya. The word
miirti means “form.” Krsna, or God, is never impersonal; the imper-
sonal feature is but a manifestation of His transcendental body (yasya
prabha prabhavato jagad-anda-koti). The Lord is narakrti, exactly
resembling the form of a human being, but His form is different from
ours. Therefore the word sarvanga-ramyaya informs us that every part
of His body is pleasing for everyone to see. Apart from His smiling face,
every part of His body —His hands, His legs, His chest—is pleasing to
the devotees, who cannot at any time stop seeing the beautiful form of
the Lord.

His smiling attractive to everyone. Whoever sees Lord Krsna sees a
festival. His face and body are fully satisfying for everyone to see,
but the devotees are angry at the creator for the disturbance
caused by the momentary blinking of their eyes.
PURPORT
As stated by the Lord Himself in the Bhagavad-gita (7.3):
manusyandrir sahasresu
kascid yatati siddhaye
yatatam api siddhanarii
kascin marh vetti tattvatah
“Out of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection,
and of those who have achieved perfection, hardly one knows Me in
truth.” Unless one is qualified to understand Krsna, one cannot appreci-
ate the presence of Krsna on earth. Among the Bhojas, Vrsnis,
Andhakas, Pandavas and many other kings intimately related with
Krsna, the intimate relationship between Krsna and the inhabitants of


--- Page 251 ---
250 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 24
Vrndavana is especially to be noted. That relationship is described in this
verse by the words nityotsavari na tatrpur drsibhih pibantyah. The in-
habitants of Vrndavana especially, such as the cowherd boys, the cows,
the calves, the gopis and Krsna’s father and mother, were never fully
satisfied, although they saw Krsna’s beautiful features constantly. Seeing
Krsna is described here as nitya-utsava, a daily festival. The inhabitants
of Vrndavana saw Krsna almost every moment, but when Krsna left the
village for the pasturing grounds, where He tended the cows and calves,
the gopis were very much afflicted because they saw Krsna walking on
the sand and thought that Krsna’s lotus feet, which they dared not place
on their breasts because they thought their breasts not soft enough, were
being pierced by broken chips of stone. By even thinking of this, the
gopis were affected, and they cried at home. These gopis, who were
therefore the exalted friends of Krsna, saw Krsna constantly, but because
their eyelids disturbed their vision of Krsna, the gopis condemned the
creator, Lord Brahma. Therefore the beauty of Krsna, especially the
beauty of His face, is described here. At the end of the Ninth Canto, in
the Twenty-fourth Chapter, we find a hint of Krsna’s beauty. Now we
are proceeding to the Tenth Canto, which is considered Krsna’s head.
The entire Srimad-Bhagavata Purana is the embodiment of Krsna’s
form, and the Tenth Canto is His face. This verse gives a hint of how
beautiful His face is. Krsna’s smiling face, with His cheeks, His lips, the
ornaments in His ears, His chewing of betel nuts—all this was minutely
observed by the gopis, who thus enjoyed transcendental bliss, so much so
that they were never fully satisfied to see Krsna’s face, but instead con-
demned the creator of the body for making eyelids that obstructed their
vision. The beauty of Krsna’s face was therefore much more appreciated
by the gopis than by His friends the cowherd boys or even by 38003
Mata, who was also interested in decorating the face of Krsna.

TRANSLATION
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Krsna, known as lila-
purusottama, appeared as the son of Vasudeva but immediately left
His father’s home and went to Vrndavana to expand His loving
relationship with His confidential devotees. In Vrndavana the Lord
killed many demons, and afterwards He returned to Dvaraka,
where according to Vedic principles He married many wives who
were the best of women, begot through them hundreds of sons,
and performed sacrifices for His own worship to establish the
principles of householder life.
PURPORT
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (15.15), vedais ca sarvair aham eva
vedyah: by all the Vedas, it is Krsna who is to be known. Lord Sri Krsna,
setting an example by His own behavior, performed many ritualistic
ceremonies described in the Vedas and established the principles of
grhastha life by marrying many wives and begetting many children just
to show people in general how to be happy by living according to Vedic
principles. The center of Vedic sacrifice is Krsna (vedais ca sarvair aham


--- Page 253 ---
252 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 9, Ch. 24
eva vedyah). To advance in human life, human society must follow the
Vedic principles personally demonstrated by Lord Krsna in His house-
holder life. The real purpose of Krsna’s appearance, however, was to
manifest how one can take part in loving affairs with the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead. Reciprocations of loving affairs in ecstasy are possi-
ble only in Vrndavana. Therefore just after His appearance as the son of
Vasudeva, the Lord immediately left for Vrndavana. In Vrndavana, the
Lord not only took part in loving affairs with His father and mother, the
gopis and the cowherd boys, but also gave liberation to many demons by
killing them. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (4.8), paritrandya sadhanam
vindsaya ca duskrtam: the Lord appears in order to protect the devotees
and kill the demons. This was fully exhibited by His personal behavior.
In Bhagavad-gita the Lord is understood by Arjuna to be purusam
$asvatarh divyam—the eternal, transcendental Supreme Person. Here
also we find the words utpddya tesu purusah. Therefore it is to be con-
cluded that the Absolute Truth is purusa, a person. The impersonal
feature is but one of the features of His personality. Ultimately, He is a
person; He is not impersonal. And not only is He purusa, a person, but
He is the lila-purusottama, the best of all persons.

TRANSLATION

Thereafter, Lord Sri Krsna created a misunderstanding between
family members just to diminish the burden of the world. Simply
by His glance, He annihilated all the demoniac kings on the Bat-
tlefield of Kuruksetra and declared victory for Arjuna. Finally, He
instructed Uddhava about transcendental life and devotion and
then returned to His abode in His original form.

PURPORT

Paritranaya sadhiinam vinasaya ca duskrtam. The mission of Lord
Krsna was performed on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra, for by the Lord’s
mercy Arjuna was victorious due to being a great devotee whereas the
others were killed simply by the Lord’s glance, which cleansed them of
all sinful activities and enabled them to attain s@ripya. Finally, Lord
Krsna instructed Uddhava about the transcendental life of devotional
service, and then, in due course of time, He returned to His abode. The
Lord’s instructions in the form of Bhagavad-gita are full of jana and
vairagya, knowledge and renunciation. In the human form of life, one
must learn these two things —how to become detached from the material
world and how to acquire full knowledge in spiritual life. This is the
Lord’s mission (paritranaya sadhindm vinasaya ca duskrtam). After
executing His complete mission, the Lord returned to His home, Goloka
Vrndavana.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Twenty-
fourth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “Krsna, the Su-
preme Personality of Godhead.”

—Completed in Bhuvanesvara, India, on the occasion of establishing a
Krsna-Balarama temple.

The Author

His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada appeared in
this world in 1896 in Calcutta, India. He first met his spiritual master,
Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami, in Calcutta in 1922. Bhakti-
siddhanta Sarasvati, a prominent devotional scholar and the founder of
sixty-four Gaudiya Mathas (Vedic institutes), liked this educated young
man and convinced him to dedicate his life to teaching Vedic knowledge.
Srila Prabhupada became his student, and eleven years later (1933) at
Allahabad he became his formally initiated disciple.

At their first meeting, in 1922, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati
Thakura requested Srila Prabhupada to broadcast Vedic knowledge
through the English language. In the years that followed, Srila Prabhu-
pada wrote a commentary on the Bhagavad-gita, assisted the Gaudiya
Matha in its work and, in 1944, without assistance, started an English
fortnightly magazine, edited it, typed the manuscripts and checked the
galley proofs. He even distributed the individual copies freely and strug-
gled to maintain the publication. Once begun, the magazine never
stopped; it is now being continued by his disciples in the West.

Recognizing Srila Prabhupada’s philosophical learning and devotion,
the Gaudiya Vaisnava Society honored him in 1947 with the title
“Bhaktivedanta.”” In 1950, at the age of fifty-four, Srila Prabhupada
retired from married life, and four years later he adopted the
vanaprastha (retired) order to devote more time to his studies and writ-
ing. Srila Prabhupada traveled to the holy city of Vrndavana, where he
lived in very humble circumstances in the historic medieval temple of
Radha-Damodara. There he engaged for several years in deep study and
writing. He accepted the renounced order of life (sannyasa) in 1959. At
Radha-Damodara, Srila Prabhupada began work on his life’s master-
piece: amultivolume translation and commentary on the eighteen thou-
sand verse Srimad-Bhagavatam (Bhagavata Purana). He also wrote
Easy Journey to Other Planets. |

After publishing three volumes of Bhagavatam, Srila Prabhupada
came to the United States, in 1965, to fulfill the mission of his spiritual
master. Since that time, His Divine Grace has written over forty volumes
of authoritative translations, commentaries and summary studies of the
philosophical and religious classics of India.

258 Srimad-Bhagavatam

In 1965, when he first arrived by freighter in New York City, Srila
Prabhupada was practically penniless. It was after almost a year of great
difficulty that he established the International Society for Krishna Con-
sciousness in July of 1966. Under his careful guidance, the Society has
grown within a decade to a worldwide confederation of almost one
hundred asramas, schools, temples, institutes and farm communities.

In 1968, Srila Prabhupada created New Vrndavana, an experimental
Vedic community in the hills of West Virginia. Inspired by the success of
New Vrndavana, now a thriving farm community of more than one thou-
sand acres, his students have since founded several similar communities
in the United States and abroad.

In 1972, His Divine Grace introduced the Vedic system of primary and
secondary education in the West by founding the Gurukula school in
Dallas, Texas. The school began with 3 children in 1972, and by the
beginning of 1975 the enrollment had grown to 150.

Srila Prabhupada has also inspired the construction of a large inter-
national center at Sridhama Mayapur in West Bengal, India, which 15 also
the site for a planned Institute of Vedic Studies. A similar project is the
magnificent Krsna-Balarama Temple and International Guest House in
Vrndavana, India. These are centers where Westerners can live to gain
firsthand experience of Vedic culture.

Srila Prabhupada’s most significant contribution, however, is his
books. Highly respected by the academic community for their authori-
tativeness, depth and clarity, they are used as standard textbooks in
numerous college courses. His writings have been translated into eleven
languages. The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, established in 1972 ex-
clusively to publish the works of His Divine Grace, has thus become the
world’s largest publisher of books in the field of Indian religion and phi-
losophy. Its latest project is the publishing of Srila Prabhupada’s most
recent work: a seventeen-volume translation and commentary —com-
pleted by Srila Prabhupada in only eighteen months—on the Bengali
religious classic Sri Caitanya-caritamrta.

In the past ten years, in spite of his advanced age, Srila Prabhupada
has circled the globe twelve times on lecture tours that have taken him to
six continents. In spite of such a vigorous schedule, Srila Prabhupada
continues to write prolifically. His writings constitute a veritable library
of Vedic philosophy, religion, literature and culture.
