CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE
The Descriptions of the Characteristics
of King Puraiijana

majtreyah uvaca—the great sage Maitreya continued to speak; iti— thus;
sandisya—giving instruction; bhagavin—most powerful lord; barhisadaih— by
the sons of King Barhigat; abhipiijitah—being worshiped; pasyatam—while
they were looking on; rdja-putranam—the sons of the King; tatra—there;

TRANSLATION
The great sage Maitreya continued speaking to Vidura: My dear Vidura,
in this way Lord Siva instructed the sons of King Barhisat. The sons of the
King also worshiped Lord Siva with great devotion and respect. Finally,
Lord Siva became invisible to the princes.
PURPORT
This chapter contains a great lesson concerning the monarchical kingdom
in the days of yore. When King Barhisat was considering retiring from the
royal duties, he sent his sons to perform austerities in order to become
perfect kings for the welfare of the citizens. At the same time King Barhisat
1133


--- Page 2 ---
1134 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 25
was being instructed by the great sage Narada about the material world and
the living entity who wants to enjoy it. It is therefore very clear how the
kings and princes were trained to take charge of a kingdom. Welfare activi-
tiesfor the benefit of the citizens were aimed at understanding the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. The human form of life is especially meant for
understanding God, our relationship with Him and our activities in His
service. Because the kings took charge of the spiritual education of the
citizens, both the king and the citizens were happy in Krsna consciousness.
In this regard, we should remember that the monarchical hierarchy of
Pracinabarhisat comes from Maharaja Dhruva, a great devotee of the Lord
and the most celebrated disciple of Narada Muni. King Pracinabarhisat was
then too much engaged in fruitive activities due to performing different
types of yajiias. One can actually be promoted to higher planetary systems
or to the heavenly kingdoms by performing various yajiias, but there is no
question of liberation or going back home, back to Godhead. When the
great sage Narada saw that a descendant of Maharaja Dhruva was being
misled by fruitive activities, he took compassion upon him and personally
came to instruct him about the ultimate benediction of life, bhakti-yoga.
How Narada Muni indirectly introduced the bhakti-yoga system to
King Pracinabarhisat is very interestingly described in this Twenty-fifth
Chapter.

TRANSLATION

All the Praceta princes simply stood in the water for ten thousand years

and recited the prayers given to them by Lord Siva.

PURPORT

Of course in the modern age one may be amazed how the princes could
stand in the water for ten thousand years. However, living within air or
living within water is the same process; one simply has to learn how to do
it. The aquatics live within water for their whole life span. Certain favorable
conditions are created to enable them to live within water. In those days,
however, people used to live for 100,000 years. Out of so many years, if
one could spare ten thousand years for the sake of austerity, he would be
assured of success in his future life. This was not very astonishing. Although
such a feat is impossible in this age, it was quite possible in Satya-yuga.

TRANSLATION

While the princes were undergoing severe austerities in the water, their
father was performing different types of fruitive activities. At this time the
great saint Narada, master and teacher of all spiritual life, became very
compassionate upon the King and decided to instruct him about spiritual
life.

PURPORT

As pointed out by Prabodhananda Sarasvati Thakura, a great devotee of
Lord Caitanya, kaivalya, or merging into the Brahman effulgence, is just
like going to hell. He similarly states that elevation to the upper planetary
systems for the enjoyment of heavenly life is just so much phantasmagoria.


--- Page 4 ---
1136 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 25
This means that a devotee does not give any importance to the ultimate
goal of the karmis and jiianis. The ultimate goal of the karmis is promotion
to the heavenly kingdom, and the ultimate goal of the jadnis is merging
into the Brahman effulgence. Of course the jianis are superior to the
karmis, as confirmed by Lord Caitanya: koti-karmanistha-madhye eka
Jnani’ srestha. “One jadni, or impersonalist, is better than many thousands
of fruitive actors.” (Cc. Madhya 19.147) Therefore a devotee never enters
upon the path of karma, or elevation by fruitive activities. Narada Muni
took compassion upon King Pracinabarhisat when he saw the King engaged
in fruitive activity. In comparison to mundane workers, however, those
who are trying to be elevated to the higher planetary systems by performing
yajias are undoubtedly superior. In pure devotional service, however, both
karma and jidna are considered to be bewildering features of the illusory
energy.

TRANSLATION
Narada Muni asked King Pracinabarhisat: My dear King, what do you
desire to achieve by performing these fruitive activities? The chief aim of
life is to get rid of all miseries and enjoy happiness, but these two things
cannot be realized by fruitive activity.
PURPORT
In this material world there is a great illusion which covers real intelli-
gence. A man in the mode of passion wants to work very hard to derive


--- Page 5 ---
~

Text 4] The Characteristics of King Purafjana 1137
some benefit, but he does not know that time will never allow him to
enjoy anything permanently. Compared to the work one expends, the gain
is not so profitable. Even if it is profitable, it is not without its distresses.
If a man is not born rich, and he wants to purchase a house, cars and other
material things, he has to work hard day and night for many years in order
to possess them. Thus happiness is not attained without undergoing some
distress.

Actually pure happiness cannot be had within this material world. If we
wish to enjoy something, we must suffer for something else. On the whole,
suffering is the nature of this material world, and whatever enjoyment we
are trying to achieve is simply illusion. After all, we have to suffer the
miseries of birth, old age, disease and death. We may discover many fine
medicines, but it is not possible to stop the sufferings of disease or death.
Actually medicine is not the counteracting agent for either disease or death.
On the whole there is no happiness in this material world, but an illusioned
person works very hard for so-called happiness. Indeed, this process of
working hard is actually taken for happiness. This is called illusion.

Therefore Narada Muni asked King Pracinabarhisat what he desired to
attain by performing so many costly sacrifices. Even if one attains a
heavenly planet, he cannot avoid the distresses of birth, old age, disease
and death. Someone may argue that even devotees have to undergo many
distresses in executing austerities and penances connected with devotional
service. Of course for the neophytes the routine of devotional service may
be very painful, but at least they have the hope that they will ultimately
be able to avoid all kinds of distresses and achieve the highest perfectional
stage of happiness. For the common karmdis, there is no such hope because
even if they are promoted to the higher planetary systems, they are not
guaranteed freedom from the miseries of birth, old age, disease and death.
Even Lord Brahma, who is situated in the highest planetary system
(Brahmaloka), has to die. Lord Brahma’s birth and death may be different
from an ordinary man’s, but within this material world he cannot avoid
the distresses of birth, old age, disease and death. If one is at all serious
about attaining liberation from these miseries, he must take to devotional
service. This is confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gita:

janma karma ca me divyam
evam yo vetti tattvatah

tyaktva dehar punar janma
naiti mam eti so ‘rjuna

“One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and
activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this


--- Page 6 ---
1138 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 25
material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.” (Bg. 4.9)

Thus after attaining full Krsna consciousness, the devotee does not
return to this material world after death. He goes back home, back to
Godhead. That is the perfect stage of happiness, unblemished by any trace
of distress.

TRANSLATION

The King replied: O great soul, Narada, my intelligence is entangled in
fruitive activities; therefore I do not know the ultimate goal of life. Kindly
instruct me in pure knowledge so that I can get out of the entanglement
of fruitive activities.

PURPORT
Sri Narottama dasa Thakura has sung:
sat-sanga chadi’ kainu asate vilasa
te-karane lagila ye karma-bandha-phansa

As long as a person is entangled in fruitive activities, he is bound to
accept one body after another. This is called karma-bandha-phansa—
entanglement in fruitive activities. It does not matter whether one is
engaged in pious or impious activities, for both are causes for further


--- Page 7 ---
Text 6] The Characteristics of King Puraiijana 1139
entanglement in material bodies. By pious activities one can take birth
in a rich family and get a good education and a beautiful body, but this
does not mean that the distresses of life are ultimately eliminated. In the
Western countries it is not unusual for one to take birth in a rich aristo-
cratic family, nor is it unusual for one to have a good education and a very
beautiful body, but this does not mean that Westerners are free from the
distresses of life. Although at the present moment the younger generation
in Western countries has sufficient education, beauty and wealth, and
although there is enough food, clothing and facilities for sense gratification,
they are in distress. Indeed, they are so distressed that they become
“hippies,” and the laws of nature force them to accept a wretched life.
Thus they go about unclean and without shelter or food, and they are
forced to sleep in the street. It can be concluded that one cannot become
happy by simply performing pious activities. It is not a fact that those who
are born with a silver spoon in their mouths are free from the material
miseries of birth, old age, disease and death. The conclusion is that one
cannot be happy by simply executing pious or impious activities. Such
activities simply cause entanglement and transmigration from one body
to another. Narottama dasa Thakura calls this karma-bandha-pharisa.

King Pracinabarhigat admitted this fact and frankly asked Narada Muni
how he could get out of this karma-bandha-phansa, entanglement in
fruitive activities. This is actually the stage of knowledge indicated in the
first verse of Vedanta-sutra: athato brahma-jijiasa (Vs. 1.1.1). When one
actually reaches the platform of frustration in an attempt to discharge
karma-bandha-phansa, he inquires about the real value of life, which is
called brahma-jijiasa. In order to inquire about the ultimate goal
of life, the Vedas enjoin: tad vijaianartharn sa gurum evabhigacchet
(Mundaka Up. 1.2.12). “In order to understand the transcendental science,
one must approach a bona fide spiritual master.”

King Pracinabarhigat found the best spiritual master, Narada Muni, and
he therefore asked him about that knowledge by which one can get out of
the entanglement of karma-bandha-phansa, fruitive activities. This is the
actual business of human life. Jivasya tattva-jijiasa nartho yas ceha
karmabhih (Bhag. 1.2.10). As stated in the Second Chapter of the First
Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam, a human being’s only business is inquiring
from a bona fide spiritual master about extrication from the entanglement
of karma-bandha-pharisa .

grhesu kuta-dharmesu
putra-dara-dhanartha-dhih
na param vindate mudho
bhramyan samsara-vartmasu

grhesu—in family life; kiita-dharmesu—in false occupational duties; putra
—sons; dara— wife; dhana—wealth; artha—the goal of life; dhth—one who
considers; na—not; param— transcendence; vindate—achieves; midhah—
rascal; bhramyan—wandering; sarisara—of material existence; vartmasu—on
the paths.

TRANSLATION

Those who are only interested in a so-called beautiful life—namely
remaining as a householder entangled by sons and a wife and searching
after wealth—think that such things are life’s ultimate goal. Such people
simply wander in different types of bodies throughout this material exist-
ence without finding out the ultimate goal of life.

PURPORT

Those who are too much attached to family life—which consists of
entanglement with wife, children, wealth and home—are engaged in kuta-
dharma, pseudo-duties. Prahlada Maharaja has likened these pseudo
occupational duties to a dark well (andha-kiipa). Prahlada has purposefully
spoken of this dark well because if one falls into this well, he will die. He
may cry for help, but no one will hear him or come to rescue him.

The words bhramyan sarisara-vartmasu are significant. In Caitanya-
caritamrta, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu very clearly explains: brahmanda
bhramite kona bhagyavan jiva (Cc. Madhya 19.151). All living entities are
wandering in different types of bodies throughout different planets, and
if, in the course of their wanderings, they come in contact with a devotee
by the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, their lives become
successful. Even though King Pracinabarhisat was engaged in fruitive
activity, the great sage Narada appeared before him. The King was very
fortunate to be able to associate with Narada, who enlightened him in
spiritual knowledge. It is the duty of all saintly persons to follow in the
footsteps of Narada Muni and travel all over the world to every country
and village just to instruct illusioned persons about the goal of life and to
save them from the entanglement of karma-bandha, fruitive activity.

Jiva-sanghan—groups of animals; nirghrpena—without pity; sahasrasah—in

TRANSLATION

The great saint Narada said: O ruler of the citizens, my dear King, please
see in the sky those animals which you have sacrificed without compassion
and without mercy in the sacrificial arena.

PURPORT

Because animal sacrifice is recommended in the Vedas, there are animal
sacrifices in almost all religious rituals. However, one should not be satisfied
simply by killing animals according to the directions of the scriptures. One
should transcend the ritualistic ceremonies and try to understand the actual
truth, the purpose of life. Narada Muni wanted to instruct the King about
the real purpose of life and invoke a spirit of renunciation in his heart.
Knowledge and the spirit of renunciation (jiiana-vairagya) are the ultimate
goal of life. Without knowledge, one cannot become detached from mate-
rial enjoyment, and without being detached from material enjoyment, one
cannot make spiritual advancement. Karmis are generally engaged in sense
gratification, and for this end they are prepared to commit so many sinful
activities. Animal sacrifice is but one such sinful activity. Consequently,
by his mystic power Narada Muni showed King Pracinabarhisat the dead
animals which he had sacrificed.

utthita—enlivened; manyavah—anger.

TRANSLATION

All these animals are awaiting your death so that they can avenge the
injuries you have inflicted upon them. After you die, they will angrily
pierce your body with iron horns.

PURPORT

Narada Muni wanted to draw King Pracinabarhigat’s attention to the
excesses of killing animals in sacrifices. It is said in the $astras that by
killing animals in a sacrifice, one immediately promotes them to human
birth. Similarly, by killing their enemies on a battlefield, the ksatriyas who
fight for a right cause are elevated to the heavenly planets after death. In
Manu-sarhhita it is stated that it is necessary for a king to execute a mur-
derer so that the murderer will not suffer for his criminal actions in his
next life. On the basis of such understanding, Narada Muni warns the King
that the animals killed in sacrifices by the King await him at his death in
order to avenge themselves. Narada Muni is not contradicting himself here.
Narada Muni wanted to convince the King that overindulgence in animal
sacrifice is risky because as soon as there is a small discrepancy in the
execution of such a sacrifice, the slaughtered animal may not be promoted
to a human form of life. Consequently the person performing sacrifice will
be responsible for the death of the animal, just as much as a murderer is
responsible for killing another man. When animals are killed in a slaughter-
house, six people connected with the killing are responsible for the murder.
The person who gives permission for the killing, the person who kills, the


--- Page 11 ---
Text 9] The Characteristics of King Purafjana 1143
person who helps, the person who purchases the meat, the person who
cooks the flesh and the person who eats it, all become entangled in the
killing. Narada Muni wanted to draw the King’s attention to this fact. Thus
animal killing is not encouraged even in a sacrifice.

TRANSLATION
In this connection I wish to narrate an old history connected with the
character of a king called Puraiijana. Please try to hear me with great
attention.
PURPORT
The great sage Narada Muni turned toward another topic—the history of
King Puranjana. This is nothing but the history of King Pracinabarhisat
told in a different way. In other words, this is an allegorical presentation.
The word purafijana means “one who enjoys in a body.” This is clearly
explained in the next few chapters. Because a person entangled in material
activities wants to hear stories of material activities, Narada Muni turned
to the topics of King Puraijana, who is none other than King
Pracinabarhigat. Narada Muni did not, however, deprecate the value of
performing sacrifices in which animals are sacrificed. Lord Buddha, how-
ever, directly rejected all animal sacrifice. Srila Jayadeva Gosvami has
stated: nindasi yajiia-vidher ahaha sruti-jatam. The word $ruti-jatam indi-
cates that in the Vedas animal sacrifice is recommended, but Lord Buddha
directly denied Vedic authority in order to stop animal sacrifice. Conse-
quently Lord Buddha is not accepted by the followers of the Vedas.


--- Page 12 ---
1144 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 25
Because he does not accept the authority of the Vedas, Lord Buddha is
depicted as an agnostic or atheist. The great sage Narada cannot decry the
authority of the Vedas, but he wanted to indicate to King Pracinabarhisat
that the path of karma-kanda is very difficult and risky.

Foolish persons accept the difficult path of karma-kanda for the sake of
sense enjoyment, and those who are too much attached to sense enjoyment
are called mudhas (rascals). It is very difficult for a mudha to understand
the ultimate goal of life. In the propagation of the Krsna consciousness
movement, we actually see that many people are not attracted because
they are midhas engaged in fruitive activity. It is said: upadeso hi
mitrkhanam prakopaya na santaye (Hitopadesa). If good instructions are
given to a foolish rascal, he simply becomes angry and turns against the
instructions instead of taking advantage of them. Because Narada Muni
knew this very well, he indirectly instructed the King by giving him the
history of his entire life. In order to wear a gold or diamond nose pin or
earring, one has to pierce the ear or nose. Such pain endured for the sake
of sense gratification is endured on the path of karma-kanda, the path of
fruitive activity. If one wishes to enjoy something in the future, he has to
endure trouble in the present. If one wants to become a millionaire in the
future and enjoy his riches, he has to work very hard at the present
moment in order to accumulate money. This is karma-kandtya. Those who
are too much attached to such a path undergo the risk anyway. Narada
Muni wanted to show King Pracinabarhisat how one undergoes great
troubles and miseries in order to engage in fruitive activity. A person who
is very much attached to material activity is called visayi. A visayi is an
enjoyer of visaya, which means eating, sleeping, mating and defending.
Narada Muni is indirectly indicating through the story of King Purafjana
that eating, sleeping, mating and defending are troublesome and risky.

The words itihasam (history) and puratanam (old) indicate that although
a living entity lives within the material body, the history of the living
entity within the material body is very old. In this regard, Srila
Bhaktivinoda Thakura has sung: anadi karama-phale, padi’ bhavarnava-jale,
taribare na dekhi upaya. “Due to my past fruitive activities I have fallen
into the water of material existence, and I cannot find any way to get out
of it.”” Every living entity is suffering in this material existence from past
activities; therefore everyone has a very old history. Foolish material
scientists have manufactured their own theories of evolution, which are
simply concerned with the material body. But actually this is not the real
evolution. The real evolution is the history of the living entity, who is
puraiijana, living within the body. Sri Narada Muni will explain this evolu-
tionary theory in a different way for the understanding of sane persons.

TRANSLATION

My dear King, once in the past lived a king named Puranjana, who was
celebrated for his great activities. He had a friend named Avijiata [the
unknown one]. No one could understand the activities of Avijiiata.

PURPORT

Every living entity is puraiijana. The word puram means within this
body, within this form, and jana means living entity. Thus everyone is
purafijana. Every living entity is supposed to be the king of his body
because the living entity is given full freedom to use his body as he likes.
He usually engages his body for sense gratification, because one who is in
the bodily conception of life feels that the ultimate goal of life is to serve
the senses. This 15 the process of karma-kdpda. One who has no inner knowl-
edge, who does not know that he is actually the spirit soul living within
the body, who is simply enamored by the dictation of the senses, is called
a materialist. A materialistic person interested in sense gratification can be
called a purafijana. Because such a materialistic person utilizes his senses
according to his whims, he may also be called a king. An irresponsible king
takes the royal position to be his personal property and misuses his treasury
for sense gratification.

The word brhac-chravah is also significant. The word sravah means fame.
The living entity is famous from ancient times, for, as stated in Bhagavad-
gita, na jayate mriyate va (Bg. 2.20). “The living entity is never born and
never dies.” Because he is eternal, his activities are eternal, although they
are performed in different types of bodies. Na hanyate hanyamane sarire


--- Page 14 ---
1146 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 25
(Bg. 2.20). “He does not die, even after the annihilation of the body.” Thus
the living entity transmigrates from one body to another and performs
various activities. In each body the living entity performs so many acts.
Sometimes he becomes a great hero—just like Hiranyakasipu and Kamsa,
or in the modern age Napoleon or Hitler. The activities of such men are
certainly very great, but as soon as their bodies are finished, everything else
is finished. Then they remain in name only. Therefore a living entity may
be called brhac-chravah; he may have a great reputation for various types
of activities. Nonetheless, he has a friend whom he does not know. Mate-
rialistic persons do not understand that God is present as the Supersoul
and situated within the heart of every living entity. Although the Param-
atma sits beside the jivatma as a friend, the jivatma, or living entity, does
not know it. Consequently he is described as avijiiata-sakhd, meaning “one
who has an unknown friend.” The word avijiiata-cestitah is also significant
because a living entity works hard under the direction of the Paramatma
and is carried away by the laws of nature. Nonetheless, he thinks himself
independent of God and independent of the stringent laws of material
nature. It is stated in Bhagavad-gita:
acchedyo yam adahyo yam
akledyo ’$osya eva ca
nityah sarva-gatah sthapur
acalo yarn sandtanah

“This individual soul is unbreakable and insoluble and can be neither
burned nor dried. He is everlasting, all-pervading, unchangeable, immovable
and eternally the same.” (Bg. 2.24)

The living entity is sanatana, eternal. Because he cannot be killed by any
weapon, burnt into ashes by fire, soaked or moistened by water, nor dried
up by air, he is considered to be immune to material reactions. Although
he is changing bodies, he is not affected by the material conditions. He is
placed under the material conditions, and he acts according to the direc-
tions of his friend, the Supersoul. As stated in Bhagavad-gita:

sarvasya cahari hrdi sannivisto
mattah smrtir [72710771 apohanam ca
vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyo

edge and forgetfulness. By all the Vedas am I to be known; indeed I am

the compiler of Vedanta, and I am the knower of the Vedas. (Bg. 15.15)
Thus the Lord as Paramatma is situated in everyone's heart, and He gives
directions to the living entity to act in whatever way the living entity
desires. In this life and in his previous lives the living entity does not know
that the Lord is giving him a chance to fulfill all kinds of desires. No one
can fulfill any desire without the sanction of the Lord. All the facilities
given by the Lord are unknown to the conditioned soul.

TRANSLATION
King एप्प कोका began to search for a suitable place to live, and thus he
traveled all over the world. Even after a great deal of traveling, he could
not find a place just to his liking. Finally he became morose and
disappointed.
PURPORT
The travelings of Purainjana are similar to the travelings of the modern
hippies. Generally hippies are sons of great fathers and great families. It is
not that they are always poor. But some way or another they abandon the
shelter of their rich fathers and travel all over the world. As stated in this
verse, the living entity wants to become a prabhu, or master. The word
prabhu means master, but actually the living entity is not a master; he is
the eternal servant of God. When the living entity abandons the shelter of
God, Krsna, and tries to become a prabhu independently, he travels all
over the creation. There are 8,400,000 species of life and millions and
millions and trillions of planets within the creation. The living entity


--- Page 16 ---
1148 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 25
wanders throughout these various types of bodies and throughout different
planets, and thus he is like King Purafijana, who travels all over the world
looking for a suitable place to live.

Sri Narottama dasa Thakura has sung: karma-kanda, jiiana-kanda, kevala
visera bhanda. “The path of karma-kanda [fruitive activities] and the path
of jiiana-kanda [speculation] are just like strong pots of poison.” Amrta
baliya yeba khaya, nana yoni sada phire: “A person who mistakes this
poison to be nectar and drinks it travels in different species of life.”” Kadarya
bhaksana kare: “And, according to his body, he eats all types of abomi-
nable things.” For instance, when the living entity is in the body of a hog,
he eats stool. When the living entity is in the body of a crow, he eats all
kinds of refuse, even pus and mucus, and enjoys it. Thus Narottama dasa
Thakura points out that theliving entity travels in different types of bodies
and eats all kinds of abominable things. When he does not become ulti-
mately happy, he becomes morose or takes to the ways of hippies.

Thus in this verse it is said (na anuriipam) that the King could never find
a place suitable for his purposes. This is because in any form of life and on
any planet in the material world, a living entity cannot be happy because
everything in the material world is unsuitable for the spirit soul. As stated
in this verse, the living entity independently wants to become a prabhu,
but as soon as he gives up this idea and becomes a servant of God, Krsna,
his happiness immediately begins. Therefore Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura
sings: (miche) mayara vase, ydccha bhese’, khaccha habudubu, bhai. “My
dear living entity, why are you being carried away by the waves of maya?”
As stated in the Bhagavad-gita:

i$varah sarva-bhitandr
hrd-dese ’rjuna tisthati |
bhramayan sarva-bhitani
yantraridhani mayayd
“The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone’s heart, O Arjuna, and is direct-
ing the wanderings of all living entities, who are seated as on a machine,
made of the material energy.” (Bg. 18.61)

The living entity is carried in the machine of the body through so many
species of life on so many planets. Therefore Bhaktivinoda Thakura asks
the living entity why he is being carried away in these bodily machines to
be placed in so many different circumstances. He advises that one surmount
the waves of maya by surrendering unto Krsna. (Jiva) krsna-dasa, € visvasa,
karle ta’ ara duhkha nai. As soon as we confront Krsna, Krsna advises:


--- Page 17 ---
Text 12] The Characteristics of King Purafijana 1149
sarva-dharman parityajya
mam eka $arapam vraja
ahari tvam sarva-papebhyo
moksayisyami ma sucah
“Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall
deliver you from all sinful reaction. Do not fear.” (Bg. 18.66)

Thus we are immediately relieved from traveling from one body to
another and from one planet to another. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu says:
07012770000 bhramite kona bhagyavan jiva (Cc. Madhya 19.151). If, while
traveling, a living entity becomes fortunate enough to become blessed by
the association of devotees and to come to Krsna consciousness, his real
life actually begins. This Krsna consciousness movement is giving all
wandering living entities a chance to take to the shelter of Krsna and thus
become happy.

In this verse the words vimana iva are very significant. In this material
world even the great King of heaven is also full of anxiety. If even Lord
Brahma is full of anxiety, what of these ordinary living entities who are
working within this planet? Bhagavad-gita confirms:

abrahma-bhuvanal lokah
punar avartino ‘rjuna
“From the highest planet in the material world down to the lowest, all are
places of misery wherein repeated birth and death take place.” (Bg. 8.16)
In the material world a living entity is never satisfied. Even in the position
of Brahma or in the position of Indra or Candra, one is full of anxiety
simply because he has accepted this material world as a place of happiness.

objects for sense enjoyment; kamayamanah—desiring; asau—that King;

TRANSLATION

King Purarjana had unlimited desires for sense enjoyment; consequently
he traveled all over the world to find a place where all his desires could be
fulfilled. Unfortunately he found a feeling of insufficiency everywhere.

PURPORT
Srila Vidyapati, a great Vaisnava poet, has sung:
tatala saikate, varibindu-sama,
suta-mita-ramani-samaje

Material sense gratification, with society, friendship and love, is herein
compared to a drop of water falling on a desert. A desert requires oceans
of water to satisfy it, and if only a drop of water is supplied, what is its use?
Similarly, the living entity is part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, who, as stated in the Vedanta-sittra, is anandamayo ’bhyasat,
full of enjoyment. Being part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, the living entity is also seeking complete enjoyment. However,
complete enjoyment cannot be achieved separate from the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. In his wanderings in the different species of life,
the living entity may taste some type of enjoyment in one body or another,
but full enjoyment of the senses cannot be obtained in any material body.
Thus Puraiijana, the living entity, wanders in different types of bodies
but everywhere meets frustration in his attempt to enjoy. In other words,
the spiritual spark covered by matter cannot fully enjoy the senses in any
circumstance in material life. A deer may become absorbed in the musical
sounds vibrated by the hunter, but the result is that it loses its life.
Similarly, a fish is very expert in gratifying its tongue, but when it eats the
bait offered by the fisherman, it loses its life. Even the elephant, who is so
strong, is captured and loses its independence while satisfying its genitals
with a female elephant. In each and every species of life, the living entity
gets a body to satisfy various senses, but he cannot enjoy all his senses at
one time. In the human form of life he gets an opportunity to enjoy all his
senses pervertedly, but the result is that he becomes so harassed in his
attempted sense gratification that he ultimately becomes morose. As he
tries to satisfy his senses more and more, he becomes more and more
entangled.

TRANSLATION

Once while wandering in this way, he saw on the southern side of the
Himalayas, in a place named Bharata-varsa [India], a city that had nine
gates all about and was characterized by all auspicious facilities.

PURPORT

The tract of land south of the Himalayan Mountains is the land of India,
which was known as Bharata-varsa. When a living entity takes birth in
Bharata-varsa he is considered to be most fortunate. Indeed, Caitanya
Mahaprabhu has stated:

bharata-bhimite haila manusya-janma yara
10717710 sarthaka kari’ kara para-upakara
(Ce. Adi 9.41)

Thus whoever takes birth in the land of Bharata-varsa attains all the
facilities of life. He may take advantage of all these facilities for both
material and spiritual advancement and thus make his life successful. After
attaining the goal of life, one may distribute his knowledge and experience
all over the world for humanitarian purposes. In other words, one who takes
birth in the land of Bharata-varga by virtue of his past pious activities gets
full facility to develop the human form of life. In India, the climatic
condition is such that one can live very peacefully without being disturbed
by material conditions. Indeed, during the time of Maharaja Yudhisthira
or Lord Ramacandra, people were free from all anxieties. There was not


--- Page 20 ---
1152 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 25
even extreme cold or extreme heat. The three kinds of miserable
conditions—adhyatmika, adhibhautika, adhidaivika (miseries inflicted by
the body and mind itself, those inflicted by other living entities, and
natural disturbances)—were all absent during the reign of Lord Ramacandra
or Maharaja Yudhisthira. But at present, compared to other countries on
earth, India is artificially disturbed. Despite these material disturbances,
however, the country’s culture is such that one can easily attain the goal of
life—namely salvation, or liberation from material bondage. Thus in order
to take birth in India one must perform many pious activities in a past life.

In this verse the word laksita-laksapam indicates that the human body
attained in Bharata-varsa is very auspicious. Vedic culture is full of knowl-
edge, and a person born in India can fully take advantage of Vedic cultural
knowledge and the cultural system known as varpasrama-dharma. Even at
the present time, as we travel all over the world, we see that in some
countries human beings have many material facilities but no facilities for
spiritual advancement. We find everywhere the defects of one-sided
facilities and a lack of full facilities. A blind man can walk but not see, and
a lame man cannot walk but can see. Andha-panigu-nyaya. The blind man
may take the lame man over his shoulder, and as he walks the lame man
may give him directions. Thus combined they may work, but individually
neither the blind man nor the lame man can walk successfully. Similarly,
this human form of life is meant for the advancement of spiritual life and
for keeping the material necessities in order. Especially in the Western
countries there are ample facilities for material comforts, but no one has
any idea of spiritual advancement. Many are hankering after spiritual
advancement, but many cheaters come, take advantage of their money,
bluff them and go away. Fortunately the Krsna consciousness movement
is there to give all facilities for both material and spiritual advancement.
In this way people in the Western countries may take advantage of this
movement, and in India any man in the villages, unaffected by the indus-
trial cities of India, can still live in any condition and make spiritual
advancement.

The body has been called the city of nine gates, and these nine gates
include two eyes, two ears, two nostrils, one mouth, a genital and a rectum.
When the nine gates are clean and working properly, it is to be understood
that the body is healthy. In India these nine gates are kept clean by the
villagers who rise early in the morning, bathe in the well or rivers, go to the
temples to attend mangalarati, chant the Hare Krsna maha-mantra and
take prasada. In this way one can take advantage of all the facilities of
human life. We are gradually introducing this system in different centers


--- Page 21 ---
Text 14] The Characteristics of King Puraiijana 1153
in our society in the Western countries. One who takes advantage of it
becomes more and more enlightened in spiritual life. At the present
moment, India may be compared to the lame man and the Western
countries to the blind man. For the past two thousand years India has
been subjugated to the rule of foreigners, and the legs of progress have
been broken. In the Western countries the eyes of the people have become
blind due to the dazzling glitter of material opulence. The blind man of the
Western countries and the lame man of India should combine together in
this Krsna consciousness movement. Then the lame man of India can walk
with the help of the Westerner, and the blind Westerner can see with the
help of the lame man. In short, the material advancement of the Western
countries and the spiritual assets of India should combine for the elevation
of all human society.

That city was surrounded by walls and parks, and within it were towers,

PURPORT
The body is protected by walls of skin. The hairs on the body are com-
pared to parks, and the highest parts of the body, like the nose and head,
are compared to towers. The wrinkles and depressions on different parts
of the body are compared to trenches or canals, the eyes are compared to

windows, and the eyelids are compared to protective gates. The three
types of metal—gold, silver and iron—represent the three modes of material
nature. Gold represents goodness, silver passion, and iron ignorance. The
body is also sometimes considered to be a bag containing three elements
(tri-dhatu): mucus, bile and air (kapha, pitta and vayu). Yasydatma-buddhih
kunape tri-dhatuke (Bhag. 10.84.13). According to Bhdgavatam, one who
considers this bag of mucus, bile and air to be the self is considered no
better than a cow or an ass.

PURPORT
In the city of the body, the heart is considered to be the capital. Just as
the capital of a state is especially gorgeously filled with various high
buildings and lustrous palaces, the heart of the body is filled with various
desires and plans for material enjoyment. Such plans are sometimes com-
pared to valuable jewels such as sapphires, rubies, pearls and emeralds. The
heart becomes the center for all planning for material enjoyment.

TRANSLATION
In that city there were many assembly houses, street crossings, streets,
restaurants, gambling houses, markets, resting places, flags, festoons and
beautiful parks. All these surrounded the city.
PURPORT
In this way the capital is described. In the capital there are assembly
houses and many squares, many street crossings, avenues and streets,
many gambling places, markets and places of rest, all decorated with
flags and festoons. The squares are surrounded with railings and are devoid
of trees. The heart of the body can be compared to the assembly house, for
the living entity is within the heart along with the Paramatma, as stated in
Bhagavad-gita:
sarvasya caham hrdi sannivisto
mattah smrtir jiagnam apohanam ca
vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyo
vedanta-krd veda-vid eva caham
“I am seated in everyone's heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowl-
edge and forgetfulness. By all the Vedas am I to be known; indeed I am
the compiler of Vedanta, and I am the knower of the Vedas.” (Bg. 15.15)
The heart is the center of all remembrance, forgetfulness and deliberation.
In the body the eyes, ears and nose are different places of attraction for
sense enjoyment, and the streets for going hither and thither may be com-
pared to different types of air blowing within the body. The yogic process
for controlling the air within the body and the different nerves is called
susumna, the path of liberation. The body is also a resting place because
when the living entity becomes fatigued he takes rest within the body.
The palms and soles of the feet are compared to flags and festoons.

TRANSLATION
On the outskirts of that city were many beautiful trees and creepers
encircling a nice lake. Also surrounding that lake were many groups of
birds and bees that were always chanting and humming.
PURPORT
Since the body is a great city, there must be various arrangements such
as lakes and gardens for sense enjoyment. Of the various parts of the body,
those which incite sexual impulses are referred to here indirectly. Because
the body has genitals, when the living entity attains the right age—be he
man or woman—he becomes agitated by the sex impulse. As long as one
remains a child, he is not agitated by seeing a beautiful woman. Although
the sense organs are present, unless the age is ripe there is no sex impulse.
The favorable conditions surrounding the sex impulse are compared here
to a garden or a nice solitary park. When one sees the opposite sex, naturally
the sex impulse increases. It is said that if a man in a solitary place does
not become agitated upon seeing a woman, he is to be considered a
brahmacdri. But this practice is almost impossible. The sex impulse is so
strong that even by seeing, touching or talking, coming into contact with,
or even thinking of the opposite sex—even in so many subtle ways—one
becomes sexually impelled. Consequently a brahmacari or sannydsi is
prohibited to associate with women, especially in a secret place. The sdstras
enjoin that one should not even talk to a woman in a secret place, even if
she happens to be one’s own daughter, sister or mother. The sex impulse is


--- Page 25 ---
Text 19] The Characteristics of King Puraiijana 1157
so strong that even if one is very learned, he becomes agitated in such
circumstances. If this is the case, how can a young man in a nice park
remain calm and quiet after seeing a beautiful young woman?

TRANSLATION
The branches of the trees standing on the bank of the lake received
particles of water carried by the spring air from the falls coming down from
the icy mountain.
PURPORT
In this verse the word hima-nirjhara is particularly significant. The
waterfall represents a kind of liquid humor or rasa (relationship). In the
body there are different types of humor, rasa or mellow. The supreme
mellow (relationship) is called the sexual mellow (adi-rasa). When this
adi-rasa or sex desire comes in contact with the spring air moved by Cupid,
it becomes agitated. In other words, all these are representations of ripa,
rasa, gandha, sabda and sparsa. The wind is sparsa, or touch. The waterfall
is rasa, or taste. The spring air (kusumadkara) is smell. All these varieties
of enjoyment make life very pleasing, and thus we become captivated by
material existence.

In such an atmosphere even the animals of the forest became nonviolent
and nonenvious like great sages. Consequently the animals did not attack
anyone. Over and above everything was the cooing of the cuckoos. Any
passenger passing along that path was invited by that atmosphere to take
rest in that nice garden.
PURPORT
A peaceful family with wife and children is compared to the peaceful
atmosphere of the forest. Children are compared to nonviolent animals.
Sometimes, however, wives and children are called svajandkhya-dasyu,
burglars in the name of kinsmen. A man earns his livelihood with hard
labor, but the result is that he is plundered by his wife and children exactly
as a person in a forest is attacked by some thieves and burglars who take
his money. Nonetheless in family life the turmoil of wife and children
appears to be like the cooing of the cuckoos in the garden of family life.
Being invited by such an atmosphere, the person who is passing through
such a blissful family life desires to have his family with him at all costs.

While wandering here and there in that wonderful garden, King Puranjana
suddenly came in contact with a very beautiful woman who was walking
there without any engagement. She had ten servants with her, and each
servant had hundreds of wives accompanying him.
PURPORT
The body has already been compared to a beautiful garden. During youth
the sex impulse is awakened, and the intelligence, according to one’s
imagination, is prone to contact the opposite sex. In youth a man or woman
is in search of the opposite sex by intelligence or imagination, if not
directly. The intelligence influences the mind, and the mind controls the
ten senses. Five of these senses gather knowledge, and five work directly.
Each sense has many desires to be fulfilled. This is the position of the
body and the owner of the body, puraiijana, who is within the body.

1160 Srimad- Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 25
PURPORT

The vital force of a living entity includes the five kinds of air working
within the body, which are known as prapa, apana, vyana, samana, and
udana. The vital force is compared to a serpent because a serpent can live
by simply drinking air. The vital force carried by the air is described as the
pratihara, or the bodyguard. Without the vital force one cannot live for a
moment. Indeed, all the senses are working under the protection of the
vital force.

The woman, who represents intelligence, was searching after a husband.
This indicates that intelligence cannot act without consciousness. A
beautiful woman is useless unless protected by the proper husband. Intelli-
gence must always be very fresh; therefore the word apraudha (very
young) is used here. Material enjoyment means utilizing the intelligence
for the sake of 7810৫, rasa, gandha, sabda and sparsa, or form, taste, smell,
sound and touch.

were equally very beautiful and were bedecked with dazzling earrings.
PURPORT

The body of intelligence enjoys the objects of sense gratification that
cover it, such as smell, vision and hearing. The word sundasam (beautiful
nose) indicates the organ for acquiring knowledge by smell. Similarly, the

mouth is the instrument for acquiring knowledge by taste, for by chewing
an object and touching it with the tongue we can understand its taste. The
word sukapolam (nice forehead) indicates a clear brain capable of under-
standing things as they are. By intelligence one can set things in order. The
earrings set upon the two ears are placed there by the work of the intelli-
gence. Thus the ways of acquiring knowledge are described metaphorically.

TRANSLATION
With the end of her sari the woman was trying to cover her breasts,
which were equally round and well-placed side by side. She again and
again tried to cover them out of shyness while she walked exactly like a
great elephant.
PURPORT
The two breasts represent attachment and envy. The symptoms of raga
and dvesa (attachment and envy) are described in Bhagavad-gita:
indriyasyendriyasydrthe
raga-dvesau vyavasthitau
tayor na vasam agacchet
tau hy asya paripanthinau
“Attraction and repulsion for sense objects are felt by embodied beings,
but one should not fall under the control of senses and sense objects because
they are stumbling blocks on the path of self-realization.”” (Bg. 3.34)
These representatives of attachment and envy are very much unfavorable
for advancement in spiritual life. One should not be attracted by the breasts
of young women. The great saint Sarikaracarya has described the breasts of
women, especially young women, as nothing but a combination of muscles
and blood, so one should not be attracted by the illusory energy of raised
breasts with nipples. They are agents of mdyd meant to victimize the
opposite sex. Because the breasts are equally attractive, they are described
as sama-vrttau. The sex impulse remains in an old man’s heart also, even
up to the point of death. To be rid of such agitation, one must be very
much advanced in spiritual consciousness, like Yamunacarya, who said:
yadavadhi mama cetah krsna-padaravinde
nava-nava-rasa-dhamany udyatari rantum dsit
tadavadhi bata nari-sangame smaryamane
bhavati mukha-vikarah susthu nisthivanarm ca


--- Page 31 ---
Text 25] The Characteristics of King Puraiijana 1163
“Since I have been engaged in the transcendental loving service of Krsna,
realizing ever new pleasure in Him, whenever I think of sex pleasure, I spit
at the thought, and my lips curl with distaste.”

When one is spiritually advanced he can no longer be attracted by the
lumps of flesh and blood which are the breasts of young women. The word
nirantarau is significant because although the breasts are situated in different
locations, the action is the same. We should not make any distinction
between attachment and envy. As described in Bhagavad-gitd, they are both
products of rajo-guna:

ॐ bhagavan ८४९८०
kama esa krodha esa
rajoguna-samudbhavah
mahasano maha-papma
viddhy enam iha vairinam
“The Blessed Lord said: It is lust only, Arjuna, which is born of contact
with the material modes of passion and later transformed into wrath, and
which is the all-devouring, sinful enemy of this world.” (Bg. 3.37)

The word nigithantim (trying to cover) indicates that even if one is
tainted by kama, lobha, krodha, etc., they can be transfigured by Krsna
consciousness. In other words, one can utilize kama (lust) for serving Krsna.
Being impelled by lust, an ordinary worker will work hard day and night;
similarly a devotee can work hard day and night to satisfy Krsna. Just as
karmis are working hard to satisfy kama-krodha, a devotee should work in
the same way to satisfy Krsna. Similarly, krodha (anger) can also be used
in the service of Krsna when it is applied to the nondevotee demons.
Hanumanji applied his anger in this way. He was a great devotee of Lord
Ramacandra, and he utilized his anger to set fire to the kingdom of Ravana,
a nondevotee demon. Thus kama (lust) can be utilized to satisfy Krsna,
and krodha (anger) can be utilized to punish the demons. When both are
used for Krsna’s service, they lose their material significance and become
spiritually important.

TRANSLATION

Purarijana, the hero, became attracted by the eyebrows and smiling face
of the very beautiful girl and was immediately pierced by the arrows of her
lusty desires. When she smiled shyly, she looked very beautiful to Puraiijana,
who, although a hero, could not refrain from addressing her.

PURPORT

Every living entity is a hero in two ways. When he is a victim of the
illusory energy, he works as a great hero in the material world, as a great
leader, politician, businessman, industrialist, etc., and his heroic activities
contribute to the material advancement of civilization. One can also be-
come a hero by being master of the senses, a gosvami. Material activities are
false heroic activities, whereas restraining the senses from material engage-
ment is great heroism. However great a hero one may be in the material
world, he can be immediately conquered by the lumps of flesh and blood
known as the breasts of women. In the history of material activities there
are many examples, like the Roman hero Antony, who became captivated
by the beauty of Cleopatra. Similarly, a great hero in India named Bajirao
became a victim of a woman during the time of Maharastrian politics, and
he was defeated. From his story we understand that formerly politi-
cians used to employ beautiful girls who were trained as visa-kanya. These
girls had poison injected into their bodies from the beginning of their lives
so that in due course of time they would become so immune to the poison
and so poisonous themselves that simply by kissing a person they could
kill him. Thus these poisonous girls were engaged to see an enemy and kill
him with a kiss. Thus there are many instances in human history of heros
who have been curbed simply by women. Being part and parcel of Krsna,
the living entity is certainly a great hero, but due to his own weakness he
becomes attracted to the material features.

krsna-bahirmukha hana bhoga-vdaricha kare

--- Page 33 ---
Text 26] The Characteristics of King Puraiijana 1165
It is said in the Prema-vivarta that when a living entity wants to enjoy
material nature, he is immediately victimized by the material energy. A
living entity is not forced to come into the material world. He makes his
own choice, being attracted by beautiful women. Every living entity has
the freedom to be attracted by material nature or to stand as a hero and
resist that attraction. It is simply a question of the living entity’s being
attracted or not being attracted. There is no question of his being
forced to come into contact with material energy. One who can keep him-
self steady and resist the attraction of material nature is certainly a hero
and deserves to be called a gosvami. Unless one is master of the senses, he
cannot become a gosvami. The living entity can take one of two positions
in this world. He may become a servant of his senses or he may become
master of them. By becoming a servant of the senses, one becomes a great
material hero, and by becoming master of the senses, he becomes a gosvami,
or spiritual hero.

PURPORT
The first aphorism in the Vedanta-sitra is athato brahma-jijidsa. In the
human form of life one should put many questions to himself and to his
intelligence. In the various forms of life lower than human life the intelli-


--- Page 34 ---
1166 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 25
gence does not go beyond the range of life’s primary necessities—namely,
eating, sleeping, mating and defending. Dogs, cats and tigers are always
busy trying to find something to eat or a place to sleep, trying to defend
and have sexual intercourse successfully. In the human form of life, how-
ever, one should be intelligent enough to ask what he is, why he has come
into the world, what his duty is, who is the supreme controller, what is the
difference between dull matter and the living entity, etc. There are so many
questions, and the person who is actually intelligent should simply inquire
about the supreme source of everything: athdto brahma-jijiidsa. A living
entity is always connected with a certain amount of intelligence, but in
the human form of life the living entity must inquire about his spiritual
identity. This is real human intelligence. It is said that one who is simply
conscious of the body is no better than an animal, even though he be in
the human form. In Bhagavad-gita Sri Krsna says:

sarvasya caham hrdi sannivisto

mattah smrtir jianam apohanar ca
vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyo
vedanta-krd veda-vid eva caham
“I am seated in everyone’s heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowl-
edge and forgetfulness. By all the Vedas am I to be known; indeed 1 am
the compiler of Vedanta and I am the knower of the Vedas.” (Bg. 15.15)
In the animal form the living entity is completely forgetful of his relation-
ship with God. This is called apohanam, or forgetfulness. In the human
form of life, however, consciousness is more greatly developed, and conse-
quently the human being has a chance to understand his relationship with
God. In the human form one should utilize his intelligence by asking all
these questions, just as Purarijana, the living entity, is asking the unknown
girl where she has come from, what her business is, why she is present, etc.
These are inquiries about atma-tattva—self-realization. The conclusion is
that unless a living entity is inquisitive about self-realization he is nothing
but an animal.

My dear lotus-eyed, who are those eleven strong bodyguards with you,
and who are those ten specific servants? Who are those women following
the ten servants, and who is the snake that is preceding you?
PURPORT =
The ten strong servants of the mind are the five working senses and the
five knowledge- gathering senses. All these ten senses work under the aegis
of the mind. The mind and the ten senses combine to become eleven strong
bodyguards. The hundreds of women under the jurisdiction of the senses
are addressed here as 1८107162. The mind works under the intelligence, and
under the mind are the ten senses, and under the ten senses are innumer-
able desires to be fulfilled. All these, however, depend on the vital life
force, which is here represented by the snake. As long as the vital life force
is there, the mind works, and under the mind the senses work, and the
senses give rise to so many material desires. Actually the living entity,
known as purafijana, is embarrassed by so much paraphernalia. All this
paraphernalia simply constitutes different sources of anxiety, but one who
is surrendered unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who leaves all
business to Him, is freed from such anxieties. Therefore Prahlada Maharaja
advises a person who has taken to the materialistic way of life, which is
never permanent but always temporary, to take shelter of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead and leave aside all his so-called responsibilities in
order to get free from all anxieties.

My dear beautiful girl, you are exactly like the goddess of fortune, or the
wife of Lord Siva, or the goddess of learning, the wife of Lord Brahma.
Although you must be one of them, I see that you are loitering in this
forest. Indeed, you are as silent as the great sages. Is it that you are search-
ing after your own husband? Whoever your husband may be, simply by
understanding that you are so faithful to him, he will come to possess all
opulences. I think you must be the goddess of fortune, but I do not see the
lotus flower in your hand. Therefore I am asking you where you have
thrown that lotus.

PURPORT

Everyone thinks that his intelligence is perfect. Sometimes one employs
his intelligence in the worship of Uma, the wife of Lord Siva, in order to
obtain a beautiful wife. Sometimes, when one wants to become as learned
as Lord Brahma, he employs his intelligence in the worship of the goddess
of learning, Sarasvati. Sometimes, when one wishes to become as opulent
as Lord Vignu,he worships the goddess of fortune, Laksmi. In this verse all
these inquiries are made by King Purahjana, the living entity who is bewil-
dered and does not know how to employ his intelligence. Intelligence
should be employed in the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
As soon as one uses his intelligence in this way, the goddess of fortune
automatically becomes favorable to him. The goddess of fortune, Laksmi,
never remains without her husband, Lord Visnu. Consequently, when one
worships Lord Visnu he automatically obtains the favor of the goddess of
fortune. One should not, like Ravana, worship the goddess of fortune alone,
for she cannot remain long without her husband. Thus her other name is


--- Page 37 ---
Text 29] The Characteristics of King Purajana 1169
Caricala, or restless. In this verse it is clear that Puraiijana is representing
our intelligence while he is talking with the girl. He not only appreciated
the shyness of the girl, but he actually became more and more attracted by
that shyness. He was actually thinking of becoming her husband and con-
sequently was asking her whether she was thinking of her prospective
husband or whether she was married. This is an example of bhoga-iccha—
the desire for enjoyment. One who is attracted by such desires becomes
conditioned in this material world, and one who is not so attracted attains
liberation. King Purafijana was appreciating the beauty of the girl as if she
were the goddess of fortune, but at the same time he was careful to under-
stand that the goddess of fortune cannot be enjoyed by anyone except
Lord Visnu. Since he doubted whether the girl was the goddess of fortune,
he inquired about the lotus flower she was not holding. The material world
is also the goddess of fortune because the material energy works under the
direction of Lord Visnu. As stated in Bhagavad-gitd:
mayadhyaksena prakrtih
sityate sa-caracaram
hetundnena kaunteya
Jjagad viparivartate

“This material nature is working under My direction, O son of Kunti, and
it is producing all moving and unmoving beings. By its rule this manifesta-
tion is created and annihilated again and again.” (Bg. 9.10)

The material world cannot be enjoyed by any living entity. If one so
desires to enjoy it, he immediately becomes a demon like Ravana,
Hiranyakasipu or Kamsa. Because Ravana wanted to enjoy the goddess of
fortune, Sitadevi, he was vanquished with all his family, wealth and opu-
lence. One can, however, enjoy that maya bestowed upon the living entity
by Lord Visnu. The satisfaction of one’s senses and desires means enjoying
maya, not the goddess of fortune.

TRANSLATION

O greatly fortunate one, it appears that you are none of the women I
have mentioned because I see that your feet are touching the ground. But
if you are some woman of this planet, you can, like the goddess of fortune
who, accompanied by Lord Visnu, increases the beauty of the Vaikuntha
planets, also increase the beauty of this city by associating with me. You
should understand that I am a great hero and a very powerful king on this
planet.

PURPORT

There is a difference between demoniac mentality and devotional
mentality. Devotees know perfectly well that the goddess of fortune, who
is the constant companion of Visnu or Narayana, cannot be enjoyed by a
living entity. This higher sense of understanding is called Krsna conscious-
ness. Nonetheless, everyone wants to become happy by imitating the
prosperity of Narayana. In this verse Purafijana states that the girl appears
to be an ordinary woman. However, since he is attracted by her, he requests
that she become as happy as the goddess of fortune by associating with
him. Thus he introduces himself as a great king with great influence so that
she might accept him as her husband and be as happy as the goddess of
fortune. To desire to enjoy this material world as a subordinate of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead is godly. The demons, however, want to
enjoy this material world without considering the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. This is the difference between a demon and 8 demigod.

The word bhuvi-sprk mentioned in this verse is very significant. When
the demigodssometimes come to this planet, they do not touch the ground.
Purarijana could understand that this girl did not belong to the transcenden-
tal world or the higher planetary system because her feet were touching


--- Page 39 ---
Text 30] The Characteristics of King Purafjana 1171
the ground. Since every woman in this world wants her husband to be very
influential, rich and powerful, Purafijana, to seduce the girl, introduced
himself as such a personality. In the material world, whether one be a man
or a woman, one wants to enjoy. A man wants to enjoy a beautiful woman,
and a woman wants to enjoy a powerful, opulent man. Every living entity
who possesses such material desires is called purusa, an enjoyer. Super-
ficially it appears that the woman is the enjoyed and the man is the enjoyer,
but internally everyone is an enjoyer. Consequently everything in this
material world is called maya.

Everyone has lusty desires within, and as soon as one is agitated by the
movement of a beautiful woman’s eyebrows, the cupid within immediately

1172 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 25
throws his arrow at the heart. Thus one is quickly conquered by the eye-
brows of a beautiful woman. When one is agitated by lusty desires, his
senses are attracted by all kinds of visaya (enjoyable things like sound,
touch, form, smell and taste). These attractive sense objects oblige one to
come under the control of a woman. In this way the conditional life of a
living entity begins. Conditional life means being under the control of a
woman, and certainly the living entity is always at the mercy of a woman
or a man. Thus living entities live in bondage to one another, and thus they
continue this conditional material life illusioned by maya.

PURPORT
Such a speech is typical of a living entity attracted by the opposite sex.
This is called bewilderment occasioned by becoming conditioned by


--- Page 41 ---
Text 32] The Characteristics of King Puraiijana 1173
material nature. When thus attracted by the beauty of the material energy,
one becomes very eager to enjoy. This is elaborately described in this
instance of Puraijana’s becoming attracted by the beautiful woman. In
conditional life the living entity is attracted by a face, eyebrows, or eyes,
a voice or anything. In short, everything becomes attractive. When a man
or a woman is attracted by the opposite sex, it doesn’t matter whether
the opposite sex is beautiful or not. The lover sees everything beautiful in
the face of the beloved and thus becomes attracted. This attraction causes
the living entity to fall down in this material world. This is described in
Bhagavad-gita:
iccha-dvesa-samutthena
dvandva-mohena bharata
sarva-bhitani sarhmohani
sarge ydnti parantapa
“O scion of Bharata [Arjuna], O conquerer of the foe, all living entities
are born into delusion, overcome by the dualities of desire and hate.”
(Bg. 7.27)

This condition of life is called avidya. Opposed to this avidya is real
knowledge. Sri [sopanisad distinguishes between vidyd and avidya, knowl-
edge and ignorance. By avidyd (ignorance) one becomes conditioned, and
by vidya (knowledge) one becomes liberated. Purainjana admits herein that
he is attracted by avidyd. Now he wishes to see the complete feature of
avidyd and so requests the girl to raise her head so that he can see her face
to face. He thus wishes to see the various features that make avidya
attractive.

By this incident we can understand that when a man is aggressive and
begins to woo a woman, the woman becomes attracted to the man. This
process is described in the Bhagavatam as pumsah striya mithuni-bhavam
etam (Bhag. 5.5.8). This attraction is enacted on the platform of sexual
life. Thus the sex impulse is the platform of material engagement. This
conditional life, the platform of material sense enjoyment, is the cause of
forgetfulness of spiritual life. In this way a living entity’s original Krsna
consciousness becomes covered or converted into material consciousness.
Thus one engages in the business of sense gratification.

Text 34] The Characteristics of King Purafjana 1175
PURPORT

The living entity is ignorant of his origin. He does not know why this
material world was created, why others are working in this material world,
and what the ultimate source of this manifestation is. No one knows the
answers to these questions, and this is called ignorance. By researching into
the origin of life, important scientists are finding some chemical composi-
tions or cellular combinations, but actually no one knows the original
source of life within this material world. The phrase brahma-jijiidsa is used
to indicate an inquisitiveness to know the original source of our existence
in this material world. No philosopher, scientist or politician actually knows
wherefrom we have come, why we are here struggling so hard for existence
and where we will go. Generally people are of the opinion that we are all
here accidently and that as soon as these bodies are finished all our dramatic
activities will be finished and we will become zero. Such scientists and
philosophers are impersonalists and voidists. In this verse the girl is express-
ing the actual position of the living entity. She cannot tell Puraijana her
father’s name because she does not know from where she has come. Nor
does she know why she is present in that place. She frankly said that she
did not know anything about all this. This is the position of the living
entity in the material world. There are so many scientists, philosophers and
big leaders, but they do not know wherefrom they have come, nor do they
know why they are busy within this material world to obtain a position of
so-called happiness. In this material world we have many nice facilities for
living, but we are so foolish that we do not ask who has made this world
habitable for us and has arranged it so nicely. Everything is functioning in
order, but people foolishly think that they are produced by chance in this
material world and that after death they will become zero. They think that
this beautiful place of habitation will automatically remain.

PURPORT
This lack of Krsna consciousness is called ignorance. In Srimad-
Bhagavatam it is called parabhavas tavad abodha-jatah ( Bhag. 5.5.5.).
Everyone is born ignorant. The Bhagavatam therefore says that we are all
born ignorant within this material world. In our ignorance we may create
nationalism, philanthropy, internationalism, science, philosophy and so
many other things. The basic principle behind all these is ignorance. What
then is the value of all this advancement of knowledge if the basic principle
is ignorance? Unless a person comes to Krsna consciousness, all of his
activities are defeated. This human form of life is especially meant to
dissipate ignorance, but without understanding how to dissipate ignorance
people are planning and building many things. After death, however, all of
this is finished.

Text 36] The Characteristics of King Puraiijana 1177
PURPORT

Puraiijana inquired from the woman about those eleven men and their
wives as well as the snake. The woman gave a brief description of them. She
was obviously without full knowledge of her surrounding men and women
and the snake. As stated before, the snake is the vital force of the living
being. This vital force always remains awake even when the body and the
senses become fatigued and do no work. Even in the state of unconscious-
ness, when we sleep, the snake or the life force remains intact and awake.
Consequently we dream when we sleep. When the living entity gives up this
material body, the vital force still remains intact and is carried to another
material body. That is called transmigration, or change of the body, and
we have come to know this process as death. Actually, there is no death. The
vital force always exists with the soul, and when the soul is awakened from
so-called sleep, he can see his eleven friends, or the active senses and the
mind with their various desires (wives). The vital life force remains. Even
during our sleeping hours we can understand by virtue of our breathing
process that the snake lives by eating the air that passes within this body.
Air is exhibited in the form of breathing, and as long as breath is there, one
can understand that a sleeping man is alive. Thus even when the gross body
is asleep the vital force remains active and alive to protect the body. Thus
the snake is described as living and eating air to keep the body fit for life.

PURPORT

The living entity comes down into this material world for sense gratifica-
tion, and his intelligence, represented by the woman, gives him the proper
direction by which he can satisfy his senses to their best capacity. In
actuality, however, intelligence comes from the Supersoul, or the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, and He gives full facility to the living entity who
has come down to this material world. As stated in Bhagavad-gita:

vyavasayatmika buddhir
ekeha kuru-nandana
bahu-sakhd hy anantas ca
buddhayo ’vyavasayinam
“Those who are on this path are resolute in purpose, and their aim is one.
O beloved child of the Kurus, the intelligence of those who are irresolute is
many-branched.” (Bg. 2.41)

When a devotee is advancing toward spiritual realization, his only aim is
the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He doesn’t care for any
other material or spiritual activity. King Purarijana represents the ordinary
living entity, and the woman represents the ordinary living entity’s intelli-
gence. Combined, the living entity enjoys his material senses, and the
intelligence supplies all paraphernalia for his enjoyment. As soon as he
enters the human form, the living entity is entrapped by a family tradition,
nationality, customs, etc. These are all supplied by the maya of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Thus the living entity, under the bodily concep-
tion of life, utilizes his intelligence to his best capacity in order to satisfy
his senses.

PURPORT

Dharmartha-kama-moksanarh dharah samprapti-hetavah. The wife is the
cause of all kinds of success in religion, economic development, sense
gratification, and ultimately salvation. When one accepts a wife, it is to be
understood that he is being helped in his progressive march toward libera-
tion. In the beginning of life a person is trained 88 a brahmacari and is then
allowed to marry a suitable girl and become a householder. If one is
thoroughly trained in household life, he finds all facilities for human life—
eating, sleeping, mating and defending. Everything is there if it is executed
according to regulative principles.

Such foolish persons are like animals because they do not know the process

PURPORT

Since there are 8,400,000 species of life, there are also many different
living conditions. In the lower grades of life (in plant and tree life) there is
no system for sexual intercourse. In the upper grades (in the life of birds
and bees) there is sex, but the insects and animals do not know how to
actually enjoy sex life. In the human form of life, however, there is full
knowledge of how to enjoy sex. Indeed, there are many so-called philoso-
phers who give directions on how to enjoy sex life. There is even a science
called kama-sastra, which is the science of sex. In human life there are also
such divisions as brahmacarya, grhastha, vanaprastha, and sannydsa. There
is no sex life except in the grhastha or householder asrama. The brahmacari
is not allowed any sex, a vanaprastha voluntarily refrains from sex, and the
sannydsi is completely renounced. The karmis do not practice brahmacarya,
vanaprastha or sannydsa life, for they are very much interested in grhastha
life. In other words, a human being is very much materially inclined. Indeed,
all living entities are materially inclined. They prefer grhastha life because
there is concession for sex. The karmis think the other statuses of life are
worse than animal life, for animals also have sex, whereas the brahmacart,
vanaprastha and sannydsi completely give up sex. The karmis, therefore,
abhor these orders of spiritual life.

TRANSLATION

The woman continued: In this material world, a householder’s life brings
all kinds of happiness in religion, economic development, sense gratifica-
tion and in the begetting of children, sons and grandsons. After that, one
may desire liberation as well as material reputation. The householder can
appreciate the results of sacrifices, which enable him to gain promotion to
superior planetary systems. All this material happiness is practically un-
known to the transcendentalists. They cannot even imagine such happiness.

PURPORT

According to Vedic instructions, there are two paths for human activi
ties. One is called pravrtti-marga, and the other is called nivrtti-marga. The
basic principle for either of these paths is religious life. In animal life there
is only pravrtti-mdarga. Pravrtti-marga means sense enjoyment, and nivr¢ti-
mdrga means spiritual advancement. In the life of animals and demons,
there is no conception of nivrtti-mdrga, nor is there any actual conception
of pravrtti-mdrga. Pravrtti-mdrga maintains that even though one has the
propensity for sense gratification, he can gratify his senses according to the
directions of the Vedic injunctions. For example, everyone has the pro-
pensity for sex life, but in demoniac civilization sex is enjoyed without
restriction. According to Vedic culture, sex is enjoyed under Vedic instruc-
tions. Thus the Vedas give direction to civilized human beings to enable
them to satisfy their propensities for sense gratification.

In the nivrtti-marga, however, on the path of transcendental realization,
sex is completely forbidden. The social orders are divided into four parts—
brahmacarya, grhastha, vanaprastha and sannyasa—and only in the house-
holder life can the pravrtti-marga be encouraged or accepted according to
Vedic instructions. In the orders of brahmacarya, vanaprastha and sannyasa,
there are no facilities for sex.

In this verse the woman is advocating pravrtti-marga only and is dis-
couraging the path of nivrtti-mdarga. She clearly says that the yatis, the
transcendentalists who are concerned only with spiritual life (kaivalya),
cannot imagine the happiness of pravrtti-marga. In other words, the man
who follows the Vedic principles enjoys the materialistic way of life not
only by becoming happy in this life, but also in the next life by being
promoted to the heavenly planets. In this life such a person gets all kinds
of material opulences, such as sons and grandsons, because he is always
engaged in various religious functions. The material distresses are birth, old
age, disease and death, but those who are interested in pravrtti-marga hold


--- Page 50 ---
1182 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 25
various religious functions at the time of birth, old age, disease and death.
Without caring for the distresses of birth, old age, disease and death, they
are addicted to performing the special functions according to the Vedic
ritualistic ceremonies.

Factually, however, pravrtti-marga is based on sex life. As stated in
Srimad-Bhagavatam, yan maithunddi- grhamedhi-sukhari hi tuccham
(Bhag. 7.9.45). A householder who is too much addicted to pravrtti-marga
is actually called a grhamedhi, not a grhastha. Although the grhastha desires
sense gratification, he acts according to Vedic instructions. The grhamedhi,
however, who is interested only in sense gratification, does not follow any
Vedic instruction. The grhamedhi engages himself as an advocate of sex life
and also allows his sons and daughters to engage in sex and to be deprived
of any glorious end in life. A grhastha enjoys sex life in this life as well as
in the next, but a grhamedhi does not know what the next life is about
because he is simply interested in sex in this life. ®n the whole, when one is
too much inclined towards sex, he does not care for the transcendental
spiritual life. In this age of Kali especially, no one is interested in spiritual
advancement. Even though it is sometimes found that one may be interested
in spiritual advancement, he is most likely to accept a bogus method of
spiritual life, being misguided by so many pretenders.

sages, saintly persons and everyone else. A householder life is thus
beneficial.
PURPORT

According to the Vedic system, when one is born in this material world
he has many obligations. He has obligations to the demigods—the demigods
of the sun and moon, King Indra, Varuna, etc.—because they are supplying
the necessities of life. We receive heat, light, water and all other natural
amenities through the mercy of the demigods. We are also indebted to our
forefathers who have given us these bodies, paternal property, intelligence,
society, friendship and love. Similarly, we are indebted to the general
public for politics and sociology, and we are also indebted to lower animals
such as horses, cows, asses, dogs and cats. In this way, as soon as one is born
in this material world as a human being, he has so many obligations and is
bound to repay all these obligations. If he does not repay them, he is
further entangled in the process of birth and death. The grhamedht,
however, who is overly addicted to material things, does not know that
if he simply takes shelter at the lotus feet of Mukunda, he is
immediately freed from all obligations to others. Unfortunately a
grhamedhi does not have any interest in Krsna consciousness. Prahlada
Maharaja says: matir na krspe paratah svato va mitho ’bhipadyeta grha-
vratanam (Bhag. 7.5.30). A grhavrata is the same as a grhamedhi. One who
takes sex life to be supreme finds action in Krsna consciousness confusing.
Either due to his own personal consideration, or due to his having taken
instructions from others or conferring with them, he becomes addicted
to sexual indulgence and cannot act in Krsna consciousness.

1184 Srimad-Bhagavatam [ Canto 4, Ch. 25
TRANSLATION

0 my dear hero, who in this world will not accept a husband like you?

You are so famous, so magnanimous, so beautiful and so easily gotten.
PURPORT

Every husband is certainly a great hero to his wife. In other words, if a
woman loves a man, that man appears very beautiful and magnanimous.
Unless one becomes beautiful in the eyes of another, one cannot dedicate
his whole life to another. The husband is considered very magnanimous
because he gives as many children to the wife as she likes. Every woman is
fond of children; therefore any husband who can please his wife by sex and
give her children is considered very magnanimous. Not only does the
husband become magnanimous by begetting children, but by giving his
wife ornaments, nice food and dresses, he keeps her completely under
submission. Such a satisfied wife will never give up the company of her
husband. Manu-sarnhitd recommends that to keep a wife satisfied a husband
should give her some ornaments because women are generally fond of home,
ornaments, dresses, children, etc. In this way the woman is the center of
all material enjoyment.

In this regard, the word vikhydtam is very significant. A man is always
famous for his aggression toward a beautiful woman, and such aggression
is sometimes considered rape. Although rape is not legally allowed, it is
a fact that a woman likes a man who is very expert at rape.

TRANSLATION

O mighty-armed, who in this world will not be attracted by your arms,
which are just like the bodies of serpents? Actually you relieve the distress
of husbandless women like us by your attractive smile and your aggressive
mercy. We think that you are traveling on the surface of the earth just to
benefit us only.

PURPORT

When a husbandless woman is attacked by an aggressive man, she takes
his action to be mercy. A woman is generally very much attracted by a
man’s long arms. A serpent’s body is round, and it becomes narrower and
thinner at the end. The beautiful arms of a man appear to a woman just
like serpents, and they very much desire to be embraced by such arms.

The word andtha-varga is very significant in this verse. Natha means
husband, and ৫ means without. A young woman who has no husband is
called anatha, meaning one who is not protected. As soon as a woman
attains the age of puberty, she immediately becomes very much agitated
by sexual desire. It is therefore the duty of the father to get his daughter
married before she attains puberty. Otherwise she will be very much
mortified by not having a husband. Anyone who satisfies her desire for
sex at that age becomes a great object of satisfaction. It is a psychological
fact that when a woman at the age of puberty meets a man and the man
satisfies her sexually, she will love that man for the rest of her life, regardless
who he is. Thus so-called love within this material world is nothing but
sexual satisfaction.

The great sage Narada continued: My dear King, those two—the man

PURPORT
One hundred years is significant in this connection because every human
being 18 given the concession to live up to a hundred years. The span of life
is different on different planets, according to the planet’s distance from
the sun. In other words, one hundred years on this planet is different from
one hundred years on another planet. Lord Brahma lives for one hundred
years according to time on the Brahmaloka planet, but one day of Brahma
is equal to millions of years on this planet. Similarly, the days on the
heavenly planets are equal to six months on this planet. On every planet,
however, the span of life for a human being is roughly one hundred years.
According to the life spans on different planets, the standards of living
also differ.

Text 45] The Characteristics of King Purafijana 1187
TRANSLATION

Many professional singers used to sing about the glories of King Purarijana
and his glorious activities. When it was too hot in the summer, he used to
enter a reservoir of water. He would surround himself with many women
and enjoy their company.

PURPORT

A living being has different activities in different stages of life. One stage
is called jagrat, or the life of awakening, and another is called svapna, or
the life of dream. Another stage is called susupti, or life in an unconscious
state, and still another stage occurs after death. In the previous verse the
life of awakening was described; that is, the man and the woman were
married and enjoyed life for one hundred years. In this verse life in the
dream state is described, for the activities Puraijana accomplished during
the day were also reflected at night in the dream state. Puranjana used to
live with his wife for sense enjoyment, and at night this very sense enjoy-
ment was appreciated in different ways. A man sleeps very soundly when
he is greatly fatigued, and when a rich man is greatly fatigued he goes to
his garden house with many female friends and there enters the water and
enjoys their company. Such is the tendency of the living entity within this
material world. A living entity is never satisfied with a woman unless he is
trained in the system of brahmacarya. Generally a man’s tendency is to
enjoy many women, and even at the very end of life the sex impulse is so
strong that even though one is very old he still wants to enjoy the company
of young girls. Thus because of the strong sex impulse the living entity
becomes more and more involved in this material world.

TRANSLATION
Of the nine gates in that city, seven were on the surface and two were
subterranean. A total of nine doors were constructed, and these led to
different places. All the gates were used by the city’s governor.
PURPORT
The seven gates of the body that are situated upward are the two eyes,
two nostrils, two ears and one mouth. The two subterranean gates are the
rectum and the genitals. The king, or the ruler of the body, who is the
living entity, uses all these doors to enjoy different types of material
pleasures. The system of opening different gates to different places is still
evident in old Indian cities. Formerly a capital was surrounded by walls,
and one passed through various gates to go to various cities or towards
specific directions. In old Delhi there are still remnants of surrounding
walls and various gates known as the Kasmiri Gate, the Lahori Gate, etc.
Similarly, in Ahmedabad there is a Delhi Gate. The point of this simile is
that the living entity wants to enjoy different types of material opulences,
and to this end nature has given him various holes in his body that he can
utilize for sense enjoyment.

PURPORT

Of the seven doors on the surface—namely the two eyes, two ears, two
nostrils and one mouth—five look forward, and these are described as the
doors facing the eastern side. Since looking forward means seeing the sun,
these are described as the eastern gates, for the sun rises in the east. The
gate on the northern side and the gate on the southern side represent the
two ears, and the two gates facing the western side represent the rectum
and genitals. All the doors and gates are described below.

TRANSLATION

The two gates named Khadyota and Avirmukhi were situated facing the
eastern side, but they were constructed in one place. Through those two
gates the King used to go to the city of Vibhrajita accompanied by a friend
whose name was Dyuman.

PURPORT

The two names Khadyota and Avirmukhi mean “glowworm” and “torch-
light.”” This indicates that of the two eyes, the left eye is less powerful in
its ability to see. Although both eyes are constructed in one place, one is
stronger than the other in the power to see. The king, or the living entity,
uses these two gates to see things properly, but he cannot see unless
accompanied by a friend whose name is Dyuman. This friend is the sun.
Although the two eyes are situated in one place, they have no power to see
without the sunlight. Vibhrdjitarm jana-padam. If one wants to see something

very clearly (vibhrdjitam), he must see it with two eyes and the assistance
of his friend the sunlight. Within this body everyone is a king because he
uses his different gates according to his own will. Although he is very much
proud of his power to see or hear, he is nonetheless dependent on the
assistance of nature.

Similarly in the east there were two sets of gates named Nalini and
Nalini, and these were also constructed in one place. Through these gates
the King, accompanied by a friend named Avadhiita, used to go to the city
of Saurabha.
PURPORT
The two gates named Nalini and Nalini are the two nostrils. The living
entity enjoys these two gates with the help of different avadhiitas, or airs,
which constitute the breathing process. Through these gates the living entity
goes to the town of Saurabha, or aroma. In other words, the nostrils, with
the help of their friend the air, enjoy various aromas in the material world.
Nalini and Nalini are the pipes of the nostrils through which one inhales
and exhales, enjoying the aroma of sense pleasure.

The mouth is here described as the chief or the most important gate.
The mouth is a very important entrance because one has two functions
to conduct with the mouth. One function is eating, and the other is
speaking. Our eating is done with the friend Rasajia, by whom the tongue
can taste so many different types of foods. The tongue is also used for
speaking, and it can speak of either material sense enjoyment or Vedic
knowledge. Of course, here material sense enjoyment is stressed. Therefore
the word ‰.358 73 is used.

nied by his friend Srutadhara.
PURPORT
The right ear is used for karma-kandiya, or fruitive activities. As long as
one is attached to the enjoyment of material resources, he hears from the
right ear and uses the five senses to elevate himself to the higher planetary
systems like Pitrloka. Consequently the right ear is here described as the
Pitrha gate.

On the northern side was the gate named Devaha. Through that gate,
King Puranjana used to go with his friend Srutadhara to the place known
as Uttara-pancala.
PURPORT
The two ears are situated on the northern side and the southern side.
The ear on the southern side is very strong and is always anxious to hear
about sense enjoyment. The ear on the northern side, however, is used for
taking initiation from the spiritual master and for gaining promotion to
the spiritual sky. The right ear, or the ear on the southern side, is called
Pitrha, which indicates that it is used for attaining the higher planetary
systems known as Pitrloka, but the left ear, which is known as Devahi, is


--- Page 61 ---
Text 52] The Characteristics of King Puraiijana 1193
utilized for hearing about even higher planetary systems such as Maharloka,
Tapoloka and Brahmaloka—or yet even higher planets situated in the
spiritual universe, where one becomes more inclined to be permanently
situated. This is explained in Bhagavad-gita:
yanti deva-vrata devin
pitin yanti pitr-vratah
bhiitani yanti bhiitejya
yanti mad-ydjino [08 mam
“Those who worship the demigods will take birth among the demigods;
those who worship ghosts and spirits will take birth among such beings;
those who worship ancestors go to the ancestors; and those who worship
Me will live with Me.” (Bg. 9.25)

One who is interested in being happy on this planet as well as after death
generally wants to be elevated to the Pitrlokas. Such a person can use the
right ear for hearing Vedic instructions. However, one who is interested in
going to Tapoloka, Brahmaloka, the Vaikuntha planets or Krsnaloka may
take initiation from the spiritual master in order to beelevated to such lokas.

On the western side was a gate named Asuri. Through that gate King
Purarjana used to go to the city of Gramaka, accompanied by his friend
Durmada.


--- Page 62 ---
1194 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 25
PURPORT

The gate on the western side of the city was known as Asuri because it
was especially meant for the asuras. The word asura refers to those who
are interested in sense gratification, specifically in sex life, to which they
are overly attracted. Thus Purafijana, the living entity, enjoys himself to
his greatest satisfaction by means of the genitals. Consequently he used to
go to the place known as Gramaka. Material sense gratification is also
called gramya, and the place where sex life is indulged in to a great extent
is called Gramaka. When going to Gramaka, Puranjana used to be accom-
panied by his friend Durmada. The word visaya refers to the four bodily
necessities of life—eating, sleeping, mating and defending. The word
durmadena may be analyzed in this way: dur means dusta, or sinful, and
mada means madness. Every living entity who is in contact with material
nature is called mada, or mad. Itis said: pisaci paile yena mati-cchanna haya/
maya-grasta jivera haya se-bhava udaya. When a person is haunted, he
becomes practically insane. When one is in an insane condition, he speaks
all kinds of nonsense. Thus to become engaged in sense gratification, one
has to accept a friend who is durmada, or badly affected by the material
disease.

The words asuri nama pascad dvih are significant in another sense. The
sunrise is first visible from the eastern side—the Bay of Bengal—and gradually
it progresses toward the west. It is practically a csi that people in
the West are more addicted to sense gratification. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu
Himself has certified: pascimera loka saba midha andcara (Cc. Adi 10.89).
The more one goes to the western side, the more he will find people dis-
interested in spiritual life. He will find them behaving against the Vedic
standards. Because of this, people living in the West are more addicted to
sense gratification. In this Bhagavatam it is confirmed: dsuri nama pascad
dvah. In other words, the population on the western side is interested in an
asuric civilization, that is, a materialistic way of life. Lord Caitanya conse-
quently wanted this Krsna consciousness movement to be preached on
the western side of the world so that people addicted to sense gratification
might be benefited by His teachings.

Another gate on the western side was known as Nirrti. Puraiijana used
to go through this gate to the place known as Vaisasa, accompanied by his
friend Lubdhaka.
PURPORT
This is a reference to the rectum. The rectum is supposed to be situated
on the western side of the eyes, nose and ears. This gate is especially meant
for death. When an ordinary living entity abandons his present body, he
passes through the rectum. It is therefore painful. When one is called by
nature to evacuate, one also experiences pain. The friend of the living entity
who accompanies him through this gate is named Lubdhaka, which means
greed. Due to our greed, we eat unnecessarily, and such gluttony causes
pain at the time of evacuation. The conclusion is that the living entity feels
well if he evacuates properly. This gate is known as Nirrti, or the painful
gate.

TRANSLATION

Of the many inhabitants of this city, there are two persons named
Nirvak and Pesaskrt. Although King Purarijana was the ruler of citizens who
possessed eyes, he unfortunately used to associate with these blind men.
Accompanied by them, he used to go here and there and perform various
activities.

PURPORT

This is a reference to the arms and legs of the living entity. The two legs
do not speak, and they are blind. If a person simply trusts his legs to take
him walking, he is likely to fall into a hole or to bump into something.
Thus led by the blind legs, one’s life may be placed in jeopardy.

Of the senses that are working, the hands and legs are very important,
but they have no eyes to see. This means that in the hands and legs there
are no holes. In the head there are many holes—two eyes, two nostrils,
two ears and one mouth—but lower down, in the arms and legs, there are
no holes. Consequently the arms and legs have been described as andha,
blind. Although the living entity has many holes in his body, he nonetheless
has to work with his hands and arms. Although the living entity is the
master of many other senses, when he has to go somewhere, do something
or touch something, he has to use his blind legs and hands.

Text 55] The Characteristics of King Purafijana 1197
TRANSLATION

Sometimes he used to go to his private home with one of his chief
servants, the mind, who was named Visiicina. At that time, illusion,
satisfaction and happiness used to be produced from his wife and children.

PURPORT

According to the Vedic conclusion, one’s self is situated within the
heart. As stated in Vedic language, hrdy ayam atma pratisthitah: the self
is situated within the heart. In the material condition, however, the spirit
soul is covered by the material qualities—namely goodness, passion and
darkness—and within the heart these three qualities react. For instance,
when one is in goodness, he feels happiness; when one is in passion, he
feels satisfaction through material enjoyment; and when one is in darkness,
he feelsbewilderment. All these activities are of the mind, and they function
on the platform of thinking, feeling and willing.

When the living entity is encircled by wife, children and home, he acts
on the mental plane. Sometimes he is very happy, sometimes he is very
much satisfied, sometimes he is not satisfied, and sometimes he is
bewildered. Bewilderment is called moha, illusion. [11115101160 by society,
friendship and love, the living entity thinks that his so-called society, friend-
ship and love, nationality, community, society, etc., will give him protec-
tion. He does not know that after death he will be thrown into the hands
of a very strong material nature that will force him to accept a certain type
of body according to his present work. This body may not even be a human
body. Thus the living entity’s feeling of security in this life in the midst of
society, wife and friendship is nothing but illusion. All living entities
encaged in various material bodies are illusioned by the present activities
of material enjoyment. They forget their real business, which is to go back
home, back to Godhead.

Everyone who is not in Krsna consciousness must be considered to be
in illusion. One’s so-called feelings of happiness and satisfaction resulting
from material things are also illusions. Factually neither society, friendship,
love nor anything else can save one from the onslaught of the external
energy, which is symptomized by birth, death, old age and disease. To get
even one living entity out of the illusory condition is very difficult; there-
fore Lord Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita:

daivi hy esa gunamayi
mama mayd duratyayd


--- Page 66 ---
1198 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 25
mdm eva ye prapadyante
mayam etam taranti te
“This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material
nature, is difficult to overcome. But those who have surrendered unto Me
can easily cross beyond it.” (Bg. 7.14)

Therefore, unless one surrenders completely at the lotus feet of Krsna,
he cannot get out of the entanglement of the three modes of material
nature.

TRANSLATION

Being thus entangled in different types of mental concoction and
engaged in fruitive activities, King Puraiijana came completely under the
control of material intelligence and was thus cheated. Indeed, he used to
fulfill all the desires of his wife, the Queen.

PURPORT

When a living entity is in such bewilderment that he is under the control
of his wife, or material intelligence, he has to satisfy the intelligence of his
so-called wife and act exactly according to her dictates. Various sastras
advise that for material convenience one should keep his wife always
satisfied by giving her ornaments and by following her instructions. In this
way there will be no trouble in family life. Therefore for one’s own social
benefit, one is advised to keep his wife satisfied. In this way, when one
becomes the servant of his wife, he must act according to the desires of his


--- Page 67 ---
Texts 57-61] The Characteristics of King Purafijana 1199
wife. Thus one becomes more and more entangled. In Bengal it is said that
if one becomes an obedient servant of his wife, he loses all reputation.
However, the difficulty is that unless one becomes a most obedient servant
of his wife, family life becomes disturbed. In the Western countries this
disturbance gives rise to the divorce law, and in Eastern countries like
India there is separation. Now this disturbance is confirmed by the new
introduction of the divorce law in India. Within the heart, the mind is
acting, thinking, feeling and willing, and falling under the control of one’s
wife is the same as falling under the control of material intelligence. Thus
one begets children by his wife and becomes entangled in so many activities
and mental concoctions.

King Puraiijana used to chew along with her. When the Queen sang, he also

laughed, he also laughed. When the Queen talked loosely, he also talked
loosely, and when the Queen walked, the King walked behind her. When
the Queen would stand still, the King would also stand still, and when the
Queen would lie down in bed, he would also follow and lie down with

something, he would follow her to hear the same thing. When the Queen

something, the King would follow her to smell the same thing. When the
Queen touched something, the King would also touch it, and when the dear
Queen was lamenting, the poor King also had to follow her in lamentation.
In the same way, when the Queen felt enjoyment, he also enjoyed, and
when the Queen was satisfied, the King also felt satisfaction.
PURPORT

The mind is the place where the self is situated, and the mind is
conducted by the intelligence. The living entity, situated within the heart,
follows the intelligence. The intelligence is herein depicted as the Queen,
and the soul, under mental control, follows the material intelligence just
as the King follows his wife. The conclusion is that material intelligence
is the cause of bondage for the living entity. The point is that one has to
take to spiritual intelligence to come out of this entanglement.

In the life of Maharaja Ambariga, we find that the great Maharaja first
engaged his mind on the lotus feet of Krsna. In this way his intelligence
became purified. Maharaja Ambariga also used his other senses in the
service of the Lord. He engaged his eyes in seeing the Deity in the temple
nicely decorated with flowers. He engaged his sense of smell by smelling
the flowers, and he engaged his legs by walking to the temple. His hands
were engaged in cleansing the temple, and his ears were engaged in hearing
about Krsna. His tongue was engaged in two ways: in speaking about Krsna
and in tasting prasdda offered to the Deity. Materialistic persons, who are
under the full control of material intelligence, cannot perform all these
activities. Thus, consciously or unconsciously, they become entangled by
the dictations of material intelligence. This fact is summarized in the follow-
ing verse.

vipralabdhah— captivated; mahisya—by the Queen; evam—thus; sarva—all;
prakrti—existence; vaiicitah—being cheated; na icchan—without desiring;

TRANSLATION

In this way, King Purafijana was captivated by his nice wife and was
thus cheated. Indeed, he became cheated in his whole existence in the
material world. Even against that poor foolish King’s desire, he remained
under the control of his wife, just like a pet animal that dances according
to the order of its master.

PURPORT

The word vipralabdhah is very significant in this verse. Vi means “specifi-
cally,” and pralabdha means “obtained.” Just to satisfy his desires, the
King got the Queen, and thus he became cheated by material existence.
Although he was not willing to do so, he remained as a pet animal under
the control of material intelligence. Just as a pet monkey dances according
to the desires of its master, the King danced according to the desires of the
Queen. In Srimad-Bhagavatam it is said: mahat-sevarm dvaram hur vimukteh
(5.5.2). If one associates with a saintly person, a devotee, his path of
liberation becomes clear. But if one associates with a woman, or with a
person who is too much addicted to a woman, his path of bondage becomes
completely clear.

On the whole, for spiritual advancement, one must give up the company
of women. This is what is meant by the order of sannydsa, the renounced
order. Before taking sannydsa, or completely renouncing the material
world, one has to practice avoiding illicit sex. Sex life, licit or illicit, is
practically the same, but through illicit sex one becomes more and more
captivated. By regulating one’s sex life there is a chance that one may
eventually be able to renounce sex or renounce the association of women.
If this can be done, advancement in spiritual life comes very easily.

How one becomes captivated by the association of one’s dear wife is
explained in this chapter by Narada Muni. Attraction for one’s wife means


--- Page 71 ---
Text 62] The Characteristics of King Purafijana 1203
attraction for the material qualities. One who is attracted by the material
quality of darkness is in the lowest stage of life, whereas one who is
attracted by the material quality of goodness is in a better position.
Sometimes we see that when a person is on the platform of material
goodness, he is attracted more or less by the cultivation of knowl-
edge. This is, of course, a better position, for knowledge gives one the
preference to accept devotional service. Unless one comes to the platform
of knowledge, the brahma-bhiita stage, one cannot advance in devotional
service. As Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita:
brahma-bhiitah prasannatma
na §ocati na kanksati
samah sarvesu bhiitesu
mad-bhaktir labhate param
“One who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme
Brahman. He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally
disposed to every living entity. In that state he attains pure devotional
service unto Me.” (Bg. 18.54)

The platform of knowledge is advantageous because it is a means by
which one may come to the stage of devotional service. However, if one
takes to devotional service directly, knowledge is revealed without separate
endeavor. This is confirmed in Srimad-Bhagavatam: vasudeve bhagavati
bhakti-yogah prayojitah/ janayaty asu vairdgyarn jiianar ca yad ahaitukam
(1.2.7). Devotional service automatically reveals actual knowledge of our
material existence. One who is sufficiently intelligent immediately attains
the stage of renunciation of so-called society, family and love as well as
other things. As long as we are attached to society, family and love of the
material world, there is no question of knowledge. Nor is there a question
of devotional service. By directly taking to devotional service, however,
one becomes filled with knowledge and renunciation. In this way one’s life
becomes successful.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fourth Canto, Twenty-fifth
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “The Descriptions of the
Characteristics of King Purafjana.”

TRANSLATION

The great sage Narada continued: My dear King, once upon a time King
Puraiijana took up his great bow, and, equipped with golden armor and a
quiver of unlimited arrows and accompanied by eleven commanders, he sat
on his chariot driven by five swift horses and went to the forest named
Paiica-prastha. He took with him in that chariot two explosive arrows. The
chariot itself was situated on two wheels and one revolving axle. On the
chariot were three flags, one rein, one chariot driver, one sitting place, two
poles to which the harness was fixed, five weapons and seven coverings.
The chariot moved in five different styles, and five obstacles lay before it.
All the decorations of the chariot were made of gold.

PURPORT

These three verses explain how the material body of the living entity is
under the control of the three qualities of the external energy. The body
itself is the chariot, and the living entity is the owner of the body, as
explained in Bhagavad-gita: dehino ’smin yatha dehe (Bg. 2.13). The
owner of the body is called the dehi, and he is situated within this body,
specifically within the heart. The living entity is driven by one chariot
driver. The chariot itself is made of three gunas, three qualities of material
nature, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita: yantraridhani mayaya (Bg. 18.61).
The word yantra means carriage. The body is given by material nature, and
the driver of that body is Paramatma, the Supersoul. The living entity is
seated within the chariot. This is the actual position.

The living entity is always being influenced by the three qualities—sattva
(goodness), rajah (passion) and tamah (ignorance). This is also confirmed
in Bhagavad-gita:


--- Page 74 ---
Texts 1-3] King Puraiijana Goes to the Forest to Hunt 1207
tribhir gunamayair bhdavair
ebhih sarvam idarh jagat
77101010017, nabhijanati
mam ebhyah param avyayam
“Deluded by the three modes [goodness, passion and ignorance], the whole
world does not know Me, who am above the modes and inexhaustible.”
(Bg. 7.13)

The living entity is thus bewildered by the three qualities of material
nature. These three qualities are described in this verse as three flags. By a
flag, one can come to know who the owner of the chariot is; similarly, by
the influence of the three qualities of material nature, one can easily know
the direction in which the chariot is moving. In other words, one who has
eyes to see can understand how the body is being driven, influenced by
the particular type or quality of material nature. In these three verses the
activity of the living entity is described to prove how the body becomes
influenced by the quality of ignorance, even when a person wants to be
religious. Narada Muni wanted to prove to King Pracinabarhigat that the
King was being influenced by the tamo-guna, the quality of ignorance,
even though the King was supposed to be very religious.

According to karma-kdndiya, the process of fruitive activities, a person
performs various sacrifices directed by the Vedas, and in all those sacrifices
animal killing, or experimenting on the life of animals to test the power of
Vedic mantras, is enjoined. Animal Killing is certainly conducted under
the influence of the mode of ignorance. Even though one may be religiously
inclined, animal sacrifice is nonetheless recommended in the sastras, not
only in the Vedas but even in the modern scriptures of other sects. These
animal sacrifices are recommended in the name of religion, but actually
animal sacrifice is meant for persons in the mode of ignorance. When such
people kill animals, they can at least do so in the name of religion. How-
ever, when the religious system is transcendental, like the Vaigpava religion,
there is no place for animal sacrifice. Such a transcendental religious
system is recommended by Krsna in Bhagavad-gita:

sarva-dharmadn parityajya
mam ০1071 sarapar vraja
4110771 (एद, sarva-papebhyo
moksayisyami ma $ucah
“Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver
you from all sinful reaction. Do not fear.” (Bg. 18.66)


--- Page 75 ---
1208 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 26

Because King Pracinabarhisat was engaged in performing various sacrifices
in which animals were killed, Narada Muni pointed out that such sacrifices
are influenced by the mode of ignorance. From the very beginning of
Srimad-Bhagavatam it is said: dharmah projjhita-kaitavo tra (1.1.2). All
kinds of religious systems that are involved in cheating are completely
kicked out of Srimad-Bhdgavatam. In the bhagavad-dharma, the religion
dealing with one’s relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
animal sacrifice is not recommended. In the performance of sankirtana-
yajiia—Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare
Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare—there is no recommendation for animal
sacrifices.

In these three verses, King Purafijana’s going to the forest to kill animals
is symbolic of the living entity’s being driven by the mode of ignorance and
thus engaging in different activities for sense gratification. The material
body itself indicates that the living entity is already influenced by the
three modes of material nature and that he is driven to enjoy material
resources. When the body is influenced by the mode of ignorance, its
infection becomes very acute. When it is influenced by the mode of passion,
the infection is at the symptomatic stage. However, when the body is
influenced by the mode of goodness, the materialistic infection becomes
purified. The ritualistic ceremonies recommended in religious systems are
certainly on the platform of goodness, but because within this material
world even the mode of goodness is sometimes polluted by the other
qualities (namely passion and ignorance), a man in goodness is sometimes
driven by the influence of ignorance.

It is herein described that King Puraiijana once went to the forest to
kill animals. This means that he, the living entity, came under the influence
of the mode of ignorance. The forest in which King Purafijana engaged in
hunting was named Pafica-prastha. The word pafica means five, and this
indicates the objects of the five senses. The body has five working senses,
namely, the hands, the legs, the tongue, the rectum and the genitals. By
taking full advantage of these working senses, the body enjoys material
life. The chariot is driven by five horses, which represent the five sense
organs—namely, the eyes, ears, nose, skin and tongue. These sense organs
are very easily attracted by the sense objects. Consequently the horses are
described as moving swiftly. On the chariot King Purafjana kept two
explosive weapons, which may be compared to aharikara, or false ego. This
false ego is typified by two attitudes: “I am this body” (ahanta), and
“Everything in my bodily relationships belongs to me” (mamata).


--- Page 76 ---
Text 4] King Puraiijana Goes to the Forest to Hunt 1209

The two wheels of the chariot may be compared to the two moving
facilities—namely sinful life and religious life. The chariot is decorated with
three flags, which represent the three modes of material nature. The five
kinds of obstacles, or uneven roads, represent the five kinds of air passing
within the body. These are prana, apana, udana, samana and vyana. The
body itself is covered by seven coverings, namely, skin, muscle, fat, blood,
marrow, bone and semen. The living entity is covered by three subtle
material elements and five gross material elements. These are actually
obstacles placed before the living entity on the path of liberation from
material bondage.

The word rasmi (rope) in this verse indicates the mind. The word nida is
also significant, for nida indicates the nest where a bird takes rest. In this
case nida is the heart where the living entity is situated. The living entity
sits in one place only. The causes of his bondage are two: namely lamen-
tation and illusion. In material existence the living entity simply hankers
to get something he can never get. Therefore he is in illusion. As a result of
being in this illusory situation, the living entity is always lamenting. Thus
lamentation and illusion are described herein as dvi-k@bara, the two posts
of bondage.

The living entity carries out various desires through five different
processes, which indicate the working of the five workingsenses. The golden
ornaments and dress indicate that the living entity is influenced by the
quality of rajo-guna, passion. One who has a good deal of money or riches
is especially driven by the mode of passion. Being influenced by the mode
of passion, one desires so many things for enjoyment in this material world.
The eleven commanders represent the ten senses and the mind. The mind is
always making plans with the ten commanders to enjoy the material world.
The forest named Pafica-prastha, where the King went to hunt, is the forest
of the five sense objects: form, taste, sound, smell and touch. Thus in these
three verses Narada Muni describes the position of the material body and
the encagement of the living entity within it.

TRANSLATION

It was almost impossible for King Puraiijana to give up the company of
his Queen even for a moment. Nonetheless, on that day, being very much
inspired by the desire to hunt, he took up his bow and arrow with great
pride and went to the forest, not caring for his wife.

PURPORT

One form of hunting is known as woman-hunting. A conditioned soul is
never satisfied with one wife. Those whose senses are very much uncon-
trolled especially try to hunt for many women. King Puraiijana’s abandon-
ing the company of his religiously married wife is representative of the
conditioned soul’s attempt to hunt for many women for sense gratification.
Wherever a king goes, he is supposed to be accompanied by his queen, but
when the king, or conditioned soul, becomes greatly overpowered by the
desire for sense gratification, he does not care for religious principles.
Instead, with great pride, he accepts the bow and arrow of attachment and
hatred. Our consciousness is always working in two ways—the right way and
the wrong way. When one becomes too proud of his position, influenced
by the mode of passion, he gives up the right path and accepts the wrong
one. Ksatriya kings are sometimes advised to go to the forest to hunt
ferocious animals just to learn how to kill, but such forays are never meant
for sense gratification. Killing animals to eat their flesh is forbidden for
human beings.

TRANSLATION

At that time King Puranjana was very much influenced by demoniac
propensities. Because of this, his heart became very hard and merciless,
and with sharp arrows he killed many innocent animals in the forest, tak-
ing no consideration.

PURPORT

When a man becomes too proud of his material position, he tries to enjoy
his senses in an unrestricted way, being influenced by the modes of passion
and ignorance. He is thus described as asuric, or demoniac. When people
are demoniac in spirit, they are not merciful toward the poor animals. Con-
sequently they maintain various animal slaughterhouses. This is technically
called 501৫ or hiriisa, which means the killing of living beings. In Kali-yuga,
due to the increase of the modes of passion and ignorance, almost all men
are asuric or demoniac; therefore they are very much fond of eating flesh,
and for this end they maintain various kinds of animal slaughterhouses.

In this age of Kali the propensity for mercy is almost nil. Consequently
there is always fighting and wars between men and nations. Men do not
understand that because they unrestrictedly kill so many animals, they also
must be slaughtered like animals in big wars. This is very much evident in
the Western countries. In the West, slaughterhouses are maintained without
restriction, and therefore every fifth or tenth year there is a big war in
which countless people are slaughtered even more cruelly than the animals.
Sometimes during war, soldiers keep their enemies in concentration camps
and kill them in very cruel ways. These are reactions brought about by un-
restricted animal killing in the slaughterhouse and by hunters in the forest.
Proud, demoniac persons do not know the laws of nature, nor do they
know the laws of God. Consequently they unrestrictedly kill poor animals,
not caring for them at all. In this Krsna consciousness movement animal
killing is completely prohibited. One is not accepted as a bona fide student
in this movement unless he promises to follow the four regulative principles:


--- Page 79 ---
1212 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 26
no animal killing, no intoxication, no illicit sex, and no gambling. This
Krsna consciousness movement is the only means by which the sinful
activities of men in this Kali-yuga can be counteracted.

TRANSLATION
If a king is too attracted to eating flesh, he may, according to the direc-
tions of the revealed scriptures on sacrificial performances, go to the forest
and kill some animals that are recommended for killing. One is not allowed
to kill animals unnecessarily or without restrictions. The Vedas regulate
animal killing to stop the extravagance of foolish men influenced by the
modes of passion and ignorance.
PURPORT
The question may be raised why a living being should be restricted in
sense gratification. If a king, to learn how to kill, may go to the forest and
kill animals, why should a living entity, who has been given senses, not be
allowed unrestricted sense gratification? At the present moment this
argument is put forward even by so-called svamis and yogis who publicly
say that because we have senses we must satisfy them by sense gratification.
These foolish svamis and yogis, however, do not know the injunctions of
the sastras. Indeed, sometimes these rascals come out to defy the sastras.
They even publicly announce that there should be no more sastras, no
more books. “Just come to me,” they say, “and Ishall touch you, and you
will become immediately spiritually advanced.”

Text 7] King Purafnjana Goes to the Forest to Hunt 1213

Because demoniac people want to be cheated, so many cheaters are
present to cheat them. At the present moment in this age of Kali-yuga, the
entire human society has become an assembly of cheaters and cheated. For
this reason the Vedic scriptures have given us the proper directions for sense
gratification. Everyone is inclined in this age to eat meat and fish, drink
liquor, and indulge in sex life, but according to the Vedic injunctions, sex
is allowed only in marriage, meat-eating is allowed only when the animal is
killed and offered before the goddess Kali, and intoxication is allowed only
in a restricted way. In this verse the word niyamyate indicates that all these
things—namely, animal killing, intoxication and sex—should be regulated.

Regulations are meant for human beings, not for animals. The traffic
regulations on the street, telling people to keep to the right or the left, are
meant for human beings, not for animals. If an animal violates such a law,
he is never punished, but a human being is punished. The Vedas are not
meant for the animals but for the understanding of human society. A person
who indiscriminately violates the rules and regulations given by the Vedas
is liable to be punished. One should therefore not enjoy his senses accord-
ing to his lusty desires but should restrict himself according to the regulative
principles given in the Vedas. If a king is allowed to hunt in a forest, it is
not for his sense gratification. We cannot simply experiment in the art of
killing. If a king, being afraid to meet rogues and thieves, kills poor animals
and eats their flesh comfortably at home, he may lose his position.

Because in this age kings have such demoniac propensities, monarchy is
abolished by the laws of nature in every country. People have become so
degraded in this age that on the one hand they restrict polygamy and on
the other hand they hunt for women in so many ways. Many business
concerns publicly advertise that topless girls are available in this club or in
that shop. Thus women have become instruments of sense enjoyment in
modern society. The Vedas enjoin, however, that if a man has the propen-
sity to enjoy more than one wife—as is sometimes the propensity for men
in the higher social order, such as the brahmanas, ksatriyas and the vaisyas,
and even sometimes the siidras—he is allowed to marry more than one wife.
Marriage means taking complete charge of a woman and living peacefully
without debauchery. At the present moment, however, debauchery is un-
restricted. Nonetheless, society makes a law that one should not marry
more than one wife. This is typical of a demoniac society.

TRANSLATION

Narada Muni continued to speak to King Pracinabarhisat: My dear King,
any person who works according to the directions of the Vedic scriptures
does not become involved in fruitive activities.

PURPORT

Just as a government may issue trade licenses in order for its citizens to
actin a certain way, the Vedas contain injunctions that restrain and regulate
all of our fruitive activities. All living entities have come into this material
world to enjoy themselves. Consequently the Vedas are given to regulate
sense enjoyment. One who enjoys his senses under the Vedic regulative
principles does not become entangled in the actions and reactions of his
activities. As stated in Bhagavad-gita:

yajidrthat karmano ‘nyatra
loko ’yam karma-bandhanah
tad-artham karma kaunteya
mukta-sangah samdcara
“Work done as a sacrifice for Visnu has to be performed, otherwise work
binds one to this material world. Therefore, O son of Kunti, perform your
prescribed duties for His satisfaction, and in that way you will always
remain unattached and free from bondage.” (Bg. 3.9)

A human being is especially meant to attain liberation from the bondage
of birth, death, old age and disease. He is therefore directed by the Vedic
regulative principles to work in such a way that he may fulfill his desires
for sense gratification and at the same time gradually become freed from
material bondage. Action according to such principles is called knowledge.
Indeed, the word veda means knowledge. The words jidnena na sa lipyate


--- Page 82 ---
Text 8] King Puraiijana Goes to the Forest to Hunt 1215
indicate that by following the Vedic principles, one does not become
involved in the actions and reactions of his fruitive activities.

Everyone is therefore advised to act in terms of the Vedic injunctions
and not irresponsibly. When a person within a state acts according to the
laws and licenses of the government, he does not become involved in
criminal activities. Man-made laws, however, are always defective because
they are made by men who are prone to committing mistakes, being
illusioned, cheating and having imperfect senses. The Vedic instructions
are different because they do not have these four defects. Vedic instructions
are not subject to mistakes. The knowledge of the Vedas is knowledge
received directly from God, and there is consequently no question of
illusion, cheating, mistakes or imperfect senses. All Vedic knowledge is
perfect because it is received directly from God by the parampara disciplic
succession. In Srimad-Bhagavatam it is said: tene brahma hrda ya adi-kavaye
(Bhag. 1.1.1). The original creature of this universe, known as the adi-kavi,
or Lord Brahma, was instructed by Krsna through the heart. After receiving
these Vedic instructions from Lord Krsna Himself, Brahma distributed the
knowledge by the parampara system to Narada, and Narada in turn dis-
tributed the knowledge to Vyasa. In this way Vedic knowledge is perfect.
If we act according to Vedic knowledge, there is no question of being
involved in sinful activities.

Otherwise a person who acts whimsically falls down due to false prestige.

Thus he becomes involved in the laws of nature, which are composed of


--- Page 83 ---
1216 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 26
the three qualities [goodness, passion and ignorance]. In this way a living
entity becomes devoid of his real intelligence and becomes perpetually lost
in the cycle of birth and death. Thus he goes up and down from a microbe
in stool to a high position in the Brahmaloka planet.

PURPORT

There are many important words in this verse. The first is anyathd,
“otherwise,” which indicates one who does not care for the Vedic rules
and regulations. The rules and regulations laid down in the Vedas are called
sastra-vidhi. Bhagavad-gita clearly states that one who does not accept the
sastra-vidhi, or rules and regulations mentioned in the Vedic scriptures,
and acts whimsically or puffed up with false pride, never attains perfection
in this life, nor does he attain happiness or liberation from the material
condition.

yah sastra-vidhim utsrjya
vartate kama-karatah
na sa siddhim avapnoti
na sukham na param gatim
“He who discards scriptural injunctions and acts according to his own
whims attains neither perfection, nor happiness, nor the supreme destina-
tion.” (Bg. 16.23)

Thus one who is deliberately transgressing the rules and regulations of
the sdstras is simply involving himself more and more in material existence
in the three modes of material nature. Human society should therefore
follow the Vedic principles of life, which are summarized in Bhagavad-gita.
Otherwise life in material existence will continue. Foolish persons do not
know that the soul is passing through 8,400,000 species of life. By the
gradual process of evolution, when one comes to the human form of life,
he is supposed to follow the rules and regulations laid down in the Vedas.
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu says that the living entity, since time immemorial,
is suffering the threefold miseries of material nature due to his demoniac
attitude, which is his spirit of revolt against the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Krsna also confirms this in Bhagavad-gita:

mamaivamso jiva-loke
Jjiva-bhiitah sanatanah

manah sasthanindriyani
prakrti-sthani karsati


--- Page 84 ---
Text 8] King Purafjana Goes to the Forest to Hunt 1217
“The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental
parts. Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six
senses, which include the mind.” (Bg. 15.7)

Every living entity is part and parcel of God. There is no reason for the
living entity’s being put into the miserable threefold condition of material
existence but that he voluntarily accepts material existence on the false
pretext of becoming an enjoyer. To save him from this horrible condition,
the Lord has given all the Vedic literatures in His incarnation of Vyasadeva.
It is therefore said:

krsna bhuli’ sei [टव anadi-bahirmukha

ataeva mdyd tare deya sarmsara-duhkha
“By forgetting Krsna, the living entity has become materialistic since time
immemorial. Therefore the illusory energy of Krsna is giving him different
types of miseries in material existence.” (Cc. Madhya 20.117)

mdyd-mugdha jivera nahi svatah krsna-jiana

jivere krpaya kaila krsna veda-purana
“When a living entity is enchanted by the external energy,he cannot revive
his original Krsna consciousness independently. Due to such circumstances,
Krsna has kindly given him the Vedic literatures, such as the four Vedas
and eighteen Puranas.” (Cc. Madhya 20.122)

Every human being should therefore take advantage of the Vedic instruc-
tions; otherwise one will be bound by his whimsical activities and will be
without any guide.

The word manaridhah is also very significant in this verse. Under the
pretext of becoming great philosophers and scientists, men throughout the
whole world are working on the mental platform. Such men are generally
nondevotees, due to not caring for the instructions given by the Lord
to the first living creature, Lord Brahma. The Bhagavatam therefore says:

harav abhaktasya kuto mahad-guna
mano-rathendsati dhavato ® (Bhag. 5.18.12)
A person who is a nondevotee has no good qualifications because he acts
on the mental platform. One who acts on the mental platform has to change
his standard of knowledge periodically. We consequently see that one
philosopher may disagree with another philosopher, and one scientist may


--- Page 85 ---
1218 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 26
put forward a theory contradicting the theory of another scientist. All of
this is due to their working on the mental platform without a standard of
knowledge. In the Vedic instructions, however, the standard of knowledge
is accepted, even though it may sometimes appear that the statements are
contradictory. Because the Vedas are the standard of knowledge, even
though they may appear contradictory, they should be accepted. If one
does not accept them, he will be bound by the material conditions.

The material conditions are described in this verse as guna-pravaha, the
flowing of the three modes of material nature. Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura
therefore says in a song, (miche) mdydra vase, yaccha bhese’, khdaccha
habudubu, bhai: “Why are you suffering? Why are you sometimes being
drowned in the waves of material nature and sometimes coming to the
surface?” (Jiva) krsna-dasa, € visvasa, karle ta’ ara duhkha nai: “Please
therefore accept yourself as the servant of Krsna. Then you will be freed
from all miseries.” As soon as one surrenders to Krsna and accepts the
perfect standard of knowledge, which is Bhagavad-gita as it is, he then comes
out of the material modes of nature and does not fall down and lose his
knowledge.

Nasta-prajiiah. The word prajiia means “perfect knowledge,” and nasta-
prajiia means “one who has no perfect knowledge.” One who does not
have perfect knowledge has only mental speculation. By such mental
speculation one falls down and down into a hellish condition of life. By
transgressing the laws laid down in the $@stras, one cannot become pure in
heart. When one’s heart is not purified, one acts according to the three
material modes of nature. These activities are very nicely explained in
verses 1-6 of the Seventeenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gita. Bhagavad-gita
further explains:

traigunya-visayd veda
nistraigunyo bhavarjuna
nirdvandvo nitya-sattva-stho
niryoga-ksema atmavan
“The Vedas mainly deal with the subject of the three modes of material
nature. Rise above these modes, O Arjuna. Be transcendental to all of them.
Be free from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be
established in the Self.” (Bg. 2.45)

The entire world and all material knowledge is within the three modes of
material nature. One has to transcend these modes, and to attain that
platform of transcendence one must follow the instruction of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead and thus become perfect in life. Otherwise one will
be knocked down by the waves of the material nature’s three modes. This


--- Page 86 ---

is further explained in Srimad-Bhagavatam in the words of Prahlada
Maharaja:
matir na krsne paratah svato va
mitho ’bhipadyeta grha-vratanam
adanta-gobhir visatari tamisram
punah punas carvita-carvananam
(Bhag. 7.5.30)
Materialistic persons who are too much engaged in material enjoyment
and who do not know anything beyond their material experiences are
carried by the whims of material nature. They live a life characterized by
chewing the chewed, and they are controlled by their uncontrolled senses.
Thus they go down to the darkest regions of hellish life.

TRANSLATION
When King Puraiijana was hunting in this way, many animals within the
forest lost their lives with great pain, being pierced by the sharp arrowheads.
Upon seeing these devastating, ghastly activities performed by the King, all
the people who were merciful by nature became very unhappy. Such merci-
ful persons could not tolerate seeing all this killing.
PURPORT
When demoniac persons engage in animal killing, the demigods, or
devotees of the Lord, are very much afflicted by this killing. Demoniac
civilizations in this modern age maintain various types of slaughterhouses


--- Page 87 ---
1220 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 26
all over the world. Rascal svamis and yogis encourage foolish persons to go
on eating flesh and killing animals and at the same time continue their
so-called meditation and mystical practices. All these affairs are ghastly,
and a compassionate person, namely a devotee of the Lord, becomes very
unhappy to see such a sight. The hunting process is also carried on in a
different way, as we have already explained. Hunting women, drinking
different types of liquor, becoming intoxicated, killing animals and enjoying
sex all serve as the basis of modern civilization. Vaisnavas are unhappy to
see such a situation in the world, and therefore they are very busy spreading
this Krsna consciousness movement.

The devotees are pained to see the hunting and killing of animals in the
forest, the wholesale slaughter of animals in the slaughterhouses, and the
exploitation of young girls in brothels that function under different names
as clubs and societies. Being very much compassionate upon the killing of
animals in sacrifice, the great sage Narada began his instructions to King
Pracinabarhisat. In these instructions, Narada Muni explained that devotees
like him are very much afflicted by all the killing that goes on in human
society. Not only are saintly persons afflicted by this killing, but even God
Himself is afflicted and therefore comes down in the incarnation of Lord
Buddha. Jayadeva Gosvami therefore sings: sadaya-hrdaya-darsita-
pasu-ghatam. Simply to stop the killing of animals, Lord Buddha com-
passionately appeared. Some rascals put forward the theory that an animal
has no soul or is something like dead stone. In this way they rationalize
that there is no sin in animal killing. Actually animals are not dead stone,
but the killers of animals are stone-hearted. Consequently no reason or
philosophy appeals to them. They continue keeping slaughterhouses and
killing animals in the forest. The conclusion is that one who does not care
for the instructions of saintly persons like Narada and his disciplic succes
sion surely falls into the category of nasta-prajiia and thus goes to hell.

TRANSLATION

In this way King Puraiijana killed many animals, including rabbits,
boars, buffaloes, bisons, black deer, porcupines and other game animals.
After killing and killing, the King became very tired.

PURPORT

A person in the mode of ignorance commits many sinful activities. In
the Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu, Srila Ripa Gosvami explains that a man
becomes sinful out of ignorance only. The resultant effect of sinful life
is suffering. Those who are not in knowledge, who commit violations of
the standard laws, are subject to be punished under criminal laws. Similarly,
thelaws of nature are very stringent. If a child touches fire without knowing
the effect, he must be burned, even though he is only a child. If a child
violates the law of nature, there is no compassion. Only through ignorance
does a person violate the laws of nature, and when he comes to knowledge
he does not commit any more sinful acts.

The King became tired after killing so many animals. When a man comes
in contact with a saintly person, he becomes aware of the stringent laws of
nature and thus becomes a religious person. Irreligious persons are like
animals, but in this Krsna consciousness movement such persons can come
to a sense of understanding things as they are and abandon the four
principles of prohibited activities—namely, illicit sex life, meat-eating,
gambling and intoxication. This is the beginning of religious life. Those who
are so-called religious and indulge in these four principles of prohibited
activities are pseudo-religionists. Religious life and sinful activity cannot
parallel one another. If one is serious in accepting a religious life, or the
path of salvation, he must adhere to the four basic rules and regulations.
However sinful a man may be, if he receives knowledge from the proper
spiritual master and repents his past activities in his sinful life and stops
them, he immediately becomes eligible to return home, back to Godhead.
This is made possible just by following the rules and regulations given by
the sastra and following the bona fide spiritual master.

At present the whole world is on the verge of retiring from a blind
materialistic civilization, which may be likened to hunting animals in the


--- Page 89 ---
1222 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 26
forest. People should take advantage of this Krsna consciousness movement
and leave their troublesome life of killing. It is said that the killers of animals
should neither live nor die. If they live only to kill animals and enjoy women,
life is not very prosperous. And as soon as a killer dies, he enters the cycle
of birth and death in the lower species of life. That also is not desirable.
The conclusion is that killers should retire from the killing business and
take to this Krsna consciousness movement to make life perfect. A confused,
frustrated man cannot get relief by committing suicide because suicide will
simply lead him to take birth in the lower species of life or to remain as a
ghost, unable to attain a gross material body. Therefore the perfect course
is to retire altogether from sinful activities and take up Krsna consciousness.
In this way one can become completely perfect and go back home, back
to Godhead.

TRANSLATION
After this, the King, very much fatigued, hungry and thirsty, returned
to his royal palace. After returning, he took a bath and had dinner. Then
he took rest and thus became freed from all restlessness.
PURPORT
A materialistic person works throughout the whole week very, very
hard. He is always asking, “Where is money? Where is money?” Then, at
the end of the week, he wants to retire from these activities and go to
some secluded place to rest. King Purafijana returned to his home because
he was very much fatigued from hunting animals in the forest. In this way


--- Page 90 ---
Text 11] King Puraiijana Goes to the Forest to Hunt 1223
his conscience came to stop him from committing further sinful activities
and make him return home. In Bhagavad-gita materialistic persons are
described as dugskrtinah, which indicates those who are always engaged in
sinful activities. When a person comes to his senses and understands how he
is engaging in sinful activities, he returns to his conscience, which is herein
figuratively described as the palace. Generally a materialistic person is
infected by the material modes of passion and ignorance. The results of
passion and ignorance are lust and greed. In the life of a materialist,
activity means working in lust and greed. However, when he comes to his
senses, he wants to retire. According to Vedic civilization, such retirement
is positively recommended, and this portion of life is called vanaprastha.
Retirement is absolutely necessary for a materialist who wants to become
free from the activities of a sinful life.

King Purafijana’s coming home, taking bath and having an appropriate
dinner indicate that a materialistic person must retire from sinful activities
and become purified by accepting a spiritual master and hearing from him
about the values of life. If one would do this, he would feel completely
refreshed, just as one feels after taking a bath. After receiving initiation
from a bona fide spiritual master, one must abandon all kinds of sinful
activities, namely, illicit sex, intoxication, gambling and meat-eating.

The word ucitdhara used in this verse is important. Ucita means appropri-
ate. One must eat appropriately and not take after food like hogs take
after stool. For ahuman being there are eatables described in Bhagavad-gita
(Bg. 17.8) as sattvika-dhdra, or food in the mode of goodness. One should
not indulge in eating food in the modes of passion and ignorance. This is
called ucitahara, or appropriate eating. One who is always eating meat or
drinking liquor, which is eating and drinking in passion and ignorance,
must give these things up so that his real consciousness may be awakened.
In this way one may become peaceful and refreshed. If one is restless or
fatigued, one cannot understand the science of God. As stated in Srimad-
Bhagavatam (1.2.20):

evar prasanna-manaso
bhagavad-bhakti-yogatah
bhagavat-tattva-vijianar
mukta-sangasya jayate
Unless one can become free from the influence of passion and ignorance,
he cannot be pacified, and without being pacified, one cannot understand
the science of God. King Purafjana’s returning home is indicative of man’s


--- Page 91 ---
1224 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 26
returning to his original consciousness, known as Krsna consciousness.
Krsna consciousness is absolutely necessary for one who has committed
a lot of sinful activities, especially killing animals or hunting in the forest.

TRANSLATION

After this, King Purafijana decorated his body with suitable ornaments.
He also smeared scented sandalwood pulp over his body and put on flower
garlands. In this way he became completely refreshed. After this, he began
to search out his Queen.

PURPORT

When a man comes into good consciousness and accepts a saintly person
as a spiritual master, he hears many Vedic instructions in the form of
philosophy, stories, narrations about great devotees and transactions
between God and His devotees. In this way a man becomes refreshed in
mind, exactly like a person who smears scented sandalwood pulp all over
his body and decorates himself with ornaments. These decorations may be
compared to knowledge of religion and the self. Through such knowledge
one becomes detached from a materialistic way of life and engages himself
in always hearing Srimad-Bhdgavatam, Bhagavad-gita and other Vedic
literatures. The word sadhv-alankrta used in this verse indicates that
one must be absorbed in knowledge gathered from the instructions


--- Page 92 ---
Text 13] King Puraiijana Goes to the Forest to Hunt 1225
of saintly persons. Just as King Purafijana began to search out his better
half, the Queen, one who is decorated with knowledge and instructions
from saintly persons should try to search out his original consciousness,
Krsna consciousness. One cannot return to Krsna consciousness unless
he is favored by the instructions of a saintly person. Therefore
Srila Narottama dasa Thakura sings: sddhu-sastra-guru-vakya, cittete
kariya aikya. If we want to become saintly persons, or if we want
to return to our original Krsna consciousness, we must associate with
sadhu (a saintly person), sastra (authoritative Vedic literature), and guru
(a bona fide spiritual master). This is the process.

TRANSLATION

After taking his dinner and having his thirst and hunger satisfied, King
Puraiijana felt some joy within his heart. Instead of being elevated to a
higher consciousness, he became captivated by Cupid, and was moved by a
desire to find his wife, who kept him satisfied in his household life.

PURPORT

This verse is very significant for those desiring to elevate themselves to
a higher level of Krsna consciousness. When a person is initiated by a
spiritual master, he changes his habits and does not eat undesirable eatables
or engage in the eating of meat, the drinking of liquor, illicit sex or gambling.
Sattvika-ahara, foodstuffs in the mode of goodness, are described in the


--- Page 93 ---
1226 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 26
Sastras as wheat, rice, vegetables, fruits, milk, sugar, and milk products.
Simple food like rice, dahl, chapatis, vegetables, milk and sugar constitute
a balanced diet, but sometimes it is found that an initiated person, in the
name of prasada, eats very luxurious foodstuffs. Due to his past sinful life
he becomes attracted by Cupid and eats good food voraciously. It is
clearly visible that when a neophyte in Krsna consciousness eats too
much, he falls down. Instead of being elevated to pure Krsna consciousness,
he becomes attracted by Cupid. The so-called brahmacari becomes agitated
by women, and the vanaprastha may again become captivated into having
sex with his wife. Or he may begin to search out another wife. Due to some
sentiment, he may give up his own wife and come into the association of
devotees and a spiritual master, but due to his past sinful life he cannot
stay. Instead of being elevated to Krsna consciousness, he falls down, being
attracted by Cupid, and takes to another wife for sex enjoyment. The fall
of the neophyte devotee from the path of Krsna consciousness down to
material life is described in Srimad-Bhdgavatam by Narada Muni.
tyaktva sva-dharmariv carapambujari harer
bhajann apakvo tha patet tato yadi
yatra kva vabhadram abhud amusya kim

ko vartha apto ’bhajatarh sva-dharmatah

(Bhag. 1.5.17)

This indicates that although a neophyte devotee may fall down from the
path of Krsna consciousness due to his immaturity, his service to Krsna
never goes in vain. However, a person who remains steadfast in his family
duty or so-called social or family obligation but does not take to Krsna
consciousness receives no profit. One who comes to Krsna consciousness
must be very cautious and refrain from prohibited activities, as defined by
Riipa Gosvami in his Upadesamprta:

atyahdrah praydsas ca
prajalpo niyamagrahah

Jjana-sangas ca laulyarmn ca
sadbhir bhaktir vinasyati

A neophyte devotee should neither eat too much nor collect more money
than necessary. Eating too much or collecting too much is called atyahara.
For such atydhara one must endeavor very much. This is called prayasa.
Superficially one may show himself to be very much faithful to the rules


--- Page 94 ---
Text 14] King Puraiijana Goes to the Forest to Hunt 1227
and regulations but at the same time not to be fixed in the regulative
principles. This is called niyamagraha. By mixing with undesirable persons
or jana-saiiga, one becomes tainted with lust and greed and falls down from
the path of devotional service.

TRANSLATION
At that time King Puraiijana was a little anxious, and he inquired from
the household women: My dear beautiful women, are you and your
mistress all very happy like before, or not?
PURPORT
In this verse the word vedisat indicates King Pracinabarhi. When a man
becomes refreshed by association with devotees and awakes to Krsna
consciousness, he consults the activities of his mind—namely, thinking,
feeling and willing—and decides whether he should again return to his
material activities or stay steady in spiritual consciousness. The word
kusalam refers to that which is auspicious. One can make his home perfectly
auspicious when he engages in devotional service to Lord Visnu. When one
is engaged in activities other than visnpu-bhakti, or in other words when
one is engaged in material activities, he is always filled with anxieties. A
sane man should consult his mind, its thinking, feeling and willing processes,
and decide how these processes should be utilized. If one always thinks of
Krsna, feels how to serve Him and wills to execute the order of Krsna, it
should be known that he has taken good instruction from his intelligence,


--- Page 95 ---
1228 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 26
which is called the mother. Although the King was refreshed, he nonetheless
inquired about his wife. Thus he was consulting, thinking and willing how
he could again return to his steady good consciousness. The mind may
suggest that by visaya-bhoga, or sense enjoyment, one can become happy,
but when one becomes advanced in Krsna consciousness, he does not derive
happiness from material activities. This is explained in Bhagavad-gita:
visaya vinivartante
nirdharasya dehinah
rasa-varjarm raso ‘py asya
param drstvd nivartate
“The embodied soul may be restricted from sense enjoyment, though the
taste for sense objects remains. But, ceasing such engagements by experi-
encing a higher taste, he is fixed in consciousness.” (Bg. 2.59)

One cannot be artificially unattached to the sense objects unless he
finds better engagement in devotional service. Parari drstva nivartate. One
can cease from material activities only when one actually engages in
devotional service.

TRANSLATION

King Puraiijana said: I do not understand why my household parapher-
nalia does not attract me as before. I think that if there is neither a mother
nor devoted wife at home, the home is like a chariot without wheels. Where
is the fool who will sit down on such an unworkable chariot?

PURPORT
The great politician Canakya Pandita said:

mata yasya grhe ndsti bharyd ca priya-vadini

arapyari tena gantavyam yathdaranyarm (06116 grham
“If a person has neither a mother nor a pleasing wife at home, he should
leave home and go to the forest, because for him there is no difference
between the forest and home.” The real mata, or mother, is devotional
service to the Lord, and the real patni, or devoted wife, is a wife who
helps her husband execute religious principles in devotional service. These
two things are required for a happy home.

Actually, a woman is supposed to be the energy of the man. Historically,
in the background of every great man there is either a mother or a wife.
One’s household life is very successful if he has both a good wife and
mother. In such a case, everything about household affairs and all the
paraphernalia in the house become very pleasing. Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu
had both a good mother and pleasing wife, and He was very happy at
home. Nonetheless, for the benefit of the whole human race, He took
sannyasa and left both His mother and wife. In other words, it is essential
that one have both a good mother and wife in order to become perfectly
happy at home. Otherwise home life has no meaning. Unless one is
religiously guided by intelligence and renders devotional service unto the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, his home can never become very pleasing
to a saintly person. In other words, if a man has a good mother or a good
wife, there is no need of his taking sannydsa—that is, unless it is absolutely
necessary, as it was for Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu.

Kindly let me know the whereabouts of that beautiful woman who

PURPORT

There is no difference between a good wife and good intelligence. One
who possesses good intelligence can deliberate properly and save himself
from many dangerous conditions. In material existence there is danger at
every step. In Srimad-Bhdgavatam it is said: padam [0৫001 yad vipadari na
tesam (81:৫2. 10.14.58). This material world is not actually a place of
residence for an intelligent person or a devotee because here there is danger
at every step. Vaikuntha is the real home for the devotee, for there is no
anxiety and no danger. Good intelligence means becoming Krsna
conscious. In the Caitanya-caritamrta it is said: krsna ye bhaje se bada
catura. Unless one is Krsna conscious, he cannot be called an intelligent
person.

Herein we see that King Purafijana was searching after his good wife,
who always helped him out of the dangerous situations that always occur
in material existence. As already explained, a real wife is dharma-patni.
That is, a woman accepted in marriage by ritualistic ceremony is called
dharma-patni, which signifies that she is accepted in terms of religious
principles. Children born of dharma-patni, or a woman married according
to religious principles, inherit the property of the father, but children born
of a woman who is not properly married do not inherit the father’s
property. The word dharma-patni also refers to a chaste wife. A chaste wife
is one who never had any connection with men before her marriage. Once
a woman is given the freedom to mingle with all kinds of men in her youth,
itis very difficult for her to keep chaste. She generally cannot remain chaste.

When butter is brought into the proximity of fire, it melts. The woman is
like fire, and man is like the butter. But if one gets a chaste wife, accepted
through a religious marriage ritual, she can be of great help when one is
threatened by the many dangerous situations of life. Actually such a wife
can become the source of all good intelligence. With such a good wife, the
family’s engagement in the devotional service of the Lord actually makes a
home a grhastha-asrama, or household dedicated to spiritual cultivation.

All the women addressed the King: O master of the citizens, we do not
know why your dear wife has taken on this sort of existence. O killer of

cannot understand why she is acting this way.
PURPORT
When a person is devoid of devotional service, or visnu-bhakti, he takes
to many sinful activities. King Puraifijana left home, neglected his own
wife, and engaged himself in killing animals. This is the position of all
materialistic men. They do not care for a married chaste wife. They take
the wife only as an instrument for sense enjoyment, not as a means for
devotional service. To have unrestricted sex life, the karmis work very hard.


--- Page 99 ---
1232 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 26
They have concluded that the best course is to have sex with any woman
and simply pay the price for her, as though she were a mercantile commodity.
Thus they engage their energy in working very hard for such material
acquisitions. Such materialistic people have lost their good intelligence.
They must search out their intelligence within the heart. A person who
does not have a chaste wife accepted by religious principles always has a
bewildered intelligence.

The wife of King Purafijana was lying on the ground because she was
neglected by her husband. Actually the woman must always be protected
by her husband. We always speak of the goddess of fortune as being placed
on the chest of Narayana. In other words, the wife must remain embraced
by her husband. Thus she becomes beloved and well protected. Just as
one saves his money and places it under his own personal protection, one
should similarly protect his wife by his own personal supervision. Just as
intelligence is always within the heart, so a beloved chaste wife should
always have her place on the chest of a good husband. This is the proper
relationship between husband and wife. A wife is therefore called
ardhangani, or half of the body. One cannot remain with only one leg,
one hand or only one side of the body. He must have two sides. Similarly,
according to nature’s way, husband and wife should live together. In the
lower species of life, among birds and animals, it is seen that by nature’s
arrangement the husband and wife live together. It is similarly ideal in
human life for the husband and wife to live together. The home should be
a place for devotional service, and the wife should be chaste and accepted
by a ritualistic ceremony. In this way one can become happy at home.

TRANSLATION

The great sage Narada continued: My dear King Pracinabarhi, as soon
as King Puraiijana saw his Queen lying on the ground, appearing like a
mendicant, he immediately became bewildered.

PURPORT

In this verse the word avadhutam is especially significant, for it refers
to a mendicant who does not take care of his body. Since the Queen was
lying on the ground without bedding and proper dress, King Purafijana
became very much aggrieved. In other words, he repented that he had
neglected his intelligence and had engaged himself in the forest in killing
animals. In other words, when one’s good intelligence is separated or
neglected, he fully engages in sinful activities. Due to neglecting one’s
good intelligence, or Krsna consciousness, one becomes bewildered and
engages in sinful activities. Upon realizing this, a man becomes repentant.
Such repentance is described by Narottama dasa Thakura: hari hari viphale
janama gondinu/ manusya-janama paiya, radhd-krsna na bhajiyd, janiya
suniyd visa khdinu. Narottama dasa Thakura herein says that he repents
for having spoiled his human life and knowingly drunk poison. By not
being Krsna conscious, one willingly drinks the poison of material life.
The purport is that one certainly becomes addicted to sinful activities
when he becomes devoid of his good chaste wife, or when he has lost his
good sense and does not take to Krsna consciousness.

TRANSLATION
The King, with aggrieved mind, began to speak to his wife with very
pleasing words. Although he was filled with regret and tried to pacify her,
he could not see any symptom of anger caused by love within the heart of
his beloved wife.
PURPORT
The King very much regretted having left his Queen and having gone to
the forest to execute sinful activities. When a person regrets his sinful
activities, the abandoning of Krsna consciousness and good intelligence,
his path of deliverance from the path of material clutches is opened. As
stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam: parabhavas tdvad abodha-jato yavan na
jijidsata atma-tattvam (Bhag. 5.5.5). When a person loses his Krsna con-
sciousness and loses interest in self-realization, he must engage in sinful
activities. All one’s activities in a life devoid of Krsna consciousness simply
lead to defeat and misuse of one’s life. Naturally one who comes to Krsna
consciousness regrets his previous sinful activities in the human form. Only
by this process can one be delivered from the clutches of nescience or
ignorance in materialistic life.

--- Page 102 ---
Text 21] King Puraiijana Goes to the Forest to Hunt 1235
PURPORT
One has to awaken his Krsna consciousness by first regretting his past
deeds. Just as King Puraiijana began to flatter his Queen, one should, by
deliberate consideration, raise himself to the platform of Krsna conscious-
ness. To attain such an end, one must touch the lotus feet of the spiritual
master. Krsna consciousness cannot be achieved by self-endeavor. One must
therefore approach a self-realized Krsna conscious person and touch his
lotus feet. Prahlada Maharaja therefore said:
naisarn matis tavad urukramanghrim
sprsaty anarthapagamo yad-arthah
mahiyasam pada-rajo ‘bhisekam
niskificanandri na vrnita yavat
(Bhag. 7.5.32)
One cannot come to the precincts of Krsna consciousness unless he
touches the dust of the lotus feet of a person who has become a mahdatma,
a great devotee. This is the beginning of the surrendering process. Lord
Krsna wants everyone to surrender unto Him, and this surrendering process
begins when one touches the lotus feet of a bona fide spiritual master. By
sincerely rendering service to a bona fide spiritual master, one begins his
spiritual life in Krsna consciousness. Touching the lotus feet of a spiritual
master means giving up one’s false prestige and unnecessarily puffed up
position in the material world. Those who remain in the darkness of
material existence due to their falsely prestigious positions—so-called
scientists and philosophers—are actually atheists. They do not know the
ultimate cause of everything. Although bewildered, they are not ready to
surrender themselves to the lotus feet of a person who knows things in
their proper perspective. In other words, one cannot arouse Krsna conscious-
ness simply by his own mental speculation. One must surrender to a bona
fide spiritual master. Only this process will help him.

TRANSLATION

King Purafijana said: My dear beautiful wife, when a master accepts a
servant as his own man but does not punish him for his offenses, the
servant must be considered unfortunate.

PURPORT

According to Vedic civilization, domestic animals and servants are
treated exactly like one’s own children. Animals and children are some-
times punished not out of vengeance but out of love. Similarly, a master
sometimes punishes his servant, not out of vengeance but out of love, to
correct him and bring him to the right point. Thus King Purafijana took
his punishment dealt by his wife, the Queen, as mercy upon him. He
considered himself the most obedient servant of the Queen. She was angry
at him for his sinful activities—namely, hunting in the forest and leaving
her at home. King Purafijana accepted the punishment as actual love and
affection from his wife. In the same way, when a person is punished by
the laws of nature, by the will of God, he should not be disturbed. A real
devotee thinks in this way. When a devotee is put into an awkward
position, he takes it as the mercy of the Supreme Lord.

tat te ‘nukampanm su-samiksamano
bhuifijana evatma-krtam vipakam
hrd-vag-vapurbhir vidadhan namas te

This verse states that the devotee accepts a reversal of his position in
life as a benediction by the Lord and consequently offers the Lord more
obeisances and prayers, thinking that the punishment is due to his past
misdeeds and that the Lord is punishing him very mildly. The punishment


--- Page 104 ---
Text 22] King Puraiijana Goes to the Forest to Hunt 1237
awarded by the state or by God for one’s own faults is actually for one’s
benefit. In the Manu-sarhita it is said that the king should be considered
merciful when he condemns a murderer to death because a murderer
punished in this life becomes freed from his sinful activity and in the next
life takes birth cleared of all sins. If one accepts punishment as a reward
dealt by the master, he becomes intelligent enough not to commit the
same mistake again.

TRANSLATION

My dear slender maiden, when a master chastises his servant, the servant
should accept this as great mercy. One who becomes angry must be very
foolish not to know that such is the duty of his friend.

PURPORT

It is said that when a foolish man is instructed in something very nice,
he generally cannot accept it. Indeed, he actually becomes angry. Such
anger is compared to the poison of a serpent, for when a serpent is fed
milk and bananas, its poison actually increases. Instead of becoming
merciful or sober, the serpent increases its poisonous venom when fed
nice foodstuffs. Similarly, when a fool is instructed, he does not rectify
himself, but actually becomes angry.

is as beautiful as the color blue, and see your raised nose and hear your
sweet talk, you will become more beautiful to me and thus attract me and
oblige me. You are my most respected mistress.

PURPORT

An effeminate husband, simply being attracted by the external beauty
of his wife, tries to become her most obedientservant. Sripada Sankaracarya
has therefore advised that we not become attracted by a lump of flesh and
blood. The story is told that at one time a man, very much attracted to a
beautiful woman, wooed the woman in such a way that she devised a plan
to show him the ingredients of her beauty. The woman made a date to see
him, and before seeing him she took a purgative, and that whole day and


--- Page 106 ---
Text 24] King Puranjana Goes to the Forest to Hunt 1239
night she simply passed stool, and she preserved that stool in a pot. The
next night, when the man came to see her, she appeared very ugly and
emaciated. When the man inquired from her about the woman with whom
he had an engagement, she replied, “I am that very woman.” The man
refused to believe her, not knowing that she had lost all her beauty due to
the violent purgative that caused her to pass stool day and night. When the
man began to argue with her, the woman said that she was not looking
beautiful because she was separated from the ingredients of her beauty.
When the man asked how she could be so separated, the woman said,
“Come on, and I will show you.” She then showed him the pot filled with
liquid stool and vomit. Thus the man became aware that a beautiful woman
is simply a lump of matter composed of blood, stool, urine and similar
other disgusting ingredients. This is the actual fact, but in a state of illusion,
man becomes attracted by illusory beauty and becomes a victim of maya.

King Purafijana begged his Queen to return to her original beauty. He
tried to revive her just as a living entity tries to revive his original conscious-
ness, Krsna consciousness, which is very beautiful. All the beautiful features
of the Queen could be compared to the beautiful features of Krsna con-
sciousness. When one returns to his original Krsna consciousness, he actually
becomes steady, and his life becomes successful.

TRANSLATION

O hero's wife, kindly tell me if someone has offended you. I am pre-
pared to give such a person punishment as long as he does not belong to
the brahmana caste. But for the servant of Muraripu [Krsna], I excuse no
one within or beyond these three worlds. No one can freely move after
offending you, for I am prepared to punish him.

PURPORT

According to Vedic civilization, a brahmanpa, or one who is properly
qualified to understand the Absolute Truth—that is, one belonging to the
most intelligent social order—as well as the devotee of Lord Krsna, who is
known as Muradvisa, enemy of a demon named Mura, is not subject to the
rules and regulations of the state. In other words, upon breaking the laws
of the state, everyone can be punished by the government except the
brahmanpas and ४ ३1514९३8. Brahmanpas and Vaignavas never transgress the
laws of the state or the laws of nature because they know perfectly well
the resultant reactions caused by such law-breaking. Even though they may
sometimes appear to violate the laws, they are not to be punished by the
king. This instruction was given to King Pracinabarhisat by Narada Muni.
King Purafijana was a representative of King Pracinabarhisat, and Narada
Muni was reminding King Pracinabarhisat of his forefather, Maharaja
Prthu, who never chastised a 07৫12710180 or a Vaignava.

One’s pure intelligence, or pure Krsna consciousness, becomes polluted
by material activities. Pure consciousness can again be revived by the
process of sacrifice, charity, pious activities, etc., but when one pollutes
his Krsna consciousness by offending a 0721777072৫ or a Vaignava, it is very
difficult to revive. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has described the vaispavae-
aparddha, or offense to a Vaisnpava, as “the mad elephant offense.” One
should be very careful not to offend a Vaisnava or a brahmana. Even the
great yogi Durvasa was harassed by the Sudarsana cakra when he offended
the Vaisnava Maharaja Ambarisa, who was neither a brahmana nor a sannyast
but an ordinary householder. Maharaja Ambarisa was a Vaisnava, and con-
sequently Durvasa Muni was chastised.

The conclusion is that if Krsna consciousness is covered by material
sins, one can eliminate the sins simply by chanting the Hare Krsna mantra,
but if one pollutes his Krsna consciousness by offending a brahmana or a
Vaisnava, one cannot revive it until one properly atones for the sin by


--- Page 108 ---
Text 25] King Puranjana Goes to the Forest to Hunt 1241
pleasing the offended Vaisnava or brahmana. This was the course that
Durvasa Muni had to follow, for he surrendered unto Maharaja Ambariga.
A vaisnava-aparidha cannot be atoned for by any means other than by
begging the pardon of the offended Vaignava.

My dear wife, until this day I have never seen your face without tilaka
decorations, nor have I seen you so morose and without luster or affection.
Nor have I seen your two nice breasts wet with tears from your eyes. Nor
have I ever before seen your lips, which are ordinarily as red as the bimba
fruit, without their reddish hue.
PURPORT
Every woman looks very beautiful when decorated with tilaka and
vermillion. A woman generally becomes very attractive when her lips are
colored with reddish saffron or vermillion. But when one’s consciousness
and intelligence are without any brilliant thoughts about Krsna, they
become morose and lusterless, so much so that one cannot derive any
benefit despite sharp intelligence.

My dear Queen, due to my sinful desires I went to the forest to hunt
without asking you. Therefore I must admit that I have offended you.
Nonetheless, thinking of me as your most intimate subordinate, you should
still be very much pleased with me. Factually I am very much bereaved,
but being pierced by the arrow of Cupid, I am feeling lusty. But where is
the beautiful woman who would give up her lusty husband and refuse to
unite with him?
PURPORT
Both man and woman desire one another; that is the basic principle of
material existence. Women in general always keep themselves beautiful
so that they can be attractive to their lusty husbands. When a lusty husband
comes before his wife, the wife takes advantage of his aggressive activities
and enjoys life. Generally when a woman is attacked by a man—whether
her husband or some other man—she enjoys the attack, being too lusty.
In other words, when one’s intelligence is properly utilized, both the
intellect and the intelligent person enjoy one another with great satis-
faction. As stated in Srimad-Bhdgavatam: yan maithunadi grhamedhi-


--- Page 110 ---
Text 26] King Puranjana Goes to the Forest to Hunt 1243
sukhariv hi tuccham kanduyanena karayor iva duhkha-duhkham (Bhag.
7.9.45). The actual happiness of the karmis is sex life. They work very
hard outside the home, and to satiate their hard labor, they come home to
enjoy sex life. King Purafijana went to the forest to hunt, and after his
hard labor he returned home to enjoy sex life. If a man lives outside the
home and spends a week in a city or somewhere else, at the end of the
week he becomes very anxious to return home and enjoy sex with his
wife. This is confirmed in Srimad-Bhagavatam: yan maithunddi grhamedhi-
sukhariv hi tuccham. Karmis work very hard simply to enjoy sex. Modern
human society has improved the materialistic way of life simply by
inducing unrestricted sex life in many different ways. This is most
prominently visible in the Western world.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fourth Canto, Twenty-sixth
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “King Puraiijana Goes to the
Forest to Hunt, and His Queen Becomes Angry.”

After hunting in the forest, King Puranjana returned home, and after
refreshing himself by taking a bath and eating nice food, he searched for
his wife. When he saw her lying down on the ground without a bed, as if
neglected, and devoid of any proper dress, he became very much aggrieved.
1245


--- Page 112 ---
1246 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 27
He then became attracted to her and began to enjoy her company. A living
entity is similarly engaged in the material world in sinful activities. These
sinful activities may be compared to King Purarijana’s hunting in the forest.

A sinful life can be counteracted by various processes of religion such as
yajiia, vrata and dana—that is, the performance of sacrifices, the taking of
a vow for some religious ritual, and the giving of charity. In this way one
may become free from the reactions of sinful life and at the same time
awaken his original Krsna consciousness. By coming home, taking his bath,
eating nice foodstuffs, getting refreshed and searching out his wife, King
Purarijana came to his good consciousness in his family life. In other words,
a systematic family life as enjoined in the 16005 is better than an irre-
sponsible sinful life. If a husband and wife combine together in Krsna
consciousness and live together peacefully, that is very nice. However, if a
husband becomes too much attracted by his wife and forgets his duty in
life, the implications of materialistic life will again resume. Srila Ripa
Gosvami has therefore recommended anasaktasya visayan (Bh.r.s. 1.2.255).
Without being attached by sex, the husband and wife may live together for
the advancement of spiritual life. The husband should engage in devotional
service, and the wife should be faithful and religious according to the
Vedic injunctions. Such a combination is very good. However, if the
husband becomes too much attracted to the wife due to sex, the position
becomes very dangerous. Women in general are very much sexually inclined.
Indeed, itis said that a woman’s sex desire is nine times stronger than a man’s.
It is therefore a man’s duty to keep a woman under his control by satisfying
her, giving her ornaments, nice food and clothes, and engaging her in re-
ligious activities. Of course a woman should have a few children and in this
way not be disturbing to the man. Unfortunately, if the man becomes
attracted to the woman simply for sex enjoyment, then family life becomes
abominable.

The great politician Canakya Pandita has said: bharya ripavati satruh—a
beautiful wife is an enemy. Of course every woman in the eyes of her
husband is very beautiful. Others may see her as not very beautiful, but the
husband, being very much attracted to her, sees her always as very beautiful.
If the husband sees the wife as very beautiful, it is to be assumed that he is
too much attracted to her. This attraction is the attraction of sex. The
whole world is captivated by the two modes of material nature rajo-guna
and tamo-guna, passion and ignorance. Generally women are very much
passionate and are less intelligent; therefore somehow or other a man should
not be under the control of their passion and ignorance. However, by
performing bhakti-yoga, or devotional service, a man can be raised to the


--- Page 113 ---
Text 2] Attack by Candavega on the City of Puraiijana 1247
platform of goodness. If a husband situated in the mode of goodness can
control his wife, who is in passion and ignorance, the woman is benefited.
Forgetting her natural inclination for passion and ignorance, the woman
becomes obedient and faithful to her husband, who is situated in goodness.
Such a life becomes very welcome. The intelligence of the man and
woman may then work very nicely together, and they can make a progres-
sive march towards spiritual realization. Otherwise, the husband, coming
under the control of the wife, sacrifices his quality of goodness and
becomes subservient to the qualities of passion and ignorance. In this way
the whole situation becomes polluted.

The conclusion is that a household life is better than a sinful life devoid
of responsibility, but if in the household life the husband becomes subor-
dinate to the wife, involvement in materialistic life again becomes promi-
nent. In this way a man’s material bondage becomes enhanced. Because of
this, according to the Vedic system, after a certain age a man is recom-
mended to abandon his family life for the stages of vanaprastha and
sannyasa.

1248 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 27
PURPORT

A woman is generally accustomed to dress herself nicely with fine
garments and decorative ornaments. She may even sometimes wear flowers
in her hair. Women especially dress themselves up in the evening because
the husband comes home in the evening after working hard all day. It is
the duty of the wife to dress herself up very nicely so that when her
husband returns home he becomes attracted by her dress and cleanliness
and thus becomes satisfied. In other words, the wife is the inspiration of
all good intelligence. Upon seeing one’s wife dressed nicely, one can think
very soberly about family business. When a person is too anxious about
family affairs, he cannot discharge his family duties nicely. A wife is
therefore supposed to be an inspiration and should keep the husband’s
intelligence in good order so that they can combinedly prosecute the
affairs of family life without impediment.

joking words. Thus King Puranjana became very much captivated by his
beautiful wife and deviated from his good sense. He forgot that the passing
of days and nights meant that his span of life was being reduced without
profit.
PURPORT

The word pramada in this verse is very significant. A beautiful wife is
certainly enlivening to her husband but at the same time is the cause of
degradation. The word pramada means enlivening as well as maddening.
Generally a householder does not take the passing of days and nights very
seriously. A person in ignorance takes it as the usual course that days
come, and, after the days, the nights come. This is the law of material
nature. But a man in ignorance does not know that when the sun rises
early in the morning it begins to take away the balance of his life. Thus
day after day the span of one’s life is reduced, and, forgetting the duty
of human life, the foolish man simply remains in the company of his wife
and enjoys her in a secluded place. Such a condition is called apakrsta-
cetana, or degraded consciousness. Human consciousness should be used
for elevation to Krsna consciousness. But when a person is too much
attracted to his wife and family affairs, he does not take Krsna conscious-
ness very seriously. He thus becomes degraded, not knowing that he cannot
buy back even a second of his life in return for millions of dollars. The
greatest loss in life is passing time without understanding Krsna. Every
moment of our lives should be utilized properly, and the proper use of
life is to increase devotional service to the Lord. Without devotional
service to the Lord, the activities of life become simply a waste of time.
Srama eva hi kevalam. Simply by becoming “dutiful” we do not make
any profit in life. As confirmed in Srimad-Bhdgavatam:

dharmah svanusthitah purisam
visvaksena-kathasu yah
notpadayed yadi ratim
srama eva hi kevalam

“Duties [dharma]executed by men, regardless of occupation, are only
so much useless labor if they do not provoke attraction for the message
of the Supreme Lord.” (Bhag. 1.2.8)

If after performing one’s occupational duty very perfectly, one does
not make progress in Krsna consciousness, it should be understood that he
has simply wasted his time in valueless labor.

TRANSLATION
In this way, increasingly overwhelmed by illusion, King Puranjana,
although advanced in consciousness, remained always lying down with his
head on the pillow of his wife’s arms. In this way he considered woman to
be his ultimate life and soul. Becoming thus overwhelmed by the mode of
ignorance, he could not understand the meaning of self-realization, of his
self, or of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
PURPORT
Human life is meant for self-realization. First of all one has to realize his
own self, which is described in this verse as nijam. Then he has to understand
or realize the Supersoul or Paramatma, the Supreme Personality of God-
head. However, when one becomes too much materially attached, he takes
a woman to be everything. This is the basic principle of material attach-
ment. In such a condition, one cannot realize his own self or the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. In Srimad-Bhagavatam it is therefore said: mahat-
sevam dvaram ahur vimuktes tamo-dvaram yositam sangi-sarigam (Bhag.
5.5.2). If one associates with mahatmas, or devotees, his path of liberation


--- Page 117 ---
Text 5] Attack by Candavega on the City of Puraiijana 1251
is opened. But if one becomes too much attached to women or to persons
who are also attached to women—that is, attached to women directly or
indirectly—he opens the tamo-dvdram, the door to the darkest region of
hellish life.

King Purarijana was a great soul, highly intellectual and possessed of
advanced consciousness, but due to his being too much addicted to women,
his whole consciousness was covered. In the modern age the consciousness
of people is too much covered by wine, women and flesh. Consequently
people are completely unable to make any progress in self-realization. The
first step of self-realization is to know oneself as spirit soul apart from the
body. In the second stage of self-realization one comes to know that every
soul, every individual living entity, is part and parcel of the Supreme Soul,
Paramatma, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita:

mamaivamso jiva-loke
jiva-bhiitah sanatanah
manah sasthanindriyani
prakrti-sthani karsati
“The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental
parts. Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six
senses, which include the mind.” (Bg. 15.7)

All living entities are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. Unfortunately
in this present civilization both men and women are allowed to be attracted
to one another from the very beginning of life, and because of this they are
completely unable to come to the platform of self-realization. They do not
know that without self-realization they suffer the greatestlossin the human
form of life. Thinking of a woman always within one’s heart is tantamount
to lying down with a woman on a valuable bedstead. The heart is the bed-
stead, and it is the most valuable bedstead. When a man thinks of women
and money, he lies down and rests on the arms of his beloved woman or
wife. In this way he overindulges in sex life and thus becomes unfit for
self-realization.

TRANSLATION

My dear King Pracinabarhisat, in this way King Puraiijana, with his
heart full of lust and sinful reactions, began to enjoy sex with his wife, and
in this way his new life and youth expired in half a moment.

PURPORT
Srila Govinda dasa Thakura has sung:
e-dhana, yauvana, putra, parijana,
ithe ki ache paratiti re
kamala-dala-jala, jivana talamala,
bhaja hun hari-pada niti re

In this verse Srila Govinda dasa actually says that there is no bliss in the
enjoyment of youthful life. In youth a person becomes very lusty to enjoy
all kinds of sense objects. The sense objects are form, taste, smell, touch
and sound. The modern scientific method, or advancement of scientific
civilization, encourages the enjoyment of these five senses. The younger
generation is very pleased to see a beautiful form, to hear radio messages of
material news and sense gratificatory songs, to smell nice scents, nice flowers,
and to touch the soft body or breasts of a young woman and gradually
touch the sex organs. All of this is also very pleasing to the animals; there-
fore in human society there are restrictions in the enjoyment of the five
sense objects. If one does not follow, he becomes exactly like an animal.

Thus in this verse it is specifically stated, kama-kasmala-cetasah: the
consciousness of King Puranjana was polluted by lusty desires and sinful
activities. In the previous verse it is stated that Puraiijana, although ad-
vanced in consciousness, lay down on a very soft bed with his wife. This
indicates that he indulged too much in sex. The words navam vayah are
also significant in this verse. They indicate the period of youth from age
sixteen to thirty. These thirteen or fifteen years of life are years in which
one can very strongly enjoy the senses. When one comes to this age he


--- Page 119 ---
Text 5] Attack by Candavega on the City of Puraiijana 1253
thinks that life will go on and that he will simply continue enjoying his
senses, but “time and tide wait for no man.” The span of youth expires
very quickly. One who wastes his life simply by committing sinful activities
in youth immediately becomes disappointed and disillusioned when the
brief period of youth is over. The material enjoyments of youth are
especially pleasing to a person who has no spiritual training. If one is
trained only according to the bodily conception of life, he simply leads a
disappointed life because bodily sense enjoyment finishes within forty
years or so. After forty years, one simply leads a disillusioned life because
he has no spiritual knowledge. For such a person, the expiration of youth
occurs in half a moment. Thus King Purarijana’s pleasure, which he took in
lying down with his wife, expired very quickly.

Kama-kasmala-cetasah also indicates that unrestricted sense enjoyment is
not allowed in the human form of life by the laws of nature. If one enjoys
his senses unrestrictedly, he leads a sinful life. The animals do not violate
the laws of nature. For example, the sex impulse in animals is very strong
during certain months of the year. The lion is very powerful. He is a flesh-
eater and is very strong, but he enjoys sex only once in a year. Similarly,
according to religious injunctions a man is restricted to enjoy sex only
once in a month, after the menstrual period of the wife, and if the wife is
pregnant, he is not allowed sex life at all. That is the law for human beings.
A man is allowed to keep more than one wife because he cannot enjoy sex
when the wife is pregnant. If he wants to enjoy sex at such a time, he may
go to another wife who is not pregnant. These are laws mentioned in the
Manu-samhita and other scriptures.

These laws and scriptures are meant for human beings. As such, if one
violates these laws, he becomes sinful. The conclusion is that unrestricted
sense enjoyment means sinful activities. Illicit sex is sex that violates the
laws given in the scriptures. When one violates the laws of the scriptures,
or the Vedas, he commits sinful activities. One who is engaged in sinful
activities cannot change his consciousness. Our real function is to change
our consciousness from kasmala, sinful consciousness, to Krsna, the supreme
pure, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita: param brahma parari dhama pavitram
paraman bhavdn: “You are the Supreme Brahman, the ultimate, the su-
preme abode and purifier.” (Bg. 10.12)

Krsna is the supreme pure, and if we change our consciousness from
material enjoyment to Krsna, we become purified. This is the process
recommended by Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu as the process of ceto-
darpana-marjanam, cleansing the mirror of the heart.

TRANSLATION

The great sage Narada then addressed King Pracinabarhisat: O one whose
life span is great [virat], in this way King Puranjana begot 1,100 sons
within the womb of his wife Puranjani. However, in this business he passed
away half of his life span.

PURPORT

In this verse there are several significant words, the first of which is
ekadasa satani. Puranjana had begotten 1,100 sons within the womb of his
wife, and thus passed away half of his life. Actually every man follows a
similar process. If one lives for one hundred years at the utmost, in his
family life he simply begets children up to the age of fifty. Unfortunately
at the present moment people do not live even a hundred years; nonethe-
less they beget children up to the age of sixty. Another point is that
formerly people used to beget one hundred to two hundred sons and
daughters. As will be evident from the next verse, King Purarijana not only
begot 1,100 sons but also 110 daughters. At the present moment no one
can produce such huge quantities of children. Instead, mankind is very
busy checking the increase of population by contraceptive methods.

We do not find in Vedic literatures that they ever used contraceptive
methods, although they were begetting hundreds of children. Checking
population by a contraceptive method is another sinful activity, but in this
age of Kali people have become so sinful that they do not care for the
resultant reactions of their sinful lives. King Purarijana lay down with his


--- Page 121 ---
Text 7] Attack by Candavega on the City of Puraiijana 1255
wife Puranjani and begot a large number of children, and there is no
mention in these verses that he used contraceptive methods. According to
the Vedic scriptures the contraceptive method should be restraint in sex
life. It is not that one should indulge in unrestricted sex life and avoid
children by using some method to check pregnancy. If a man is in good
consciousness, he consults with his religious wife, and as a result of this
consultation, with intelligence, one advances in his ability to estimate the
value of life. In other words, if one is fortunate enough to have a good
conscientious wife, he can decide by mutual consultation that human life
is meant for advancing in Krsna consciousness and not for begetting a large
number of children. Children are called parinama, or by-products, and
when one consults his good intelligence he can see that his by-products
should be the expansion of his Krsna consciousness.

other good qualities.

Children begotten under the rules and regulations of the scriptures

generally become as good as the father and mother, but children born


--- Page 122 ---
1256 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 27
illegitimately mainly become varna-sarikara. The varna-sarikara population
is irresponsible to the family, community and even to themselves. Formerly
the varna-sarikara population was checked by the observation of the
reformatory method called garbhadhana-samskara, a child-begetting re-
ligious ceremony. In this verse we find that although King Puranjana had
begotten so many children, they were not varna-sarikara. All of them were
good, well-behaved children, and they had good qualities like their father
and mother.

Even though we may produce many good children, our desire for sex
that is beyond the prescribed method is to be considered sinful. Too much
enjoyment of any of the senses (not only sex) results in sinful activities.
Therefore one has to become a svami or a gosvami at the end of his life.
One may beget children up to the age of fifty, but after fifty,
one must stop begetting children and should accept the vanaprastha order.
In this way he must leave home and then become a sannyasi. A sannyasi’s
title is svami or gosvami, which means that he completely refrains from
sense enjoyment. One should not accept the sannyasa order whimsically;
he must be fully confident that he can restrain his desires for sense gratifi-
cation. King Purarjana’s family life was, of course, very happy. As men-
tioned in these verses, he begot 1,100 sons and 110 daughters. Everyone
desires to have more sons than daughters, and since the number of
daughters was less than the number of sons, it appears that King Puranijana’s
family life was very comfortable and pleasing.

TRANSLATION

After this, King Puraijana, King of the Paiicala country, in order to
increase the descendants of his paternal family, married his sons with
qualified wives and married his daughters with qualified husbands.

PURPORT

According to the Vedic system, everyone should marry.One has to
accept a wife because a wife will produce children, and the children in
their turn will offer foodstuffs and funeral ceremonies so that the fore-
fathers, wherever they may live, will be made happy. The offering of
oblations in the name of Lord Visnu is called pindodaka, and it is necessary
that the descendants of a family offer pinda to the forefathers.

Not only was Puraiijana, the King of Pancala, satisfied in his own sex
life, but he arranged for the sex life of his 1,100 sons and 110 daughters.
In this way one can elevate an aristocratic family to the platform of a
dynasty. It is significant in this verse that Purafjana got both sons and
daughters married. It is the duty of a father and mother to arrange for the
marriage of their sons and daughters. That is the obligation in Vedic
society. Sons and daughters should not be allowed freedom to intermingle
with the opposite sex unless they are married. This Vedic social organi-
zation is very good in that it stops the promulgation of illicit sex life, or
varna-sankara, which appears under different names in this present day.
Unfortunately in this age although the father and mother are anxious to
get their children married, the children refuse to get married by the
arrangement of the parents. Consequently the number of varna-sankara
has increased throughout the world under different names.

TRANSLATION

Of these many sons, each produced hundreds and hundreds of grandsons.
In this way the whole city of Paricala became overcrowded by these sons
and grandsons of King Purarijana.

PURPORT

We must remember that Puranjana is the living entity, and the city
Paricala is the body. The body is the field of activity for the living entity,
as stated in Bhagavad-gita: ksetra-ksetrajiia (Bg. 13.27). There are two
constituents: one is the living entity (ksetra-jiia), and the other is thebody
of the living entity (ksetra). Any living entity can know that he is covered
by the body if he only contemplates the body a little bit. Just with a little
contemplation he can come to understand that the body is his possession.
One can understand this by practical experience and by the authority of
the sastras. In Bhagavad-gita it is said: dehino ’smin yatha dehe (Bg. 2.13).
The proprietor of the body, the soul, is within the body. The body is taken
as the painicala-desa, or the field of activities wherein the living entity can
enjoy the senses in their relationship to the five sense objects—namely,
gandha, rasa, ripa, sparsa and sabda—that is, sense objects made out of
earth, water, fire, air and sky. Within this material world covered by the
material body of subtle and gross matter, every living entity creates actions
and reactions, which are herein known allegorically as sons and grandsons.
There are two kinds of actions and reactions—namely, pious and impious.
In this way our material existence becomes coated by different actions and
reactions. In this regard, Srila Narottama dasa Thakura states:

karma-kanda, jaana-kanda, kevala visera bhanda,
amrta baliya yeba khaya
nana yoni sada phire, kadarya bhaksana kare,
tara janma adhah-pate yaya

“Fruitive activities and mental speculation are simply cups of poison.
Whoever drinks of them, thinking them to be nectar, must struggle very
hard life after life, in different types of bodies. Such a person eats all kinds


--- Page 125 ---
Text 10] Attack by Candavega on the City of Puraiijana 1259
of nonsense and becomes condemned by his activities of so-called sense
enjoyment.”

Thus the field of action and reactions, by which one’s descendants are
increased, begins with sex life. Puranjana increased his whole family by
begetting sons who in their turn begot grandsons. Thus the living entity,
being inclined toward sexual gratification, becomes involved in many
hundreds and thousands of actions and reactions. In this way he remains
within the material world simply for the purpose of sense gratification and
transmigrates from one body to another. His process of reproducing so
many sons and grandsons results in so-called societies, nations, communities
and so on. All these communities, societies, dynasties and nations simply
expand from sex life. As stated by Prahlada Maharaja: yan maithunadi
grhamedhi-sukham hi tuccham (Bhag. 7.9.45). A grhamedhi is one who
wants to remain within this material existence. This means that he wants
to remain within this body or society and enjoy friendship, love and
community. His only enjoyment is in increasing the number of sex
enjoyers. He enjoys sex and produces children, who in their turn marry
and produce grandchildren. The grandchildren also marry and in their
turn produce great-grandchildren. In this way the entire earth becomes
overpopulated, and then suddenly there are reactions provoked by material
nature in the form of war, famine, pestilence and earthquakes, etc. Thus
the entire population is again extinguished simply to be recreated. This
process is explained in Bhagavad-gita:

bhiita-gramah sa evayam
611४6 bhitva praliyate
ratry-igame ‘vasah partha
prabhavaty ahar-agame
“Again and again the day comes, and this host of beings is active, and again
the night falls, O Partha, and they are helplessly dissolved.” (Bg. 8.19)

Due to a lack of Krsna consciousness, all this creation and annihilation
is going on under the name of human civilization. This cycle continues due
to man’s lack of knowledge of the soul and the Supreme Personality of
Godhead.

TRANSLATION
These sons and grandsons were virtually plunderers of King Puranjana’s
riches, including his home, treasury, servants, secretaries and all other
paraphernalia. Puraijana’s attachment for these things was very deep-
rooted.
PURPORT
In this verse the word riktha-haresu, meaning plunderers of wealth, is
very significant. One’s sons, grandsons and other descendants are ultimately
plunderers of one’s accumulated wealth. There are many celebrated
businessmen and industrialists who produce great wealth and are highly
praised by the public, but all their money is ultimately plundered by
their sons and grandsons. In India we have actually seen one industrialist,
who, like King Puranjana, was very much sexually inclined and had a
half dozen wives. Each of these wives had a separate establishment that
necessitated the expenditure of several thousands of rupees. When I was
engaged in talking with him, I saw that he was very busy trying to secure
money so that all his sons and daughters would get at least 500,000 rupees
each. Thus such industrialists, businessmen or karmis are called miadhas
in the sastras. They work very hard, accumulate money, and are satisfied
to see that this money is plundered by their sons and grandsons. Such
people do not want to return their wealth to its actual owner. As stated
in Bhagavad-gita:
bhoktaram yajiia-tapasam
sarva-loka-mahesvaram
suhrdam sarva-bhiitanam
jiaatva mam santim rcchati
“The sages, knowing Me as the ultimate purpose of all sacrifices and
austerities, the Supreme Lord of all planets and demigods and the bene-
factor and well-wisher of all living entities, attain peace from the pangs of
material miseries.” (Bg. 5.29)


--- Page 127 ---
Text 10] Attack by Candavega on the City of Purarijana 1261
The real proprietor of all wealth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
He is the actual enjoyer. So-called earners of money are those who simply
know tricks by which they can take away God’s money under the guise
of business and industry. After accumulating this money, they enjoy
seeing it plundered by their sons and grandsons. This is the materialistic
way of life. In materialistic life one is encaged within the body and deluded
by false egoism. Thus one thinks, “I am this body. I am a human being.
I am an American. I am an Indian.” This bodily conception is due to false
ego. Being deluded by false ego, one identifies himself with a certain
family, nation or community. In this way one’s attachment for the material
world grows deeper and deeper. Thus it becomes very difficult for the
living entity to extricate himself from his entanglement. Such people are
graphically described in the Sixteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gita in this way:
idam adya maya labdham
imam prapsye manoratham
idam astidam api me
bhavisyati punar dhanam
asau maya hatah $atrur
hanisye caparan api
iSvaro "ham aham bhogi
siddho "ham balavan sukht
dadhyo ’bhijanavan asmi
ko ’nyo ’sti sadrso maya
yaksye dasyami modisya
ity ajiidna-vimohitah
“The demoniac person thinks: ‘So much wealth do I have today, and I
will gain more according to my schemes. So much is mine now, and it
will increase in the future, more and more. He is my enemy, and I have
killed him; and my other enemy will also be killed. I am the lord of every-
thing, I am the enjoyer, I am perfect, powerful and happy. I am the
richest man, surrounded by aristocratic relatives. There is none so powerful
and happy as I am. I shall perform sacrifices, I shall give some charity,
and thus I shall rejoice.” In this way, such persons are deluded by
ignorance.” (Bg. 16.13-15)
In this way people engage in various laborious activities, and their
attachment for body, home, family, nation and community becomes more
and more deep-rooted.

TRANSLATION
The great sage Narada continued: My dear King Pracinabarhisat, like
you King Puranijana also became implicated in so many desires. Thus he
worshiped demigods, forefathers and social leaders with various sacrifices,
which were all very ghastly because they were inspired by the desire to
kill animals.
PURPORT
In this verse the great sage Narada discloses that the character of
Puranjana was being described to give lessons to King Pracinabarhisat.
Actually the entire description was figuratively describing the activities of
King Pracinabarhigat. In this verse Narada frankly says ‘like you”
(yatha bhavan), which indicates that King Puraiijana is none other
than King Pracinabarhigsat himself. Being a great Vaisnava, Narada
Muni wanted to stop animal killing in sacrifices. He knew that if
he tried to stop the King from performing sacrifices, the King would not
hear him. Therefore he is describing the life of Purafijana. But in this
verse he first discloses the intention, although not fully, by saying “like
you.” Generally the karmis, who are attached to increasing descendants,
have to perform so many sacrifices and worship so many demigods for
future generations, as well as to satisfy so many leaders, politicians,
philosophers and scientists to make things go on properly for future
generations. The so-called scientists are very eager to see that future
generations will live very comfortably, and as such they are trying to find


--- Page 129 ---
Text 11] Attack by Candavega on the City of Puraiijana 1263
different means of generating energy to drive locomotives, cars, airplanes
and so on. Now they are exhausting the petroleum supply. These activities
are described in the Bhagavad-gita.
vyavasayatmika buddhir
ekeha kuru-nandana
bahu-$akha hy anantas ca
buddhayo vyavasdyinam
“Those who are on this path are resolute in purpose, and their aim is one.
O beloved child of the Kurus, the intelligence of those who are irresolute
is many-branched.” (Bg. 2.41)

Actually those who are in knowledge of everything are determined to
execute Krsna consciousness, but those who are rascals (midhah), sinners
(duskrtinah) and the lowest of mankind (naradhamah ), who are bereft of
all intelligence (mayayapahrta-jianah) and who take shelter of the
demoniac way of life (asuram bhavam asritah), are disinterested in Krsna
consciousness. As such they become implicated and take on so many
activities. Most of these activities center around the killing of animals.
Modern civilization is centered around animal killing. Karmis are advertising
that without eating meat, their vitamin value or vitality will be reduced;
so to keep oneself fit to work hard, one must eat meat, and to digest
meat, one must drink liquor, and to keep the balance of drinking wine and
eating meat, one must have sufficient sexual intercourse to keep fit to
work very hard like an ass.

There are two ways of animal killing. One way is in the name of
religious sacrifices. All the religions of the world—except the Buddhists—
have a program for killing animals in places of worship. According to
Vedic civilization, the animal-eaters are recommended to sacrifice a goat
in the temple of goddess Kali under certain restrictive rules and regulations
and eat the flesh. Similarly, they are recommended to drink wine by wor-
shiping the goddess Candika. The purpose is restriction. People have given
up all this restriction. Now they are regularly opening wine distilleries
and slaughterhouses and indulging in drinking alcohol and eating flesh. A
Vaisnava acarya like Narada Muni knows very well that persons engaged
in such animal killing in the name of religion are certainly becoming
involved in the cycle of birth and death, forgetting the real aim of life: to
go home, back to Godhead.

Thus the great sage Narada, while instructing Srimad-Bhagavatam to
Vyasa Muni, condemned the karma-kanda (fruitive) activities mentioned
in the Vedas. Narada told Vyasa:


--- Page 130 ---
1264 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 27
jugupsitam dharma-krte ’nusasatah
sva-bhava-raktasya mahan vyatikramah
yad-vakyato dharma ititarah sthito
na manyate tasya nivaranam janah
“The people in general are naturally inclined to enjoy, and you have
encouraged them in that way in the name of religion. This is verily con-
demned and is quite unreasonable. Because they are guided under your
instructions, they will accept such activities in the name of religion and
will hardly care for prohibitions.” (Bhag. 1.5.15)

Srila Narada Muni chastised Vyasadeva for compiling so many Vedic
supplementary scriptures, which are all intended for guiding the people in
general. Narada Muni condemned these scriptures because they do not
mention direct devotional service. Under Narada’s instructions, direct
worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as described in the
Srimad-Bhagavatam, was set forth by Vyasadeva. The conclusion is that
neither the Supreme Personality of Godhead Visnu nor His devotee ever
sanctions animal killing in the name of religion. Indeed, Krsna incarnated
Himself as Lord Buddha to put an end to animal killing in the name of
religion. Animal sacrifice under the name of religion is conducted by the
influence of tamo-guna (the mode of ignorance), as indicated in the
Eighteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gita.

yaya dharmam adharmam ca
karyam cakaryam eva ca
ayathavat prajanati
buddhih sa partha rajasi
adharmam dharmam iti ya

“And that understanding which cannot distinguish between the religious
way of life and the irreligious, between action that should be done and
action that should not be done—that imperfect understanding, O son of
Prtha, is in the mode of passion. That understanding which considers
irreligion to be religion and religion to be irreligion, under the spell of
illusion and darkness, and strives always in the wrong direction, O Partha,
is in the mode of ignorance.” (Bg. 18.31-32)


--- Page 131 ---
Text 12] Attack by Candavega on the City of Purarijana 1265
Those who are involved in the mode of ignorance manufacture religious
et for killing animals. Actually dharma is transcendental. As Lord
ri Krsna teaches, we must give up all other systems of religion and simply
surrender unto Him (sarva-dharman parityajya). Thus the Lord and His
devotees and representatives teach the transcendental dharma, which does
not allow animal killing at all. At the present moment it is the greatest
misfortune that in India many so-called missionary workers are spreading
irreligion in the name of religion. They claim an ordinary human being to
be God and recommend meat-eating for everyone, including so-called
sannyasis.

TRANSLATION
Thus King Puraiijana, being attached to fruitive activities [karma-
kandiya] as well as kith and kin, and being obsessed with polluted con-
sciousness, eventually arrived at that point not very much liked by those
who are overly attached to material things.
PURPORT
In this verse the words priya-yositam and apriyah are very significant.
The word yosit means woman, and priya means dear or pleasing. Death
is not very much welcome for those who are too much attached to
material enjoyment, which culminates in sex. There is an instructive story
in this connection. Once when a saintly person was passing on his way, he
met a prince, the son of a king, and he blessed him, saying, “My dear


--- Page 132 ---
1266 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 27
prince, may you live forever.” The sage next met a saintly person, and he
said to him, “You may either live or die.” Eventually the sage met a
brahmacari devotee, and he blessed him, saying, “My dear devotee, you
may die immediately.” Finally the sage met a hunter, and he blessed him,
saying, “Neither live nor die.” The point is that those who are very sensual
and are engaged in sense gratification do not wish to die. Generally a
prince has enough money to enjoy his senses; therefore the great sage said
that he should live forever, for as long as he lived he could enjoy life, but
after his death he would go to hell. Since the brahmacari devotee was
leading a life of severe austerities and penances in order to be promoted
back to Godhead, the sage said that he should die immediately so that
he need not continue to labor hard and could instead go back home, back
to Godhead. A saintly person may either live or die, for during his life he
is engaged in serving the Lord, and after his death he also serves the Lord.
Thus this life and the next are the same for a saintly devotee, for in both
he serves the Lord. Since the hunter lives a very ghastly life due to killing
animals, and since he will go to hell when he dies, he is advised to neither
live nor die.

King Purafijana finally arrived at the point of old age. In old age the
senses lose their strength, and although an old man desires to enjoy his
senses and especially sex life, he is very miserable because his instruments
of enjoyment no longer function. Such sensualists are never prepared for
death. They simply want to live on and on and extend their life by so-called
scientific advancement. Some foolish Russian scientists also claim that
they are going to make man immortal through scientific advancement.
Under the leadership of such crazy fellows, civilization is going on. Cruel
death, however, comes and takes all of them away despite their desire to
live forever. This type of mentality was exhibited by Hiranyakasipu, but
when the time was ripe, the Lord personally killed him within a second.

TRANSLATION

O King! In Gandharvaloka there is a king named Candavega. Under

him there are 360 very powerful Gandharva soldiers.
PURPORT

Time is figuratively described here as Candavega. Since time and tide
wait for no man, time is herein called Candavega, which means “very
swiftly passing away.” As time passes, it is calculated in terms of years.
One year contains 360 days, and the soldiers of Candavega herein
mentioned represent these days. Time passes swiftly; Candavega’s powerful
soldiers of Gandharvaloka very swiftly carry away all the days of our life.
As the sun rises and sets, it snatches away the balance of our life span.
Thus as each day passes, each one of us loses some of life’s duration. It is
therefore said that the duration of one’s life cannot be saved. But if one
is engaged in devotional service, his time cannot be taken away by the
sun. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam: ayur harati vai pumsam udyann
astam ca yann asau (Bhag. 2.3.17). The conclusion is that if one wants to
make himself immortal, he should give up sense gratification. By engaging
oneself in devotional service, one can gradually enter into the eternal
kingdom of God.

Mirages and other illusory things are sometimes called Gandharvas. Our
losing our life span is taken as advancement of age. This imperceptible
passing away of the days of life is figuratively referred to in this verse as
Gandharvas. As explained in later verses, such Gandharvas are both male
and female. This indicates that both men and women lose their life span
imperceptibly by the force of time, which is herein described as Candavega.

TRANSLATION

Along with Candavega were as many female Gandharvis as there were
soldiers, and all of them repetitively plundered all the paraphernalia for
sense enjoyment.

PURPORT

The days have been compared to the soldiers of Candavega. Night is
generally a time for sex enjoyment. Days are considered to be white, and
nights are considered to be black, or, from another point of view, there
are two kinds of nights—black nights and white nights. All these days and
nights combine to pass away our span of life and everything we manu-
facture for sense gratification. Material activity means manufacturing
things for sense gratification. Scientists are conducting research to find
out how we can satisfy our senses more and more elaborately. In this
Kali-yuga, the demoniac mentality is employed in manufacturing various
machines to facilitate the process of sense gratification. There are so many
machines for ordinary household activities. There are machines for washing
dishes, cleansing the floor, shaving, clipping hair—today everything is done
by machine. All these facilities for sense gratification are described in this
verse as sarva-kama-vinirmitam. The time factor, however, is so strong that
not only is our span of life being expended, but all the machines and
facilities for sense gratification are deteriorating. Therefore in this verse
the word vilumpanti (plundering) is used. Everything is being plundered
from the very beginning of our lives.

This plundering of our possessions and life span begins with the day of
our birth. One day will come when death will finish everything, and the
living entity will have to enter another body to begin another chapter of
life and again begin the cycle of material sense gratification. Prahlada
Maharaja describes this process as punah punas carvita-carvananam
(Bhag. 7.5.30). Materialistic life means chewing the chewed again and
again. The central point of material life is sense gratification. In different
types of bodies, the living entity enjoys various senses, and through


--- Page 135 ---
Text 16] Attack by Candavega on the City of Puraifijana 1269
creating various types of facilities, he chews the chewed. Whether we
squeeze sugar out of the sugar cane with our teeth or a machine, the
result is the same—sugar cane juice. We may discover many ways to
squeeze the juice out of the sugar cane, but the result is the same.

TRANSLATION
When King Gandharva-raja [Candavega] and his followers began to
plunder the city of Purafjana, a snake with five hoods began to defend
the city.
PURPORT
When one is sleeping, the life air remains active in different dreams.
The five hoods of the snake indicate that the life air is surrounded by five
kinds of air known as prana, apana, vyana, udana and samana. When the
body is inactive, the prana, or the life air, is active. Up to the age of fifty
one can actively work for sense gratification, but after the fiftieth year
one’s energy decreases, although one can with great strain work for two or
three more years—perhaps up to the fifty-fifth year. Thus the fifty-fifth
year is generally taken by government regulations as the final year for re-
tirement. The energy, which is fatigued after fifty years, is figuratively
described herein as a serpent with five hoods.

TRANSLATION
The five-hooded serpent, the superintendent and protector of the city
of King Puranjana, fought with the Gandharvas for one hundred years. He
fought alone, with all of them, although they numbered 720.
PURPORT
The 360 days and 360 nights combine to become the 720 soldiers of
Candavega (time). One has to fight these soldiers throughout one’s lifespan,
beginning with birth and ending with death. This fight is called the struggle
for existence. Despite this struggle, however, the living entity does not die.
As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita, the living entity is eternal:
na jayate mriyate va kadacin
nayam bhitva bhavita va na bhiyah
ajo nityah sasvato yam purano
na hanyate hanyamane sarire
“For the soul there is never birth nor death. Nor, having once been, does he
ever cease to be. He is unborn, eternal, ever-existing, undying and primeval.
He is not slain when the body is slain.” (Bg. 2.20) Actually the living entity
does not take birth nor does he die, but he has to fight with the stringent
laws of material nature throughout the entire span of his lifetime. He must
also face different kinds of miserable conditions. Despite all this, the living
entity, due to illusion, thinks that he is well situated in sense gratification.

TRANSLATION

Because he had to fight alone with so many soldiers, all of whom were
great warriors, the serpent with five hoods became very weak. Seeing that
his most intimate friend was weakening, King Puranjana and his friends
and citizens living within the city all became very anxious.

PURPORT

The living entity resides within the body and struggles for existence with
the limbs of the body, which are referred to here as citizens and friends.
One can struggle alone with many soldiers for some time, but not for all
time. The living entity within the body can struggle up to the limit of a
hundred years with good luck, but after that it is not possible to prolong
the struggle. Thus the living entity submits and falls victim. In this regard,
Srila Bhaktivinoda Thikura has sung: vrddha kala 2010 saba sukha bhagala.
When one becomes old, it becomes impossible to enjoy material happiness.
Generally people think that religion and piety come at the end of life, and
at this time one generally becomes meditative and takes to some so-called
yogic process to relax in the name of meditation. Meditation, however, is
simply a farce for those who have enjoyed life in sense gratification. As
described in the Sixth Chapter of Bhagavad-gita, meditation (dhyana,
dharana) is a difficult subject matter that one has to learn from his very
youth. To meditate, one must restrain himself from all kinds of sense
gratification. Unfortunately, meditation has now become a fashion for
those who are overly addicted to sensual things. Such meditation is defeated
by the struggle for existence. Sometimes such meditative processes pass for
transcendental meditation. King Purarijana, the living entity, being thus
victimized by the hard struggle for existence, took to transcendental
meditation with his friends and relatives.

King Puranjana collected taxes in the city known as Paricala and thus
was able to engage in sexual indulgence. Being completely under the control
of women, he could not understand that his life was passing away and
that he was reaching the point of death.

PURPORT

Government men—including kings, presidents, secretaries and ministers—
are in a position to utilize taxes collected from the citizens for sense
gratification. It is stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam that in this Kali-yuga
government men (rajanyas) and those connected with the government, as
well as exalted government ministers, secretaries and presidents, will all
simply collect taxes for sense gratification. The government is top-heavy,
and without increasing taxes the government cannot maintain itself. When
taxes are collected, they are utilized for the sense gratification of the govern-
mental officials. Such irresponsible politicians forget that there is a time
when death will come to take away all their sense gratification. Some of
them are convinced that after life everything is finished. This atheistic
theory was conceived long ago by a philosopher called Carvaka. Carvaka
recommended that man should live very opulently by either begging,
borrowing or stealing. He also maintained that one should not be afraid
of death, the next life, the past life, or an impious life because after the
body is burned to ashes, everything is finished. This is the philosophy of

those who are too much materially addicted. Such philosophizing will not
save one from the danger of death, nor will it save one from an abominable
afterlife.

TRANSLATION
My dear King Pracinabarhisat, at this time the daughter of formidable
Time was seeking her husband throughout the three worlds. Although no
one agreed to accept her, she came.
PURPORT
In due course of time, when the body becomes old and practically invalid,
it is called jara, subject to the sufferings of old age. There are four basic
kinds of suffering—birth, old age, disease and death. No scientist or philoso-
pher has ever been able to make a solution of these four miserable
conditions. The invalidity of old age known as jara is figuratively explained
here as the daughter of Time. No one likes her, but she is very much anxious
to accept anyone as her husband. No one likes to become old and invalid,
but this is inevitable for everyone.

daurbhagyena—on account of misfortune; atmanah—of herself; loke—in
the world; visruta—celebrated; durbhaga—most unfortunate; iti—thus; sa—
she; ya—who; tusta—being satisfied; raja-rsaye—unto the great king; tu—
but; vrtdi—being accepted; addt—delivered; pirave—unto King Piru;
varam—benediction.

TRANSLATION

The daughter of Time [jara] was very unfortunate. Consequently she
was known as durbhaga [ill-fated]. However, she was once pleased with a
great king, and because the king accepted her, she granted him a great
benediction.

PURPORT

As Bhaktivinoda Thakura sings: saba sukha bhagala. All kinds of
happiness disappear in old age. Consequently no one likes old age, or jara.
Thus jara, as the daughter of Time, is known as a most unfortunate daughter.
She was, however, at one time accepted by a great king, Yayati. Yayati
was cursed by his father-in-law Sukracarya to accept her.When Sukracirya’s
daughter was married to King Yayati, one of her friends named Sarmistha
went with her. Later King Yayati became very much attached to Sarmistha,
and Sukracarya’s daughter complained to her father. Consequently
Sukracarya cursed King Yayati to become prematurely old. King Yayati
had five youthful sons, and he begged all his sons to exchange their youth
for his old age. No one agreed except the youngest son, whose name was
Piru. Upon accepting Yayati’s old age, Piru was given the kingdom. It
is said that two of Yayati’s other sons, being disobedient to their father,
were given kingdoms outside of India, most probably Turkey and Greece.
The purport is that one can accumulate wealth and all kinds of material
opulences, but during old age one cannot enjoy them. Although Piru
attained his father’s kingdom, he could not enjoy all the opulence because
he had sacrificed his youth. One should not wait for old age in order to
become Krsna conscious. Due to the invalidity of old age, one cannot make
progress in Krsna consciousness, however opulent he may be materially.

TRANSLATION
When I once came to this earth from Brahmaloka, the highest planetary
system, the daughter of Time, wandering over the universe, met me.
Knowing me to be an avowed brahmacari, she became lusty and proposed
that I accept her.
PURPORT
The great sage Narada Muni was a naisthika-brahmacari—that is, he
never had sex life. He was consequently an ever-green youth. Old age,
jara, could not attack him. The invalidity of old age can overcome an
ordinary man, but Narada Muni was different. Taking Narada Muni to be
an ordinary man, the daughter of Time confronted him with her lusty
desire. It requires great strength to resist a woman's attraction. It is
difficult for old men, and what to speak of young. Those who live as
brahmacaris must follow in the footsteps of the great sage Narada Muni,
who never accepted the proposals of jara. Those who are too much
sexually addicted become victims of jara, and very soon their life span is
shortened. Without utilizing the human form of life for Krsna conscious-
ness the victims of jara die very soon in this world.

TRANSLATION
The great sage Narada continued: When I refused to accept her request,
she became very angry at me and cursed me severely. Because I refused her
request, she said that I would not be able to stay in one place for a long
time.
PURPORT
The great sage Narada Muni has a spiritual body; therefore old age,
disease, birth and death do not affect him. Narada is the most kind devotee
of the Supreme Lord, and his only business is to travel all over the universe
and preach God consciousness. In other words, his business is to make
everyone a Vaisnava. Under the circumstances, there is ordinarily no need
for him to stay in one place for more than the time he requires to preach.
Since by his own free will he is already traveling all over the universe, the
curse of the Kalakanya is described as fortunate. Like Narada Muni, many
other devotees of the Lord are engaged in preaching the glories of the
Lord in different places and in different universes. Such personalities are
beyond the jurisdiction of material laws.

TRANSLATION

After she was thus disappointed by me, with my permission she ap-
proached the King of the Yavanas, whose name was Bhaya, or fear, and
she accepted him as her husband.

PURPORT

Being the most perfect Vaisnava, Sri Narada Muni is always willing to
do good to others, even to one who curses him. Although Kalakanya, the
daughter of Time, was refused by Narada Muni, she was given a shelter.
Of course no one could give her shelter, but a Vaisnava gives shelter
somewhere to such an unfortunate girl. When jara, or old age, attacks,
everyone dwindles and deteriorates. In one stroke Narada Muni gave
shelter to Kalakanya and counterattacked the ordinary karmis. If one
accepts the instructions of Narada Muni, the ocean of fear (bhaya) can be
very quickly removed by the grace of that great Vaisnava.

--- Page 144 ---
1278 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 27
TRANSLATION

Approaching the King of the Yavanas, Kalakanya addressed him as a
great hero, saying: My dear sir, you are the best of the untouchables. Iam
in love with you, and I want you as my husband. I know that no one is
baffled if he makes friends with you.

PURPORT

The words yavananam rsabham refer to the King of the Yavanas. The
Sanskrit words yavana and mleccha apply to those who do not follow the
Vedic principles. According to the Vedic principles, one should rise early
in the morning, take bath, chant Hare Krsna, offer marigala-arati to the
Deities, study Vedic literature, take prasiada, and engage in dressing and
decorating the Deities. One must also collect money for the temple
expenditures, or if one is a householder he must go to work in accordance
with the prescribed duties of a brahmana, ksatriya, vaiSya or $iidra. In this
way one should live a life of spiritual understanding, and this is the Vedic
way of civilization. One who does not follow all these rules and regulations
is called a yavana or mleccha. One should not mistakenly think that these
words refer to certain classes of men in other countries. There is no
question of limitation according to nationalism. Whether one lives in
India or outside of India, he is called a yavana or mleccha if he does not
follow the Vedic principles. One who does not actually follow the hygienic
principles prescribed in the Vedic rules and regulations will be subjected
to many contagious diseases. Because the students in this Krsna conscious-
ness movement are advised to follow the Vedic principles, they naturally
become hygienic.

If a person is Krsna conscious, he can work like a young man even if he
is seventy-five or eighty years old. Thus the daughter of Kala (time) cannot
overcome a Vaisnava. Srila Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami engaged in writing
Caitanya-caritamrta when he was very old, yet he presented the most
wonderful literature of the activities of Lord Caitanya. Srila Riipa Gosvami
and Sanatana Gosvami began their spiritual lives at a very old age, that is,
after they retired from their occupations and family lives. Yet they
presented many valuable literatures for the advancement of spiritual life.
This is confirmed by Srila Srinivasa Acarya, who praised the Gosvamis in
this way:

nana-sastra-vicaranaika-nipunau sad-dharma-samsthapakau
lokanar hita-karinau tri-bhuvane manyau Saranyakarau


--- Page 145 ---
Text 25] Attack by Candavega on the City of Purarijana 1279

radha-krspa-padaravinda-bhajananandena mattalikau
vande ripa-sanatanau raghu-yugau $ri-jiva-gopalakau
“I offer my respectful obeisances unto the six Gosvamis, namely Sri
Sanatana Gosvami, Sri Ripa Gosvami, Sri Raghunatha Bhatta Gosvami,
Sri Raghunatha dasa Gosvami, Sri Jiva Gosvami and Sri Gopala Bhatta
Gosvami, who are very expert in scrutinizingly studying all the revealed
scriptures with the aim of establishing eternal religious principles for the
benefit of all human beings. Thus they are honored all over the three
worlds, and they are worth taking shelter of because they are absorbed in
the mood of the gopis and are engaged in the transcendental loving service
of Radha and Krsna.”

Thus jara, the effect of old age, does not harass a devotee. This is
because a devotee follows the instructions and the determination of Narada
Muni. All devotees are in the disciplic succession stemming from Narada
Muni because they worship the Deity according to Narada Muni’s direction,
namely the Narada-paficaratra or the pancaratrika-vidhi. A devotee follows
the principles of panicaratrika-vidhi as well as bhagavata-vidhi. Bhagavata-
vidhi includes preaching work—sravanari kirtanam vispoh—the hearing and
chanting of the glories of Lord Visnu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
The paicaratrika-vidhi includes arcanam vandanari dasyam sakhyam atma-
nivedanam. Because a devotee rigidly follows the instructions of Narada
Muni, he has no fear of old age, disease or death. Apparently a devotee
may grow old, but he is not subjected to the symptoms of defeat experi-
enced by a common man in old age. Consequently old age does not make
a devotee fearful of death, as a common man is fearful of death. When
1070, or old age, takes shelter of a devotee, Kalakanya diminishes the
devotee’s fear. A devotee knows that after death he is going back home,
back to Godhead; therefore he has no fear of death. Thus instead of
depressing a devotee, advanced age helps him become fearless and thus
happy.

TRANSLATION

One who does not give charity according to the customs or injunctions
of the scriptures and one who does not accept charity in that way are
considered to be in the mode of ignorance. Such persons follow the path
of the foolish. Surely they must lament at the end.

PURPORT
It is herein stated that one should strictly follow the scriptures if one
actually wants an auspicious life. The same is explained in Bhagavad-gita.
yah $astra-vidhim utsrjya
vartate kama-karatah
na sa siddhim avapnoti
na 5011077} na parani gatim
“But he who discards scriptural injunctions and acts according to his own
whims attains neither perfection, nor happiness, nor the supreme desti-
nation.” (Bg. 16.23) |

One who does not strictly follow the terms of the Vedic injunctions
never attains success in life or happiness. And what to speak of going
home, back to Godhead.

One §astric injunction holds that a householder, a kgatriya, or an adminis-
trative head should not refuse to accept a woman if she voluntarily requests
to become a wife. Since Kalakanya, the daughter of Time, was deputed
by Narada Muni to offer herself to Yavana-raja, the King of the Yavanas
could not refuse her. All transactions must be performed in light of the
$astric injunctions. The $astric injunctions are confirmed by great sages
like Narada Muni. As stated by Narottama dasa Thakura: sadhu-$astra-
guru-vakya, cittete kariya aikya. One should follow the principles of
saintly persons, scriptures and the spiritual master. In this way one is
sure to attain success in life. Kalakanya, the daughter of Time, presented
herself before the King of the Yavanas precisely in terms of sadhu, $astra
and guru. Thus there was no reason for not accepting her.

TRANSLATION
Kalakanya continued: O gentle one, I am now present before you to
serve you. Please accept me and thus show me mercy. It is a gentleman’s
greatest duty to be compassionate upon a person who is distressed.
PURPORT
Yavana-raja, the King of the Yavanas, could also refuse to accept
Kalakanya, daughter of Time, but he considered the request due to the
order of Narada Muni. Thus he accepted Kalakanya in a different way.
In other words, the injunctions of Narada Muni, or the path of devotional
service, can be accepted by anyone within the three worlds, and certainly
by the King of the Yavanas. Lord Caitanya Himself requested everyone to
preach the cult of bhakti-yoga all over the world, in every village and town.
Preachers in the Krsna consciousness movement have actually experienced
that even the yavanas and mlecchas have taken to spiritual life on the
strength of Narada Muni’s pancaratrika-vidhi. When mankind follows the
disciplic succession, as recommended by Caitanya Mahaprabhu, everyone
throughout the world will benefit.

TRANSLATION
After hearing the statement of Kalakanya, daughter of Time, the King
of the Yavanas began to smile and devise a means for executing his
confidential duty on behalf of providence. He then addressed Kalakanya
as follows.
PURPORT
In Caitanya-caritamrta it is said:
ekale 0070৫ krsna, ara saba bhrtya
yare yaiche nacaya, se taiche kare nrtya
(০০. Adi 5.142)
Actually the supreme controller is the Personality of Godhead, Krsna, and
everyone is His servant. Yavana-raja, the King of the Yavanas, was also a
servant of Krsna. Consequently he wanted to execute the purpose of Krsna
through the agency of Kalakanya. Although Kalakanya means invalidity
or old age, Yavana-raja wanted to serve Krsna by introducing Kalakanya
everywhere. Thus a sane person, by attaining old age, will become fearful
of death. Foolish people engage in material activities as if they will live
forever and enjoy material advancement, but actually there is no material
advancement. Under illusion people think that material opulence will
save them, but although there has been much advancement in material
science, the problems of human society —birth, death, old age and disease—
are still unsolved. Nonetheless foolish scientists are thinking that they
have advanced materially. When Kalakanya, the invalidity of old age,
attacks them, they become fearful of death, if they are sane. Those who
are insane simply don’t care for death, nor do they know what is going to
happen after death. They are under the wrong impression that after death
there is no life, and consequently they act very irresponsibly in this life

Text 29] Attack by Candavega on the City of Puranjana 1283
and enjoy unrestricted sense gratification. For an intelligent person, the
appearance of old age is an impetus to spiritual life. People naturally fear
impending death. The King of the Yavanas tried to utilize Kalakanya for
this purpose.

The King of the Yavanas replied: After much consideration, I have
arrived at a husband for you. Actually, as far as everyone is concerned,
you are inauspicious and mischievous. Since no one likes you, how can
anyone accept you as his wife?
PURPORT
After much consideration, the King of the Yavanas decided to make the
best use of a bad bargain. Kalakanya was a bad bargain, and no one liked
her, but everything can be used for the service of the Lord. Thus the King
of the Yavanas tried to utilize her for some purpose. The purpose has
already been explained—that is, Kalakanya as jara, the invalidity of old
age, can be used to arouse a sense of fearin people so that they will prepare
for the next life by engaging in Krsna consciousness.

TRANSLATION

This world is a product of fruitive activities. Therefore you may imper-
ceptibly attack people in general. Helped by my soldiers, you can kill
them without opposition.

PURPORT

The word karma-vinirmitam means “manufactured by fruitive activities.”
This entire material world, especially in these days, is the result of fruitive
activities. Everyone is fully engaged in decorating the world by highways,
motor cars, electricity, skyscrapers, industries, businesses, etc. All this
appears very nice for those who are simply engaged in sense gratification
and who are ignorant of spiritual identity. As described in Srimad-
Bhagavatam:

nitnam pramattah kurute vikarma
yad indriya-pritaya dprnoti
na sadhu manye yata atmano yam
asann api klesada asa dehah (Bhag. 5.5.4)

Those without knowledge of the spirit soul are mad after materialistic
activities, and they perform all kinds of sinful activities simply for sense
gratification. According to Rsabhadeva, such activities are inauspicious
because they force one to accept an abominable body in the next life.
Everyone can experience that although we try to keep the body in a
comfortable position, it is always giving pain and is subjected to the three-
fold miseries. Otherwise, why are there so many hospitals, welfare boards
and insurance establishments? Actually in this world there is no happiness.
People are simply engaged trying to counteract unhappiness. Foolish
people accept unhappiness as happiness; therefore the King of the Yavanas


--- Page 151 ---
Text 30] Attack by Candavega on the City of Puranijana 1285
decided to attack such foolish people imperceptibly by old age, disease,
and ultimately death. Of course, after death there must be birth; therefore
Yavana-raja thought it wise to kill all the karmis through the agency of
Kalakanya and thus try to make them aware that materialistic advancement
is not actually advancement. Every living entity is a spiritual being, and
consequently without spiritual advancement the human form of life is
ruined.

TRANSLATION

The King of the Yavanas continued: Here is my brother Prajvara. I now
accept you as my sister. I shall employ both of you, as well as my dangerous
soldiers, to act imperceptibly within this world.

PURPORT

Kalakanya was sent by Narada Muni to Yavana-raja so that she might
become his wife, but instead of accepting her as his wife, Yavana-raja
accepted her as his sister. Those who do not follow the Vedic principles
are unrestricted as far as sex life is concerned. Consequently they some-
times do not hesitate to have sex with their sisters. In this age of Kali there
are many instances of such incest. Although Yavana-raja accepted the
request of Narada Muni to show respect to him, he was nonetheless
thinking of illicit sex. This was due to his being the King of the yavanas
and mlecchas.

The word prajvarah is very significant, for it means “006 fever sent by
Lord Visnu.” Such a fever is always set at 107 degrees, the temperature


--- Page 152 ---
1286 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 27
at which a man dies. Thus the King of the mlecchas and yavanas requested
the daughter of Time, Kalakanya, to become his sister. There was no
need to ask her to become his wife because the yavanas and mlecchas do
not make distinctions as far as sex life is concerned. Thus one may out-
wardly be a sister, mother or daughter and still have sex. Yavana-raja’s
brother was Prajvara, and Kalakanya was invalidity itself. Combined and
strengthened by the soldiers of Yavana-raja—namely non-hygienic con-
ditions, illicit sex and ultimately a high degree of temperature to bring
on death—they would be able to smash the materialistic way of life. In
this connection it is significant that just as Narada was immune to the
attack of jar, or invalidity, similarly, jara, or the destructive force, cannot
attack any follower of Narada Muni or a pure Vaisnava.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fourth Canto, Twenty-
seventh Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “Attack by Capdavega
on the City of King Purafijana; the Character of Kalakanya.”

PURPORT
The period of life just prior to death is certainly very dangerous because
usually at this time people are attacked by the weakness of old age as well
as many kinds of disease. The diseases that attack the body are compared
here to soldiers. These soldiers are not ordinary soldiers, for they are

guided by the King of the Yavanas, who acts as their commander-in-chief.
The word dista-karinah indicates that he is their commander. When a man
is young, he does not care for old age but enjoys sex to the best of his
satisfaction, not knowing that at the end of life his sexual indulgence will
bring on various diseases, which so much disturb the body that one will
pray for immediate death. The more one enjoys sex during youth, the
more he suffersin old age.

TRANSLATION

Once the dangerous soldiers attacked the city of Puraiijana with great
force. Although the city was full of paraphernalia for sense gratification,
it was being protected by the old serpent.

PURPORT

As one’s body engages in sense gratification, it becomes weaker and
weaker daily. Finally the vital force becomes so weak that it is herein
compared to a weak serpent. The life air has already been compared to the
serpent. When the vital force within the body becomes weak, the body
itself also becomes weak. At such a time the death symptoms—that is, the
dangerous soldiers of death’s superintendent, Yamaraja—begin to attack
very severely. According to the Vedic system, before coming to such a
stage one should leave home and take sannyasa to preach the message of
God for the duration of life. However, if one sits at home and is served by
his beloved wife and children, he certainly becomes weaker and weaker

Text 3] Puraiijana Becomes a Woman in the Next Life 1289
due to sense gratification. When death finally comes, one leaves the body
devoid of spiritual assets. At the present time, even the oldest man in the
family does not leave home, being attracted by wife, children, money,
opulence, dwelling, etc. Thus at the end of life one worries about how his
wife will be protected and how she will manage the great family responsi-
bilities. In this way a man usually thinks of his wife before death. Accord-
ing to Bhagavad-gita:
yam yam vapi smaran bhavam
tyajaty ante kalevaram
tam tam evaiti kaunteya
sada tad-bhava-bhavitah
“Whatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body, that
state he will attain without fail.” (Bg. 8.6)

At the end of life, a person thinks of what he has done throughout his
whole life; thus he gets another body (dehantara) according to his thoughts
and desires at the end of life. One overly addicted to life at home naturally
thinks of his beloved wife at the end of life. Consequently in the next life
he gets the body of a woman, and he also acquires the results of his pious
or impious activities. In this chapter the acceptance of a woman’s body by
King Purarijana will be thoroughly explained.

purposes.

1290 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 28
PURPORT

At the fag end of life, when the invalidity of old age attacks a man, his
body becomes useless for all purposes. Therefore Vedic training dictates
that when a man is in his boyhood he should be trained in the process of
brahmacarya, that is, he should be completely engaged in the service of the
Lord and should not in any way associate with women. When the boy
becomes a young man, he marries between the ages of twenty and twenty-
five. When he is married at the right age, he can immediately beget strong
healthy sons. Now female descendants are increasing because young men
are very weak sexually. A male child will be born if the husband is sexually
stronger than the wife, but if the female is stronger, a female child will be
born. Thus it is essential to practice the system of brahmacarya if one
wishes to beget a male child when one is married. When one reaches the
age of fifty, he should give up family life. At that time one’s child should
be grown up so that the father can leave the family responsibilities to him.
The husband and wife may then go abroad to live a retired life and travel
to different places of pilgrimage. When both the husband and wife lose
their attachment for family and home, the wife returns home to live under
the care of her grown-up children and to remain aloof from family affairs.
The husband then takes sannyasa to render some service to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead.

This is the perfect system of civilization. The human form of life is
especially meant for God realization. If one is unable to take to the process
of Krsna consciousness from the very beginning of life, he must he trained
to accept these principles at the fag end of life. Unfortunately, there is no
training even in childhood, nor can one give up his family life even at the
end. This is the situation with the city of Puranjana, figuratively described
in these verses.

TRANSLATION

When Kalakanya, daughter of Time, attacked the body, the dangerous
soldiers of the King of the Yavanas entered the city through different
gates. They then began to give severe trouble to all the citizens.

PURPORT

The body has nine gates—the two eyes, two nostrils, two ears, mouth,
rectum and genitals. When one is harassed by the invalidity of old age,
various diseases manifest at the gates of the body. For example, the eyes
become so dim that one requires spectacles, and the ears become too weak
to hear directly, and therefore one requires hearing aids. The nostrils are
blocked by mucus, and one has to always sniff a medicinal bottle contain-
ing ammonia. Similarly, the mouth, too weak to chew, requires false teeth.
The rectum also gives one trouble, and the evacuation process becomes
difficult. Sometimes one has to take enemas and sometimes use a surgical
nozzle to accelerate the passing of urine. In this way the city of Puranjana
was attacked at various gates by the soldiers. Thus in old age all the gates
of the body are blocked by so many diseases, and one has to take help
from so many medicines.

1292 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 28
TRANSLATION

When the city was thus endangered by the soldiers and Kalakanya, King
Puranjana, being overly absorbed in affection for his family, was placed in
difficulty by the attack of Yavana-raja and Kalakanya.

PURPORT

When we refer to the body, we include the external gross body with its
various limbs, as well as the mind, intelligence and ego. In old age these all
become weak when they are attacked by different diseases. The proprietor
of the body, the living soul, becomes very sad at not being able to use the
field of activities properly. In Bhagavad-gita it is clearly explained that the
living entity is the proprietor of this body (ksetra-jia) and that the body
is the field of activities (ksetra). When a field is overgrown with thorns and
weeds, it becomes very difficult for the owner to work it. That is the
position of the spirit soul when the body itself becomes a burden due to
disease. Extra burdens are placed on the body in the form of anxiety and
general deterioration of the bodily functions.

TRANSLATION

When King Puraijana was embraced by Kalakanya, he gradually lost all
his beauty. Having been too much addicted to sex, he became very poor
in intelligence and lost all his opulence. Being bereft of all possessions, he
was conquered forcibly by the Gandharvas and the Yavanas.

PURPORT
When a personis attacked by the invalidity of old age and is still addicted
to sense gratification, he gradually loses all his personal beauty, intelligence
and good possessions. He thus cannot resist the forceful attack of the
daughter of Time.

TRANSLATION
King Puraiijana then saw that everything in his town was scattered and
that his sons, grandsons, servants and ministers were all gradually opposing
him. He also noted that his wife was becoming cold and indifferent.
PURPORT
When one becomes an invalid, his senses and organs are weakened. In
other words, they are no longer under one’s control. The senses and sense
objects then begin to oppose him. When a person is in a distressed condition,
even his family members—his sons, grandsons and wife—become dis-
respectful. They no longer are under the command of the master of the
house. Just as we wish to use our senses for sense gratification, the senses
also require strength from the body in reciprocation. A man keeps a family
for enjoyment, and similarly family members demand enjoyment from the
head of the family. When they do not receive sufficient money from him,
they grow disinterested and ignore his commands or desires. This is all due
to one’s being a krpana (miser). This word krpana, used in the sixth verse,
is in opposition to the word brahmana. In the human form of life one
should become a brahmana, which means that one should understand the


--- Page 160 ---
1294 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 28
constitutional position of the Absolute Truth, Brahman, and then engage
in His service as a Vaisnava. We get this facility in the human form of life,
but if we do not properly utilize this opportunity, we become a krpana,
miser. A miser is one who gets money but does not spend it properly. This
human form of life is especially meant for understanding Brahman, for
becoming a brahmana, and if we do not utilize it properly, we remain a
krpana. We can actually see that when one has money but does not spend
it, he remains a miser and is never happy. Similarly, when one’s intelligence
is spoiled due to sense gratification, he remains a miser throughout his life.

When King Puraiijana saw that all his family members, relatives, follow-
ers, servants, secretaries and everyone else had turned against him, he
certainly became very anxious. But, he could not counteract the situation
because he was thoroughly overwhelmed by Kalakanya.

PURPORT

When a person becomes weak from the attack of old age, the family
members, servants and secretaries do not care for him. He is then unable
to counteract this. Thus he becomes more and more anxious and laments
his frightful condition.

The objects of enjoyment became stale by the influence of Kalakanya.
Due to the continuance of his lusty desires, King Puranjana became very
poor in everything. Thus he did not understand the aim of life. He was still
very affectionate toward his wife and children, and he worried about
maintaining them.
PURPORT
This is exactly the position of present civilization. Everyone is engaged
in maintaining the body, home and family. Consequently everyone becomes
confused at the end of life, not knowing what spiritual life and the goal of
human life are. In a civilization of sense gratification, there cannot be
spiritual life because a person only thinks of this life. Although the next
life is a fact, no information is given about it.

TRANSLATION

The city of King Puranjana was overcome by the Gandharva and Yavana
soldiers, and although the King had no desire to leave the city, he was
circumstantially forced to do so, for it was smashed by Kalakanya.

PURPORT

The living entity, separated from the association of the Supreme Person-
ality of Godhead, tries to enjoy this material world. He is given a chance to
enjoy it in a particular type of body, beginning with the body of a Brahma
down to that of the microbe. From the Vedic history of creation we can
understand that the first living creature was Lord Brahma, who created the
seven great sages and other prajapatis to increase the universal population.
Thus every living entity, according to karma, his past desires and activities,
gets a particular type of body, from that of Brahma to that of a microbe
or germ in stool. Due to long association with a particular type of material
body and also due to the grace of Kalakanya and her maya, one becomes
overly attached to a material body, although it is the abode of pain. Even
if one tries to separate a worm from stool, the worm will be unwilling to
leave. It will again return to the stool. Similarly, a hog generally lives in a
very filthy state, eating stool, but if one tries to separate it from its con-
dition and give it a nice place, the hog will be unwilling. In this way if we
study each and every living entity, we will find that he will defy offers of a
more comfortable position. Although King Purafijana was attacked from all
sides, he was nonetheless unwilling to leave the city. In other words, the
living entity— whatever his condition—does not want to give up the body.
But he will be forced to give it up because, after all, this material body
cannot exist forever.

The living entity wishes to enjoy the material world in different ways,
and therefore by nature’s law he is allowed to transmigrate from one body
to another, exactly as a person transmigrates from the body of an infant,
to a child, to a boy, to a youth, to a man. This process is constantly going
on. At the last stage, when the gross body becomes old and invalid, the
living entity is reluctant to give it up, despite the fact that it is no longer
usable. Although material existence and the material body are not comfort-


--- Page 163 ---
Text 11] Puraiijana Becomes a Woman in the Next Life 1297
able, why does the living entity not want to leave? As soon as one gets a
material body, he has to work very hard to maintain it. He may engage in
different fields of activity, but whatever the case, everyone has to work
very hard to maintain the material body. Unfortunately, society has no
information of the soul’s transmigration. Because the living entity does not
hope to enter the spiritual kingdom of eternal life, bliss and knowledge, he
wants to stick to his present body, even though it may be useless. Conse-
quently the greatest welfare activity in this material world is the furthering
of this Krsna consciousness movement.

This movement is giving human society information about the kingdom
of God. There is God, there is Krsna, and everyone can return to God and
live eternally in bliss and knowledge. A Krsna conscious person is not afraid
of giving up the body because his position is always eternal. A Krsna
conscious person engages in the transcendental loving service of the Lord
eternally; therefore as long as he lives within the body, he is happy to
engage in the loving service of the Lord, and when he gives up the body, he
is also permanently situated in the service of the Lord. The saintly devotees
are always free and liberated, whereas the karmis, who have no knowledge
of spiritual life or the transcendental loving service of the Lord, are very
much afraid of giving up the rotten material body.

1298 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 28
PURPORT
According to the Vedic system, a dead body is set on fire, but before
death there is another fire or fever, which is called prajvara, or visnpu-
jvara. Medical science verifies that when one’s temperature is raised to 107
degrees, a man immediately dies. This prajvara, or high fever, at the last
stage of life places the living entity in the midst of a blazing fire.

TRANSLATION
When the city was set ablaze, all the citizens and servants of the King, as
well as all family members, sons, grandsons, wives and other relatives, were
within the fire. King Puraiijana thus became very unhappy.
PURPORT
There are many parts of the body—the senses, the limbs, the skin, the
muscles, blood, marrow, etc.—and all these are considered here figuratively
as sons, grandsons, citizens and dependents. When the body is attacked by
the visnu-jvara, the fiery condition becomes so acute that sometimes one
remains in a coma. This means that the body is in such severe pain that one
becomes unconscious and cannot feel the miseries taking place within the
body. Indeed, the living entity becomes so helpless at the time of death,
that, although unwilling, he is forced to give up the body and enter another.
In Bhagavad-gita it is stated that man may, by scientific advancement,


--- Page 165 ---
Text 13] Puranjana Becomes a Woman in the Next Life 1299
improve the temporary living conditions but that he cannot avoid the
pangs of birth, old age, disease and death. These are under the control of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead through the agency of material nature.
A foolish person cannot understand this simple fact. Now people are very
busy trying to find petroleum in the midst of the ocean. They are very
anxious to make provisions for the future petroleum supply, but they
do not make any attempts to ameliorate the conditions of birth, old age,
disease and death. Thus not knowing anything about his own future life, a
person in ignorance is certainly defeated in all his activities.

TRANSLATION

The city’s superintendent of police, the serpent, saw that the citizens
were being attacked by Kalakanya, and he became very aggrieved to see his
own residence set ablaze after being attacked by the Yavanas.

PURPORT

The living entity is covered by two different types of bodies—the gross
body and the subtle body. At death we can see that the gross body is
finished, but actually the living entity is carried by the subtle body to
another gross body. The so-called scientists of the modern age cannot see
how the subtle body is working in carrying the soul from one body to
another. This subtle body has been figuratively described as a serpent, or
the city’s police superintendent. When there is fire everywhere, the police
superintendent cannot escape either. When there is security and an absence


--- Page 166 ---
1300 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 28
of fire in the city, the police superintendent can impose his authority upon
the citizens, but when there is an all-out attack on the city, he is rendered
useless. As the life air was ready to leave the gross body, the subtle body
also began to experience pain.

As a serpent living within the cavity of a tree wishes to leave when there
is a forest fire, so the city’s police superintendent, the snake, wished to leave
the city due to the fire’s severe heat.
PURPORT
It becomes very difficult for snakes to leave a forest when there is a fire.
Other animals may flee due to their long legs, but serpents, only being able
to crawl, are generally burned in the fire. At the last stage, the limbs of the
body are not as much affected as the life air.

The limbs of the serpent’s body were slackened by the Gandharvas and
Yavana soldiers, who had thoroughly defeated his bodily strength. When he
attempted to leave the body, he was checked by his enemies. Being thus
baffled in his attempt, he began to cry loudly.
PURPORT
At the last stage of life, the different gates of the body are choked by
the effects of disease, which are caused by an imbalance of bile, mucus and
air. Thus the living entity cannot clearly express his difficulties, and sur-
rounding relatives hear the sound ‘“ghura ghura” from a dying man. In his
Mukunda-mala-stotra, King Kulasekhara states:
krsna tvadiya-pada-parikaja-panjarantam
adyaiva me viatu manasa-raja-hamsah
prana-prayana-samaye kapha-vata-pittaih
kanthavarodhana-vidhau smaranam kutas te
“My dear Krsna, please help me die immediately so that the swan of my
mind may be encircled by the stem of Your lotus feet. Otherwise at the time
of my final breath, when my throat is choked up, how will it be possible
for me to think of You?” The swan takes great pleasure in diving within
water and being encircled by the stem of the lotusflower. This entanglement
is sporting joy. If, in our healthy condition, we think of the lotus feet of
the Lord and die, it is most fortunate. In old age, at the time of death, the
throat sometimes becomes choked with mucus or blocked by air. At such a
time the sound vibration of Hare Krsna, the maha-mantra, may not come
out. Thus one may forget Krsna. Of course those who are strong in Krsna
consciousness cannot possibly forget Krsna at any stage because they are
accustomed to chanting the Hare Krsna mantra, especially when there is a
signal from death.

PURPORT
It is not infrequent for a person overly attached to the material body to
request a physician to prolong his life at least for some time. If the so-called
scientific physician is able to prolong one’s life for a few minutes through
the use of oxygen or other medicines, he thinks that he is very successful
in his attempts, although ultimately the patient will die. This is called the
struggle for existence. At the time of death both patient and physician still
think of prolonging life, although all the constituents of the body are
practically dead and gone.

TRANSLATION

King Puraiijana was overly attached to his family and conceptions of “I”
and “mine.” Because he was overly attracted to his wife, he was already
quite poverty-stricken. At the time of separation, he became very sorry.

PURPORT

It is clear in this verse that at the time of death thoughts of material
enjoyment do not go away. This indicates that the living entity, the soul,
is carried by the subtle body—mind, intelligence and ego. Due to false ego,
the living entity still wants to enjoy the material world, and for want of
material enjoyment he becomes sorry or sad. He still makes intellectual
plans to further his existence, and therefore, although he gives up the gross
body, he is carried by the subtle body to another gross body. The trans-
migration of the subtle body is never visible to material eyes; there-
fore when one gives up the gross body, we think that he is finished.
Plans for material enjoyment are made by the subtle body, and the gross
body is the instrument for enjoying these plans. Thus the gross body can
be compared to the wife, for the wife is the agent for all kinds of sense
gratification. Because of long association with the gross body, the living
entity becomes very sad to be separated from it. The mental activity of the
living entity obliges him to accept another gross body and continue his
material existence.

The Sanskrit word 5872 means “expansion.” Through the wife one expands
his various objects of attraction—sons, daughters, grandsons, and so on.
Attachment to family members becomes very prominent at the time of
death. One often sees that just before leaving his body a man may call for
his beloved son to give him charge of his wife and other paraphernalia. He
may say, “My dear boy, I am being forced to leave. Please take charge of
the family affairs.” He speaks in this way, not even knowing his destination.

TRANSLATION
King Puraiijana was anxiously thinking, “Alas, my wife is encumbered
by so many children. When I pass from this body, how will she be able to
maintain all these family members? Alas, she will be greatly harassed by
thoughts of family maintenance.”
PURPORT
All these thoughts of one’s wife indicate that the King was overly
engrossed with the thoughts of woman. Generally a chaste woman becomes
a very obedient wife. This causes a husband to become attached to his wife,
and consequently he thinks of his wife very much at the time of death.
This is a very dangerous situation, as is evident from the life of King
Purarijana. If one thinks of his wife instead of Krsna at the time of death,
he will certainly not return home, back to Godhead, but will be forced to
accept the body of a woman and thus begin another chapter of material
existence.

TRANSLATION
King Purarijana then began to think of his past dealings with his wife. He
recalled that his wife would not take her dinner until he had finished his,
that she would not take her bath until he had finished his, and that she
was always very much attached to him, so much so that if he would some-
times become angry and chastise her, she would simply remain silent and
tolerate his misbehavior.
PURPORT
A wife is always supposed to be submissive to her husband. Submission,
mild behavior and subservience are qualities in a wife which make a hus-
band very thoughtful of her. For family life it is very good for a husband
to be attached to his wife, but it is not very good for spiritual advancement.
Thus Krsna consciousness must be established in every home. If a husband
and wife are very much attached to one another in Krsna consciousness,
they will both benefit because Krsna is the center of their existence. Other-
wise, if the husband is too much attached to his wife, he becomes a woman
in his next life. The woman, being overly attached to her husband, becomes
a man in her next life. Of course, it is an advantage for a woman to become
a man, but it is not at all advantageous for the man to become a woman.

TRANSLATION

King Puraiijana continued thinking how, when he was in a state of
bewilderment, his wife would give him good counsel and how she would
become aggrieved when he was away from home. Although she was the
mother of so many sons and heroes, the King still feared that she would not
be able to maintain the responsibility of household affairs.

PURPORT
At the time of death King Purarijana was thinking of his wife, and this is
called polluted consciousness. As Lord Krsna explains in Bhagavad-gita:
mamaivamso jiva-loke
Jiva-bhitah sanatanah
manah sasthanindriyani
prakrti-sthani karsati
“The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental
parts. Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six
senses, which include the mind.” (Bg. 15.7)

The living entity is, after all, part and parcel of the Supreme Spirit,
Krsna. In other words, Krsna’s constitutional position and the living entity’s
constitutional position are the same qualitatively. The only difference is
that the living entity is eternally an atomic particle of the Supreme Spirit.
Mamaivamso jiva-loke jiva-bhiitah sanatanah. In this material world of con-
ditional life, the fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord, the individual
soul, is struggling due to his contaminated mind and consciousness. As part
and parcel of the Supreme Lord, a living entity issupposed to think of Krsna,
but here we see that King Puraijana (the living entity) is thinking of a
woman. Such mental absorption with some sense object brings about the
living entity’s struggle for existence in this material world. Since King
Purarijana is thinking of his wife, his struggle for existence in the material
world will not be ended by death. As revealed in the following verses,
King Puraiijana had to accept the body of a woman in his next life due to
his being overly absorbed in thoughts of his wife. Thus mental absorption
in social, political, pseudo-religious, national and communal consciousness
is cause for bondage. During one’s lifetime one has to change his activities
in order to attain release from bondage. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita:

yajiiarthat karmano ‘nyatra
loko ’yan karma-bandhanah


--- Page 173 ---
Text 20] Purarijana Becomes a Woman in the Next Life 1307
tad-artham karma kaunteya
mukta-sarigah samacara
“Work done as a sacrifice for Vignu has to be performed, otherwise work
binds one to this material world. Therefore, O son of Kunti, perform your
prescribed duties for His satisfaction, and in that way you will always remain
unattached and free from bondage.” (Bg. 3.9) If we do not change our
consciousness in this life, whatever we do in the name of social, political,
religious or communal and national welfare will be the cause of our bondage.
This means we have to continue in material conditional life. When the
mind and senses are engaged in material activities, one has to continue his
material existence and struggle to attain happiness. In each and every life,
one is engaged in the struggle to become happy. Actually no one in this
material world is happy, but the struggle gives a false sense of happiness.
A person must work very hard, and when he attains the result of his hard
work, he thinks himself happy. In the material world people do not know
what real happiness is. Real happiness is to be attained by transcendental
senses.

“In the stage of perfection called trance, or samadhi, one’s mind is com-
pletely restrained from material mental activities by practice of yoga. This
is characterized by one’s ability to see the self by the pure mind and to
relish and rejoice in the self. In that joyous state, oneis situated in boundless
transcendental happiness and enjoys himself through transcendental senses.
Established thus, one never departs from the truth, and upon gaining this


--- Page 174 ---
1308 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 28
he thinks there is no greater gain. Being situated in such a position, one is
never shaken, even in the midst of greatest difficulty. This indeed is actual
freedom from all miseries arising from material contact.” (Bg. 6.20-23)

Thus real happiness must be appreciated by one’s transcendental senses.
Unless one is purified, the transcendental senses are not manifest; therefore
to purify the senses one must take to Krsna consciousness and engage the
senses in the service of the Lord. Then there will be real happiness and
liberation.

It is stated in Bhagavad-gita:

Sariram yad avapnoti
yac capy utkramatiSvarah
grhitvaitani samyati
vayur gandhan ivasayat
“The living entity in the material world carries his different conceptions
of life from one body to another as the air carries aromas.” (Bg. 15.8)

If the wind passes over a garden of roses, it will carry the aroma of
roses, and if it passes over a filthy place, it will carry the stench of
obnoxious things. Similarly, King Purainjana, the living entity, now passes
the air of his life over his wife, a woman; therefore he has to accept the
body of a woman in his next life.

continue their lives? Their position will be similar to that of passengers
aboard a ship wrecked in the midst of the ocean.”

PURPORT

At the time of death every living entity worries about what will happen
to his wife and children. Similarly, a politician also worries about what will
happen to his country or his political party. Unless one is fully Krsna
conscious, he has to accept a body in the next life according to his particu-
lar state of consciousness. Since Purarijana is thinking of his wife and chil-
dren and is overly engrossed in thoughts of his wife, he will accept the body
of a woman. Similarly, a politician or so-called nationalist who is inordi-
nately attached to the land of his birth will certainly be reborn in the same
land after ending his political career. One’s next life will also be affected
by the acts one performs during this life. Sometimes politicians act most
sinfully for their own sense gratification. It is not unusual for a politician
to kill the opposing party. Even though a politician may be allowed to
take birth in his so-called homeland, he still has to undergo suffering due
to his sinful activities in his previous life.

This science of transmigration is completely unknown to modern
scientists. So-called scientists do not like to bother with these things
because if they would at all consider this subtle subject matter and the
problems of life, they would see that their future is very dark. Thus they
try to avoid considering the future and continue committing all kinds of
sinful activities in the name of social, political and national necessity.

1310 Srimad-Bhagavatam [ Canto 4, Ch. 28
TRANSLATION

Although King Puranjana should not have lamented over the fate of his
wife and children, he nonetheless did so due to his miserly intelligence. In
the meantime, Yavana-raja, whose name was fear itself, immediately drew
near to arrest him.

PURPORT

Foolish people do not know that every individual soul is responsible for
his own actions and reactions in life. As long as a living entity in the form
of a child or boy is innocent, it is the duty of the father and mother to
lead him into a proper understanding of the values of life. When a child is
grown, it should be left up to him to execute the duties of life properly.
The parent, after his death, cannot help his child. A father may leave some
estate for his children’s immediate help, but he should not be overly
absorbed in thoughts of how his family will survive after his death. This is
the disease of the conditioned soul. Not only does he commit sinful activi-
ties for his own sense gratification, but he accumulates great wealth to
leave behind so that his children may also gorgeously arrange for sense
gratification.

In any case, everyone is afraid of death, and therefore death is called
bhaya, or fear. Although King Purafijana was engaged in thinking of his
wife and children, death did not wait for him. Death does not wait for any
man; it will immediately carry out its duty. Since death must take away
the living entity without hesitation, it is the ultimate God realization of the
atheists, who spoil their lives thinking of country, society and relatives, to
the neglect of God consciousness. In this verse the word atad-arhanam is
very significant, for it means that one should not be overly engaged in
welfare activities for one’s family members, countrymen, society and com-
munity. None of these will help a person to advance spiritually. Unfortu-
nately, in present day society so-called educated men have no idea what
spiritual progress is. Although they have the opportunity in the human form
of life to make spiritual progress, they remain misers. They use their lives
improperly and simply waste them thinking about the material welfare of
their relatives, countrymen, society and so on. One’s actual duty is to learn
how to conquer death. Lord Krsna states the process of conquering death
in Bhagavad-gita:

janma karma ca me divyam
evam yo vetti tattvatah

tyaktva deham punar janma
naiti mam eti so ‘rjuna


--- Page 177 ---
Text 23] Puraiijana Becomes a Woman in the Next Life 1311
“One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities
does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world,
but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.” (Bg. 4.9)

After giving up this body, one who is fully Krsna conscious does not
accept another material body but returns home, back to Godhead. Every-
one should try to attain this perfection. Unfortunately, instead of doing so,
people are absorbed in thoughts of society, friendship, love and relatives.
This Krsna consciousness movement, however, is educating people through-
out the world and informing them how to conquer death. Harim vina na
srtir taranti. One cannot conquer death without taking shelter of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION

When the Yavanas were taking King Puraiijana away to their place,
binding him like an animal, the King’s followers became greatly aggrieved.
While they lamented, they were forced to go along with him.

PURPORT

When Yamaraja and his assistants take a living entity away to the place
of judgment, the life, life air and desires, being followers of the living entity,
also go with him. This is confirmed in the Vedas. When the living entity is
taken away or arrested by Yamaraja (tam utkramantam), the life air also
goes with him (prano 78087277187), and when the life air is gone (pranam


--- Page 178 ---
1312 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 28
aniitkramantam), all the senses (sarve pranah) also go along (anitkramanti).
When the living entity and the life air are gone, the lump of matter produced
of five elements—earth, water, air, fire and ether—is rejected and left
behind. The living entity then goes to the court of judgment, and Yamaraja
decides what kind of body he is going to get next. This process is unknown
to modern scientists. Every living entity is responsible for his activities in
this life, and after death he is taken to the court of Yamaraja, where it is
decided what kind of body he will take next. Although the gross material
body is left, the living entity and his desires, as well as the resultant reactions
of his past activities, go on. It is Yamaraja who decides what kind of body
one gets next in accordance with one’s past actions.

TRANSLATION
The serpent, who had already been arrested by the soldiers of Yavana-
raja and was out of the city, began to follow his master along with the
others. As soon as they all left the city, it was immediately dismantled and
smashed to dust.
PURPORT
When the living entity is arrested, all his followers—namely the life air,
the senses and sense objects—immediately leave the lump of matter, the
body. When the living entity and his companions leave, the body no longer
works but turns into basic material elements—earth, water, fire, air and
ether. When a city attacked by enemies is vacated by its inhabitants, the
enemy immediately takes advantage of that city and bombards it to smash


--- Page 179 ---
Text 25] Puraijana Becomes a Woman in the Next Life 1313
the whole thing to dust. When we say, “Dust thou art, and unto dust thou
shall return,” we refer to the body. When a city is attacked and bombarded
by enemies, the citizens generally leave, and the city ceases to exist.

It is a foolish person who engages in improving the condition of a city
without caring for the citizens or inhabitants. Similarly, a living entity who
is not properly enlightened in spiritual knowledge simply takes care of the
external body, not knowing that the spirit soul is the principal factor
within the body. When one is advanced in spiritual knowledge, the spirit
soul is saved from eternal transmigration. The Bhagavatam considers those
who are attached to their bodies to be like cows and asses (sa eva go-kharah).
The cow is a very innocent animal, and the ass is a beast of burden. One
who labors under the bodily conception simply works like an ass and does
not know his self-interest. It is therefore said:

yasyatma-buddhih kunape tri-dhatuke
sva-dhih kalatradisu bhauma ijya-dhih
yat-tirtha-buddhih salile na karhicij
Jjanesv abhijiiesu sa eva go-kharah
“A human being who identifies this body made of three elements with his
self, who considers the by-products of the body to be his kinsmen, who
considers the land of birth as worshipable, and who goes to the place of
pilgrimage simply to take a bath rather than meet men of transcendental
knowledge there, is to be considered like an ass or a cow.” (Bhag. 10.84.13)

Human civilization devoid of Krsna consciousness is simply a civilization
of lower animals. Sometimes such a civilization may study the dead body
and consider the brain or the heart. However, no part of the body is im-
portant unless the spirit soul is present. In a modern civilization of cows
and asses, scientists try to search out some value in the brain or heart of a
dead man.

TRANSLATION

When King Purarijana was being dragged with great force by the powerful
Yavana, out of his gross ignorance he still could not remember his friend
and well-wisher, the Supersoul.

PURPORT
In Bhagavad-gita Lord Krsna says:
bhoktaram yajia-tapasam
sarva-loka-mahe$varam
suhrdan sarva-bhiitanam
jiatva mam santim rcchati
“The sages, knowing Me as the ultimate purpose of all sacrifices and
austerities, the Supreme Lord of all planets and demigods and the bene-
factor and well-wisher of all living entities, attain peace from the pangs of
material miseries.” (Bg. 5.29)

A person can be in full Krsna consciousness and become happy and
satisfied if he knows but three things—namely, that the Supreme Lord
Krsna is the enjoyer of all benefits, that He is the proprietor of everything,
and that He is the supreme friend of all living entities. If one does not know
this and functions instead under the bodily conception, he is always
harassed by the tribulations offered by material nature. In actuality, the
Supreme Lord is sitting by the side of everyone.

“The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone’s heart, O Arjuna, and is
directing the wanderings of all living entities, who are seated as on a
machine, made of the material energy.” (Bg. 18.61)

The living entity and the Supersoul are sitting side by side in the same

tree, but despite being harassed by the laws of material nature, the foolish


--- Page 181 ---
Text 26] Puraiijana Becomes a Woman in the Next Life 1315
living entity does not turn toward the Supreme Personality of Godhead for
protection. However, he thinks that he is able to protect himself from the
stringent laws of material nature. This, however, is not possible. The living
entity must turn toward the Supreme Personality of Godhead and surrender
unto Him. Only then will he be saved from the onslaught of the powerful
Yavana, or Yamaraja.

The word sakhayam (friend) is very significant in this verse because God
is eternally present beside the living entity. The Supreme Lord is also
described as suhrdam (ever well-wisher). The Supreme Lord is always a well-
wisher, just like a father or mother. Despite all the offenses of a son, the
father and mother are always the son’s well-wisher. Similarly, despite all
our offenses and defiance of the desires of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, the Lord will give us immediate relief from all the hardships
offered by material nature if we simply surrender unto Him. Lord Krsna
also confirms this in Bhagavad-gita:

daivi hy esa gunamayi
mama maya duratyaya
mam eva ye prapadyante
mayam etam taranti te
“This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material
nature, is difficult to overcome. But those who have surrendered unto Me
can easily cross beyond it.” (Bg. 7.14)

Unfortunately, due to our bad association and great attachment for
sense gratification, we do not remember our best friend, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION

That most unkind king, Puraijana, killed many animals in various
sacrifices. Now, taking advantage of this opportunity, all these animals
began to pierce him with their horns. It was as though he were being cut
to pieces by axes.

PURPORT

Those who are very enthusiastic about killing animals in the name of
religion or for food must await similar punishment after death. The word
mamsa (meat) indicates that those animals whom we kill will be given an
opportunity to kill us. Although in actuality no living entity is killed, the
pains of being pierced by the horns of animals will be experienced after
death. Not knowing this, rascals unhesitatingly go on killing poor animals.
So-called human civilization has opened many slaughterhouses for animals
in the name of religion or food. Those who are a little religious kill animals
in temples, mosques or synagogues, and those who are more fallen main-
tain various slaughterhouses. Just as in civilized human society the law is a
life for a life, similarly, no living entity can encroach upon another living
entity as far as the Supreme Lord is concerned. Everyone should be given
freedom to live at the cost of the Supreme Father, and animal killing—either
for religion or for food—is always condemned by the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. In Bhagavad-gita Lord Krsna says:

tan aham dvisatah kriran
samsaresu naradhaman
ksipamy ajasram asubhan
asurisv eva yonisu
“Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men,
are cast by Me into the ocean of material existence, into various demoniac
species of life.” (Bg. 16.19)

The animal killers (dvisatah), envying other living entities and the Su-
preme Personality of Godhead, are placed in darkness and cannot under-
stand the theme and objective of life. This is further explained in the
following verses.

ananta-pare—unlimitedly expanded; tamasi—in the material existence of
darkness; magnah—being merged; nasta-smrtih—bereft of all intelligence;
samah—for many years; §a§vatih— practically eternally; anubhiiya—experi-
encing; artim—the threefold miseries; pramada—of women; sariga—by

TRANSLATION

Due to his contaminated association with women, a living entity like
King Puraiijana eternally suffers all the pangs of material existence and
remains in the dark region of material life bereft of all remembrance for
many, many years.

PURPORT

This is a description of material existence. Material existence is experi-
enced when one becomes attached to a woman and forgets his real identity
as the eternal servant of Krsna (nasta-smrtih). In this way, in one body after
another, the living entity perpetually suffers the threefold miseries of
material existence. To save human civilization from the darkness of igno-
rance, this movement was started. The main purpose of the Krsna conscious-
ness movement is to enlighten the forgetful living entity and remind him of
his original Krsna consciousness. In this way the living entity can be saved
from the catastrophe of ignorance as well as bodily transmigration. As
Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura has sung:

anadi karama-phale, padi’ bhavarnava-jale,
taribare na dekhi upaya
€ visaya-halahale, diva-nisi hiya jvale,
mana kabhu sukha nahi paya

“Because of my past fruitive activities, I have now fallen into an ocean of
nescience. I cannot find any means to get out of this great ocean, which is
indeed like an ocean of poison. We are trying to be happy through sense
enjoyment, but actually that so-called enjoyment is like food that is too
hot and causes burning in the heart. I feel a burning sensation constantly,
day and night, and thus my mind cannot find satisfaction.”

1318 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 28

Material existence is always full of anxiety. People are always trying to
find many ways to mitigate anxiety, but because they are not guided by a
real leader, they try to forget material anxiety through drink and sex
indulgence. Foolish people do not know that by attempting to escape
anxiety by drink and sex, they simply increase their duration of material
life. It is not possible to escape material anxiety in this way.

The word pramada-sariga-disitah indicates that apart from all other
contamination, if one simply remains attached to a woman, that single
contamination will be sufficient to prolong one’s miserable material
existence. Consequently, in Vedic civilization one is trained from the
beginning to give up attachment for women. The first stage of life is
brahmacari, the second stage grhastha, the third stage vanaprastha, and the
fourth stage sannyasa. All these stages are devised to enable one to detach
himself from the association of women.

TRANSLATION

King Purarijana gave up his body while remembering his wife, and conse-
quently in his next life he became a very beautiful and well-situated woman.
He took his next birth as the daughter of King Vidarbha in the very house
of the King.

PURPORT

Since King Puranjana thought of his wife at the time of death, he
attained the body of a woman in his next birth. This verifies the following
verse in Bhagavad-gita:


--- Page 185 ---
Text 28] Puraiijana Becomes a Woman in the Next Life 1319
yam yam vapi smaran bhavam
tyajaty ante kalevaram
tam tam evaiti kaunteya
sada tad-bhava-bhavitah
“Whatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body, that
state he will attain without fail.” (Bg. 8.6)

When a living entity is accustomed to think of a particular subject
matter or become absorbed in a certain type of thought, he will think of
that subject at the time of death. At the time of death, one will think of
the subject that has occupied his life while he was awake, lightly sleeping
or dreaming, or while he was deeply sleeping. After falling from the
association of the Supreme Lord, the living entity thus transmigrates from
one bodily form to another according to nature’s course, until he finally
attains the human form. If he is absorbed in material thoughts and ignorant
of spiritual life, and if he does not take shelter under the lotus feet of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda, who solves all questions of
birth and death, he will become a woman in the next life, especially if he
thinks of his wife. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam: karmana daiva-
netrena. A living entity acts piously and impiously, and sometimes in both
ways. All actions are taken into account, and the living entity is offered a
new body by his superiors. Although King Purarijana was overly attached
to his wife, he nonetheless performed many pious fruitive activities.
Consequently, although he took the form of a woman, he was given a
chance to be the daughter of a powerful king. As confirmed in Bhagavad-
9 prapya punya-krtam lokan

usitva sasvatth samah
Sucinam Srimatam gehe
yoga-bhrasto ’bhijayate
“The unsuccessful yogi, after many, many years of enjoyment on the
planets of the pious living entities, is born into a family of righteous
people, or into a family of rich aristocracy.” (Bg. 6.41)

If a person falls from the path of bhakti-yoga, God realization, due
to attachment to fruitive activity, philosophical speculation or mystic
yoga, he is given a chance to take birth in a high and rich family. The
higher authorities appointed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead thus
render justice to the living entity according to the living entity’s desires.
Although King Puraiijana was overly absorbed in thoughts of his wife and
thus became a woman, he nonetheless took birth in the family of a king

1320 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 28
due to his previous pious activities. The conclusion is that all our activities
are taken into consideration before we are awarded another body. Narada
Muni therefore advised Vyasadeva to take to Krsna consciousness,
devotional service, and abandon all ordinary occupational duties. This
advice was also given by Lord Krsna Himself. Although a devotee may fall
from the path of spiritual consciousness, he will nonetheless attain a
human body in the home of a devotee or a rich man. In this way one can
resume his devotional service.

TRANSLATION

It was fixed that Vaidarbhi, daughter of King Vidarbha, was to be
married to a very powerful man, Malayadhvaja, an inhabitant of the
Pandu country. After conquering other princes, he married the daughter
of King Vidarbha.

PURPORT

It is customary among ksatriyas for a princess to be offered under certain
conditions. For instance, Draupadi was offered in marriage to one who
could pierce a fish with an arrow simply by seeing the reflection of that
fish. Krsna married one of His queens after conquering seven strong bulls.
The Vedic system is for a daughter of a king to be offered under certain
conditions. Vaidarbhi, the daughter of Vidarbha, was offered to a great


--- Page 187 ---
Text 30] Puranijana Becomes a Woman in the Next Life 1321
devotee and powerful king. Since King Malayadhvaja was both a powerful
king and great devotee, he fulfilled all the requirements. The name
Malayadhvaja signifies a great devotee who stands as firm as Malaya Hill,
and, through his propaganda, makes other devotees similarly as firm. Such
a maha-bhagavata can prevail over the opinions of all others. A strong
devotee makes propaganda against all other spiritual conceptions--namely
jiana, karma and yoga. With his devotional flag unfurled, he always stands
fast to conquer other conceptions of transcendental realization. Whenever
there is an argument between a devotee and a nondevotee, the pure, strong
devotee comes out victorious.

The word pandya comes from the word panda meaning knowledge.
Unless one is highly learned, he cannot conquer nondevotional conceptions.
The word para means transcendental, and pura means city. The para-pura
is Vaikuntha, the kingdom of God, and the word jaya refers to one who
can conquer. This means that a pure devotee, who is strong in devotional
service and who has conquered all nondevotional conceptions, can also
conquer the kingdom of God. In other words, one can conquer the king-
dom of God, Vaikuntha, only by rendering devotional service. The
Supreme Personality of Godhead is called ajita, meaning that no one can
conquer Him, but a devotee, by strong devotional service and sincere
attachment to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, can easily conquer
Him. Lord Krsna is fear personified for everyone, but He voluntarily
agreed to fear the stick of mother Yasoda. Krsna, God, cannot be con-
quered by anyone but His devotee. Such a devotee kindly married the
daughter of King Vidarbha.

TRANSLATION

King Malayadhvaja fathered one daughter, who had very black eyes. He
also had seven sons, who later became rulers of that tract of land known
as Dravida. Thus there were seven kings in that land.

PURPORT

King Malayadhvaja was a great devotee, and after he married the daughter
of King Vidarbha, he gave her one nice daughter, whose eyes were black.
Figuratively this means that the daughter of King Malayadhvaja was
bestowed also with devotional service, for her eyes were always fixed on
Krsna. A devotee has no vision in his life other than Krsna. The seven
sons are the seven processes of devotional service—hearing, chanting,
remembering, offering worship, offering prayers, rendering transcendental
loving service and serving the lotus feet of the Lord. Of the nine types of
devotional service, only seven were immediately given. The balance—
friendship and surrendering everything—were to be developed later. In
other words, devotional service is divided into two categories—namely
vidhi-marga and raga-marga. The process of becoming friends with the Lord
and sacrificing everything for Him belong to the category of raga-marga,
the stage of developed devotional service. For the neophyte, the important
processes are those of hearing and chanting (Sravanam kirtanam),
remembering Krsna, worshiping the Deity in the temple, offering prayers
and always engaging in the service of the Lord, and worshiping the lotus
feet of the Lord.

The word yaviyasah indicates that these processes are very powerful.
After a devotee engages in the processes of Sravanar kirtanam visnoh
smaranam padae-sevanam arcanam vandanam dasyam, and is able to secure
these processes, he can later become a devotee capable of rendering
spontaneous devotional service—namely sakhyam and atma-nivedanam.
Generally the great acaryas who preach devotional service all over the
world belong to the category of sakhyam atma-nivedanam. A neophyte
devotee cannot actually become a preacher. The neophyte is advised to
execute devotional service in the seven other fields (Sravanam kirtanam,
etc.). If one can successfully execute the preliminary seven items, he can
in the future be situated on the platform of sakhyam atma-nivedanam.

The specific mention of Dravida-desa refers to the five Dravida-desas
in south India. All are very strong in rendering the preliminary devotional
processes (Sravanarh kirtanam). Some great dcdryas, like Ramanujacarya
and Madhvacarya, also came from Dravida-desa and became great preachers.
These were all situated on the platform of sakhyam atma-nivedanam.

TRANSLATION
My dear King Pracinabarhisat, the sons of Malayadhvaja gave birth to
many thousands and thousands of sons, and all of these have been pro-
tecting the entire world up to the end of one Manu’s life span and even
afterwards.
PURPORT
There are fourteen Manus in one day of Brahma. A manvantara, the
life span of one Manu, is given as 71 multiplied by 4,320,000 years.
After one such Manu passes on, another Manu begins his life span. In this
way the life cy cle of the universe is going on. As one Manu follows another,
the cult of Krsna consciousness is being imparted, as confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita:
ॐ bhagavan ८८०४८८०
imam vivasvate yogam
proktavan aham avyayam
vivasvan manave praha
manur iksvakave ‘bravit
“The Blessed Lord said: I instructed this imperishable science of yoga to
the sun-god, Vivasvan, and Vivasvan instructed it to Manu, the father of
mankind, and Manu in turn instructed it to Ikgvaku.” (Bg. 4.1)
Vivasvan, the sun-god, imparted Bhagavad-gita to one Manu, and this
Manu imparted it to his son, who imparted it to yet another Manu. In this
way the propagation of Krsna consciousness is never stopped. No one


--- Page 190 ---
1324 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 28
should think that this Krsna consciousness movement is a new movement.
As confirmed by Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhdgavatam, it is a very, very
old movement, for it has been passing down from one Manu to another.

Among Vaisnavas there may be some difference of opinion due to
everyone’s personal identity, but despite all personal differences, the cult
of Krsna consciousness must go on. We can see that under the instructions
of Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami
Maharaja began preaching the Krsna consciousness movement in an
organized way within the past hundred years. The disciples of Srila
Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami Maharaja are all Godbrothers, and
although there are some differences of opinion, and although we are not
acting conjointly, still every one of us is spreading this Krsna consciousness
movement according to his own capacity and producing many disciples to
spread it all over the world. As far as we are concerned, we have already
started the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, and many
thousands of Europeans and Americans have joined this movement. Indeed,
it is spreading like wildfire. This cult of Krsna consciousness, based on the
nine principles of devotional service (Sravanam kirtanam vispoh smaranam
pada-sevanam/ arcanam vandanam dasyam sakhyam atma-nivedanam), will
never be stopped. It will go on without distinction of caste, creed, color or
country. No one can check it.

The word bhoksyate is very important in this verse. Just as a king
gives protection to his citizens, these devotees, following the principles of
devotional service, will give protection to all the people of the world. The
people of the world are very much harassed by so-called religious principled
svamis, yogis, karmis and jidnis, but none of these can show the right
way to become elevated to the spiritual platform. There are primarily four
parties spreading devotional service all over the universe. These are
the Ramanuja-sampradaya, the Madhva-sampradaya, the Vispusvami-
sampradaya and the Nimbarka-sampradaya. The Madhva-Gaudiya-
sampradaya in particular comes from Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu. All these
devotees are spreading this Krsna consciousness movement very widely
and giving protection to innocent people who are being so much
embarrassed by pseudo-avataras, svamis, yogis and others.

agastyah—the great sage Agastya Muni; prak—first; duhitaram— daughter;
upayeme—married; dhrta-vratam—taken to vows; yasy@m—through whom;
drdha-cyutah—named Drdhacyuta; jatah-was born; idhma-viha—-named
Idhmavaha; atma-jah—son; munih—the great sage.

TRANSLATION

The great sage named Agastya married the first-born daughter of
Malayadhvaja, the avowed devotee of Lord Krsna. From her one son was
born, whose name was Drdhacyuta, and from him another son was born,
whose name was Idhmavaha.

PURPORT

The name of Agastya Muni is very significant. The word agastya indicates
that his senses do not act independently, and the word muni means
“mind.” The mind is the center of all the senses, and in the case of
Agastya Muni, the senses could not work independent of the mind. When
the mind takes to the cult of bhakti, it engages in devotional service. The
cult of bhakti (bhakti-latd) is the first daughter of Malayadhvaja, and, as
previously described, her eyes are always upon Krsna (asiteksanam). One
cannot render bhakti to any demigod. Bhakti can be rendered only to
Vignu (Sravapam kirtanam vispoh). Thinking the Absolute Truth to be
without form, the Mayavadis say that the word bhakti can apply to any
form of worship. If this were the case, a devotee could imagine any
demigod or any godly form and worship it. This, however, is not the real
fact. The real fact is that bhakti can only be applied to Lord Vignu and His
expansions. Therefore bhakti-latd is drdha-vrata, the great vow, for when
the mind is completely engaged in devotional service, the mind does not
fall down. If one tries to advance by other means—by karma-yoga or
jiiana-yoga—one will fall down, but if one is fixed in bhakti, he never falls
down.

Thus from bhakti-lata the son Drdhacyuta is born, and from Drdhacyuta
the next son, Idhmavaha, is born. The word idhma-vdha refers to one who
carries wood for burning in a sacrifice when approaching a spiritual
master. The point is that bhakti-lata, the cult of devotion, fixes one in his


--- Page 192 ---
1326 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 28
spiritual position. One so fixed never comes down, and he begets children
who are strict followers of the §astric injunctions. As said in the Vedas:
tad vijianartham sa gurum evabhigacchet
samit-panih srotriyam brahma-nistham
In the line of devotional service, those who are initiated are strict followers
of the Vedic scriptural injunctions.

TRANSLATION
After this, the great saintly king Malayadhvaja divided his entire king-
dom amongst his sons. Then, in order to worship Lord Krsna with full
attention, he went to a solitary place known as Kulacala.
PURPORT
Malayadhvaja, the great king, was certainly a maha-bhagavata, topmost
devotee. By executing devotional service, he begot many sons and
disciples for propagating the bhakti cult (Sravanar kirtanarm visnoh).
Actually, the entire world should be divided amongst such disciples. Every-
one should be engaged in preaching the cult of Krsna consciousness. In
other words, when disciples are grown up and are able to preach, the
spiritual master should retire and sit down in a solitary place to write and
execute nirjana-bhajana. This means sitting silently in a solitary place and
executing devotional service. This nirjana-bhajana, which is the silent


--- Page 193 ---
Text 34] Puraiijana Becomes a Woman in the Next Life 1327
worship of the Supreme Lord, is not possible for a neophyte devotee.
Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thikura never advised a neophyte devotee
to go to a solitary place to engage in devotional service. Indeed, he has
written a song in this connection:
dusta mana, tumi kisera vaisnava?
pratisthara tare, nirjanera ghare,
tava hari-nama kevala kaitava
“My dear mind, what kind of devotee are you? Simply for cheap adoration
you sit in a solitary place and pretend to chant the Hare Krsna maha-mantra,
but this is all cheating.” Thus Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura advocated
that every devotee, under the guidance of an expert spiritual master,
preach the bhakti cult, Krsna consciousness, all over the world. Only
when one is mature can he sit in a solitary place and retire from preaching
all over the world. Following this example, the devotees of the International
Society for Krishna Consciousness now render service as preachers in various
parts of the world. Now they can allow the spiritual master to retire from
active preaching work. In the last stage of the spiritual master’s life, the
devotees of the spiritual master should take preaching activities into their
own hands. In this way the spiritual master can sit down in a solitary place
and render nirjana-bhajana.

were very enchanting, followed him, giving up all homely happiness,
despite family and children.

PURPORT

Just as in the vdnaprastha stage the wife follows the husband, similarly
when the spiritual master retires for nirjana-bhajana, some of his advanced
devotees follow him and engage in his personal service. In other words,
those who are very fond of family life should come forward in the service
of the spiritual master and abandon so-called happiness afforded by
society, friendship and love. A verse by Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti
Thakura in his Gurv-astaka is significant in this regard. Yasya prasadad
bhagavat-prasadah. A disciple should always remember that by serving the
spiritual master he can easily advance in Krsna consciousness. All the
scriptures recommend that it is by pleasing the spiritual master and serving
him directly that one can attain the highest perfectional stage of devotional
service.

The word madireksand is also significant in this verse. Srila Jiva Gosvami
has explained in his Sandarbha that the word madira means intoxicating.
If one’s eyes become intoxicated upon seeing the Deity, he may be
called madireksanpa. Queen Vaidarbhi’s eyes were very enchanting, just as
one’s eyes are madireksana when engaged in seeing the temple Deity.
Unless one is an advanced devotee, he cannot fix his eyes on the Deity in
the temple.

TRANSLATION

In the province of Kulacala, there were rivers named Candravasa,
Tamraparni and Vatodaka. King Malayadhvaja used to go to those pious
rivers regularly and take his bath there. Thus he purified himself externally
and internally. He took his bath and ate bulbs, seeds, leaves, flowers,
roots, fruits and grasses and drank water. In this way he underwent
severe austerities. Eventually he became very skinny.

PURPORT

We can definitely see that to advance in Krsna consciousness one must
control his bodily weight. If one becomes too fat, it is to be assumed that
he is not advancing spiritually. Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura
severely criticized his fat disciples. The idea is that one who intends to
advance in Krsna consciousness must not eat very much. Devotees used to
go to forests, high hills or mountains on pilgrimages, but such severe
austerities are not possible in these days. One should instead eat only
prasada and no more than required. According to the Vaisnava calendar,
there are many fasts, such as Ekadasi and the appearance and disappearance
days of God and His devotees. All of these are meant to decrease the fat
within the body so that one will not sleep more than desired and will not
become inactive and lazy. Overindulgence in food will cause a man to
sleep more than required. This human form of life is meant for austerity,
and austerity means controlling sex, food intake, etc. In this way time can
be saved for spiritual activity, and one can purify himself both externally
and internally. Thus both body and mind can be cleansed.

TRANSLATION

Through austerity, King Malayadhvaja in body and mind gradually
became equal to the dualities of cold and heat, happiness and distress,
wind and rain, hunger and thirst, the pleasant and the unpleasant. In this
way he conquered all relativities.

PURPORT

Liberation means becoming free from the relativities of the world. Unless
one is self-realized, he has to undergo the dual struggle of the relative world.
In Bhagavadgita Lord Krsna advises Arjuna to conquer all relativities
through tolerance. Lord Krsna points out that it is the relativities like
winter and summer that give us trouble in the material world. In the winter
we do not like taking a bath, but in the summer we wish to take a bath
twice, thrice or more a day. Thus Krsna advises us not to be disturbed by
such relativities and dualities when they come and go.

The common man has to undergo much austerity to become equipoised
before dualities. One who becomes agitated by the relativities of life has
accepted a relative position and must therefore undergo the austerities
prescribed in the $dstras to transcend the material body and put an end to
material existence. King Malayadhvaja underwent severe austerities by
leaving his home, going to Kulacala, taking his bath in the sacred rivers and
eating only vegetables like stems, roots, seeds, flowers and leaves, avoiding
any cooked food or grains. These are very, very austere practices. In this
age it is very difficult to leave home and go to the forest or the Himalayas
to adopt the processes of austerity. Indeed, it is almost impossible. If one
is even advised to give up meat-eating, drinking, gambling and illicit sex,
one will fail to do so. What, then, would a person do if he went to the
Himalayas or Kulacala? Such acts of renunciation are not possible in this
age; therefore Lord Krsna has advised us to accept the bhakti-yoga process.

Bhakti-yoga will automatically liberate a person from the dualities of life.
In bhakti-yoga, Krsna is the center, and Krsna is always transcendental.
Thus in order to transcend dualities, one must always engage in the service
of the Lord, as confirmed by Bhagavad-gita:
mam ca yo ’vyabhicdrena
bhakti-yogena sevate
sa gunan samatityaitan
brahma-bhityaya kalpate
“One who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any
circumstance, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus
comes to the level of Brahman.” (Bg. 14.26)

If one is factually engaged in the service of the Lord, bhakti-yoga, he will
automatically control his senses, his tongue and so many other things.
Once engaged in the bhakti-yoga process with all sincerity, one will have
no chance of falling down. Even if one falls down, there is no loss. One’s
devotional activities may be stunned or choked for the time being, but as
soon as there is another chance, the practitioner begins from the point
where he left off.

sciousness. Thus he fixed everything on the central point of the Supreme
Brahman [Krsna].
PURPORT
Whenever the word brahman appears, the impersonalists take this to
mean the impersonal effulgence, the brahmajyoti. Actually, however,
Parabrahman, the Supreme Brahman, is Krsna, Vasudeva. As stated in
Bhagavad-gita, vasudevah sarvam iti: Vasudeva extends everywhere as the
impersonal Brahman. One cannot fix one’s mind upon an impersonal “‘some-
thing.” Bhagavad-gita therefore says, kleso ’dhikataras tesam avyaktasakta-
cetasam: “For those whose minds are attached to the unmanifested, im-
personal feature of the Supreme, advancement is very troublesome.” (Bg.
12.5) Consequently when it is said herein that King Malayadhvaja fixed
his mind on brahman, “brahman” means the Supreme Personality of God-
head, Vasudeva.

“After many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders
unto Me, knowing Me to be the cause of all causes and all that is. Such a
great soul is very rare.” (Bg. 7.19)

Vasudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, is everything,
and one who knows this is the greatest of all transcendentalists. It is stated
in Bhagavad-gita that one realizes this after many, many births. This is also
confirmed in this verse with the words divyam varsa-satam (one hundred
years according to the calculations of the demigods). According to the
calculations of the demigods, one day (twelve hours) is equal to six months
on earth. A hundred years of the demigods would equal 36,000 earth
years. Thus King Malayadhvaja executed austerities and penances for 36,000
years. After this time, he became fixed in the devotional service of the
Lord. To live on earth for so many years, one has to take birth many times.
This confirms the conclusion of Krsna. To come to the conclusion of Krsna
consciousness and remain fixed in the realization that Krsna is everything,
as well as render service unto Krsna, are characteristics of the perfectional
stage. As said in Caitanya-caritamrta: krsne bhakti kaile sarva-karma
krta haya (Cc. Madhya 22.62). When one comes to the conclusion
that Krsna is everything by worshiping or by rendering devotional service
unto Krsna, one actually becomes perfect in all respects. Not only must
one come to the conclusion that Krsna is everything, but he must remain
fixed in this realization. This is the highest perfection of life, and it is this
perfection that King Malayadhvaja attained at the end.

TRANSLATION

King Malayadhvaja attained perfect knowledge by being able to distin-
guish the Supersoul from the individual soul. The individual soul is localized,
whereas the Supersoul is all-pervasive. He became perfect in knowledge
that the material body is not the soul but that the soul is the witness of the
material body.

PURPORT

The conditioned soul is often frustrated in trying to understand the
distinctions between the material body, the Supersoul and the individual
soul. There are two types of Mayavadi philosophers—the followers of the
Buddhist philosophy and the followers of the Saiikara philosophy. The
followers of Buddha do not recognize that there is anything beyond the
body; the followers of Sarikara conclude that there is no separate existence
of the Paramatma, the Supersoul. The Sarikarites believe that the individual
soul is identical with the Paramatma in the ultimate analysis. But the
Vaignava philosopher, who is perfect in knowledge, knows that the body is
made of the external energy and that the Supersoul, the Paramatma, the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, is sitting with the individual soul and is
distinct from him. As Lord Krsna states in Bhagavad-gita:

ksetrajiiari capi mam viddhi
sarva-ksetresu bharata
ksetra-ksetrajiiayor jianam
yat taj jianam matam mama
“O scion of Bharata, you should understand that I am also the knower in
all bodies, and to understand this body and its owner is called knowledge.
That is My opinion.” (Bg. 13.3)

The body is taken to be the field, and the individual soul is taken to be
the worker in that field. Yet there is another, who is known as the Super-
soul, who, along with the individual soul, simply witnesses. The individual
soul works and enjoys the fruits of the body, whereas the Supersoul simply
witnesses the activities of the individual soul but does not enjoy the fruits
of those activities. The Supersoul is present in every field of activity,
whereas the individual soul is present in his one localized body. King
Malayadhvaja attained this perfection of knowledge and was able to distin-
guish between the soul and the Supersoul and the soul and the material
body.

TRANSLATION

In this way King Malayadhvaja attained perfect knowledge because in
his pure state he was directly instructed by the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. By means of such enlightening transcendental knowledge, he
could understand everything from all angles of vision.

PURPORT

In this verse the words saksad bhagavatoktena guruna harina are very
significant. The Supreme Personality of Godhead speaks directly to the
individual soul when the devotee has completely purified himself by
rendering devotional service to the Lord. Lord Krsna confirms this also in
Bhagavad-gita:

tesam satata-yuktanam
bhajatam priti-parvakam
dadami buddhi-yogam tam
yena mam upayanti te
“To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give
the understanding by which they can come to Me.” (Bg. 10.10)

The Lord is the Supersoul seated in everyone’s heart, and He acts as the
caitya-guru, the spiritual master within. However, He gives direct instruc-
tions only to the advanced pure devotees. In the beginning, when a devotee
is serious and sincere, the Lord gives him directions from within to approach
a bona fide spiritual master. When one is trained by the spiritual master
according to the regulative principles of devotional service and is situated


--- Page 202 ---
1336 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 28
on the platform of spontaneous attachment for the Lord (raga-bhakti), the
Lord also gives instructions from within. Tesam satata-yuktanam bhajatar
priti-parvakam. This distinct advantage is obtained by a liberated soul.
Having attained this stage, King Malayadhvaja was directly in touch with
the Supreme Lord and was receiving instructions from Him directly.

TRANSLATION
King Malayadhvaja could thus observe that the Supersoul was sitting by
his side, and that he, as the individual soul, was sitting by the side of the
Supersoul. Since both were together, there was no need for separate
interests; thus he ceased from such activities.
PURPORT
In the advanced stage of devotional service, the devotee does not see any-
thing separate between his own interests and those of the Supreme Person-
ality of Godhead. Both interests become one, for the devotee does not act
for a separate interest. Whatever he does, he does in the interest of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. At that time he sees everything in the
Supreme Personality of Godhead and the Supreme Personality of Godhead
in everything. Having attained this stage of understanding, he sees no
distinction between the spiritual and material worlds. In perfect vision, the
material world becomes the spiritual world due to its being the external
energy of the Supreme Lord. For the perfect devotee, the energy and the
energetic are nondifferent. Thus the so-called material world becomes


--- Page 203 ---
Text 43] Puraiijana Becomes a Woman in the Next Life 1337
spiritual (sarvam khalv idam brahma). Everything is intended for the service
of the Supreme Lord, and the expert devotee can utilize any so-called
material thing for the Lord’s service. One cannot serve the Lord without
being situated on the spiritual platform. Thus if a so-called material thing is
dovetailed in the service of the Lord, it is no longer to be considered mate-
rial. Thus the pure devotee, in his perfect vision, sees from all angles.

TRANSLATION

The daughter of King Vidarbha accepted her husband all in all as the
Supreme. She gave up all sensual enjoyment and in complete renunciation
followed the principles of her husband, who was so advanced. Thus she
remained engaged in his service.

PURPORT

Figuratively, King Malayadhvaja is the spiritual master, and his wife,
Vaidarbhi, is the disciple. The disciple accepts the spiritual master as the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. As stated by Visvanatha Cakravarti
Thakura in Gurv-astaka, saksad-dharitvena: “One directly accepts the
guru, the spiritual master, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.” One
should accept the spiritual master not in the sense that the Mayavadi
philosophers do but in the way recommended here. Since the spiritual
master is the most confidential servant of the Lord, he should he treated
exactly like the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The spiritual master


--- Page 204 ---
1338 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 28
should never be neglected or disobeyed, like an ordinary person.

If a woman is fortunate enough to be the wife of a pure devotee, she can
serve her husband without any desire for sense gratification. If she remains
engaged in the service of her exalted husband, she will automatically attain
the spiritual perfections of her husband. If a disciple gets a bona fide
spiritual master, simply by sgtisfying him, he can attain a similar oppor-
tunity to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION

The daughter of King Vidarbha wore old garments, and she was lean and
thin because of her vows of austerity. Since she did not arrange her hair, it
became entangled and twisted in locks. Although she remained always near
her husband, she was as silent and unagitated as the flame of an undisturbed
fire.

PURPORT

When one begins to burn firewood, there is smoke and agitation in the
beginning. Although there are so many disturbances in the beginning, once
the fire is completely set, the firewood burns steadily. Similarly, when both
husband and wife follow the regulative principles of austerity, they remain
silent and are not agitated by sex impulses. At such a time both husband
and wife are benefited spiritually. One can attain this stage of life by
completely giving up a luxurious mode of life.

In this verse the word cira-vdsa refers to very old torn garments. The wife
especially should remain austere, not desiring luxurious dresses and living


--- Page 205 ---
Text 45] Purarijana Becomes a Woman in the Next Life 1339
standards. She should accept only the bare necessities of life and minimize
her eating and sleeping. There should be no question of mating. Simply by
engaging in the service of her exalted husband, who must be a pure devotee,
the wife will never be agitated by sex impulses. The vdnaprastha stage is
exactly like this. Although the wife remains with the husband, she under-
goes severe austerities and penances so that although both husband and wife
live together, there is no question of sex. In this way both husband and
wife can live together perpetually. Since the wife is weaker than the husband,
this weakness is expressed in this verse with the words upa patim. Upa
means “near to,” or “almost equal to.” Being a man, the husband is
generally more advanced than his wife. Nonetheless, the wife is expected
to give up all luxurious habits. She should not even dress nicely or comb
her hair. Hair combing is one of the main businesses of women. In the
vanaprastha stage the wife should not take care of her hair. Thus her hair
will become tangled in knots. Consequently the wife herself will no longer
be agitated by seximpulses. In this way both husband and wife can advance
in spiritual consciousness. This advanced stage is called the paramaharmsa
stage, and once it is obtained, both husband and wife can be actually liber-
ated from bodily consciousness. If the disciple remainssteady in the service
of the spiritual master, he need no longer fear falling down into the clutches
of maya.

the coldness of the feet and hands.

Being now alone and a widow in that forest, the daughter of Vidarbha

Figuratively the Queen is supposed to be the disciple of the King; thus
when the mortal body of the spiritual master expires, his disciples should
cry exactly as the Queen cries when the King leaves his body. However, the
disciple and spiritual master are never separated because the spiritual
master always keeps company with the disciple as long as the disciple
follows strictly the instructions of the spiritual master. This is called the
association of vani (words). Physical presence is called vapul. As long as the
spiritual master is physically present, the disciple should serve the physical
body of the spiritual master, and when the spiritual master is no longer
physically existing, the disciple should serve the instructions of the spiritual
master.

PURPORT

Whenever an d@carya comes, following the superior orders of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead or His representative, he establishes the principles
of religion, as enunciated in Bhagavad-gita. Religion means abiding by the
orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Religious principles begin
from the time one surrenders to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is
the acarya’s duty to spread a bona fide religious system and induce every-
one to bow down before the Supreme Lord. One executes the religious
principles by rendering devotional service, specifically the nine items like
hearing, chanting and remembering. Unfortunately, when the dacarya
disappears, rogues and nondevotees take advantage and immediately begin
to introduce unauthorized principles in the name of so-called svamis, yogis,
philanthropists, welfare workers and so on. Actually human life is meant
for executing the orders of the Supreme Lord, and this is stated in Bhagavad-
gita:

man-mand bhava mad-bhakto
mad-ydji mam namaskuru
mam evaisyasi yuktvaivam
atmanam mat-parayanah
“Engage your mind always in thinking of Me and become My devotee.
Offer obeisances and worship Me. Being completely absorbed in Me, surely
you will come to Me.” (Bg. 9.34)

The main business of human society is to think of the Supreme Person-
ality of Godhead at all times, to become His devotees, to worship the
Supreme Lord and to bow down before Him. The acarya, the authorized
representative of the Supreme Lord, establishes these principles, but when
he disappears, things once again become disordered. The perfect disciples
of the dcarya try to relieve the situation by sincerely following the
instructions of the spiritual master. At the present moment practically the
entire world is afraid of rogues and nondevotees; therefore this Krsna

TRANSLATION

She then prepared a blazing fire with firewood and placed the dead
body of her husband upon it. When this was finished, she lamented
severely and prepared herself to perish in the fire with her husband.

PURPORT

It is the long-standing tradition of the Vedic system that a faithful wife
dies along with her husband. This is called saha-marana. In India this system
was prevalent even to the date of British occupation. At that time, however,
awife who did not wish to die with her husband was sometimes forced to do
so by her relatives. Formerly that was not the case. The wife used to enter the
fire voluntarily. The British government stopped this practice, considering
it inhuman. However, from the early history of India we find that when
Maharaja Pandu died, he was survived by two wives—Madri and Kunti. The
question was whether both should die or one should die. After the death
of Maharaja Pandu, his wives settled that one should remain and the other
should go. Madri would perish with her husband in the fire, and Kunti
would remain to take charge of the five Pandava children. Even as late as
1936 we saw a devoted wife voluntarily enter the fire of her husband.

This indicates that a devotee’s wife must be prepared to act in such a
way. Similarly, a devoted disciple of the spiritual master would rather die
with the spiritual master than fail to execute the spiritual master’s mission.
As the Supreme Personality of Godhead comes down upon this earth to
reestablish the principles of religion, so his representative, the spiritual
master, also comes to reestablish religious principles. It is the duty of the
disciples to take charge of the mission of the spiritual master and execute
it properly. Otherwise the disciple should decide to die along with the
spiritual master. In other words, to execute the will of the spiritual master,
the disciple should be prepared to lay down his life and abandon all
personal considerations.

TRANSLATION

My dear King, one brihmana, who was an old friend of King एषा भभा)

came to that place and began to pacify the Queen with sweet words.
PURPORT

The appearance of an old friend in the form of a brahmana is| very
significant. In His Paramatma feature, Krsna is the old friend of everjone.
According to Vedic injunction, Krsna is sitting with the living entity sifle by
side. According to the $ruti-mantra (कण्ठ suparna sayuja sakhaya),the|Lord
is sitting within the heart of every living entity as suhrt, the best कलात्‌.
The Lord is always eager to have the living entity come home, bafk to
Godhead. Sitting with the living entity as witness, the Lord gives him all
chances to enjoy himself materially, but whenever there is an opportynity,
the Lord gives good counsel and advises the living entity to abahdon
trying to become happy through material adjustment and instead] turn
his face toward the Supreme Personality of Godhead and surr¢nder
unto Him. When one becomes serious to follow the mission of the spifitual
master, his resolution is tantamount to seeing the Supreme Personaljty of
Godhead. As explained before, this means meeting the Supreme Persogality
of Godhead in the instruction of the spiritual master. This is technjcally
called vani-sevd. Srila Visvanatha Cakravart Thakurastates in his Bhagvad-
gita commentary on the verse vyavas@yatmika buddhir ekeha kuru-narjdana
(Bg. 2.41) that one should serve the words of the spiritual master] The
disciple must stick to whatever the spiritual master orders. Simply by
following on that line, one sees the Supreme Personality of Godhead

The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Paramatma, appeared ১০০1০ the
Queen as a brahmana, but why didn’t He appear in His original form ps Sri
Krsna? Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura remarks that unless one 1ধ very
highly elevated in loving the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one cgnnot


--- Page 212 ---
1346 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 28
see Him as He is. Nonetheless, if one sticks to the principles enunciated by
the spiritual master, somehow or other he is in association with the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Since the Lord is in the heart, He can
advise a sincere disciple from within. Thisis also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita:
tesam satata-yuktanam
bhajatam priti-parvakam
dadami buddhi-yogam tam
yena mam upayanti te
“To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give
the understanding by which they can come to Me.” (Bg. 10.10)

In conclusion, if a disciple is very serious to execute the mission of the
spiritual master, he immediately associates with the Supreme Personality
of Godhead by vani or vapuh. This is the only secret of success in seeing
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Instead of being eager to see the
Lord insome bush of Vrndavana while at the same time engaging in sense
gratification, if one instead sticks to the principle of following the words of
the spiritual master, he will see the Supreme Lord without difficulty.
Srila Bilvamarigala Thakura has therefore said:

bhaktis tvayi sthiratara bhagavan yadi syad
daivena nah phalati divya-kisore-mirtih
muktih 50007 mukulitaiijali sevate ’sman
dharmartha-kama-gatayah samaya-pratiksih
“If I am engaged in devotional service unto You, my dear Lord, thenvery
easily can I perceive Your presence everywhere. And as far as liberation
is concerned, I think that liberation stands at my door with folded hands,
waiting to serve me—and all material conveniences of dharma [religiosity],
artha [economic development] and kama [sense gratification] stand with
her.” (Krsna-karpamrta 107) If one is very highly advanced in devotional
service, he will have no difficulty in seeing the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. If one engages in the service of the spiritual master, he not only
sees the Supreme Personality of Godhead but attains liberation. As far as
material conveniences are concerned, they automatically come, just as the
maidservants of a queen follow the queen wherever she goes. Liberation
is no problem for the pure devotee, and all material conveniences are
simply awaiting him at all stages of life.

PURPORT
When a person’s relative dies, renunciation is automatically visible.
Consultation with the Supersoul seated within everyone’s heart is possible
only when one is completely free from the contamination of material attach-
ment. One who is sincere and pure gets an opportunity to consult with the
Supreme Personality of Godhead in His Paramatma feature sitting within
everyone's heart. The Paramatma is always the caitya-guru, the spiritual
master within, and He comes before one externally as the instructor and
initiator spiritual master. The Lord can reside within the heart, and He can
also come out before a person and give him instructions. Thus the spiritual
master is not different from the Supersoul sitting within the heart. An un-
contaminated soul or living entity can get a chance to meet the Paramatma
face to face. Just as one gets a chance to consult with the Paramatma within
his heart, he also gets a chance to see Him actually situated before him.


--- Page 214 ---
1348 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 28
Then one can take instructions from the Supersoul directly. This is the
duty of the pure devotee: to see the bona fide spiritual master and consult
with the Supersoul within the heart.

When the brahmana asked the woman who the man lying on the floor
was, she answered that he was her spiritual master and that she was per-
plexed about what to do in his absence. At such a time the Supersoul
immediately appears, provided the devotee is purified in heart by following
the directions of the spiritual master. A sincere devotee who follows the
instructions of the spiritual master certainly gets direct instructions from
his heart from the Supersoul. Thus a sincere devotee is always helped
directly or indirectly by the spiritual master and the Supersoul. This is
confirmed in Caitanya-caritamrta: guru-krsna-prasade paya bhakti-lata-
bija. If the devotee serves his spiritual master sincerely, Krsna automatically
becomes pleased. Yasya prasidid bhagavad-prasadah. By satisfying the
spiritual master, one automatically satisfies Krsna. Thus the devotee
becomes enriched by both the spiritual master and Krsna. The Supersoul
is eternally the friend of the living entity and always remains with him.
The Supersoul has always been ready to help the living entity, even before
the creation of this material world. It is therefore stated here: yendgre
vicacartha. The word agre means “before the creation.” Thus the Super-
soul has been accompanying the living entity since before the creation.

very intimate friend? Unfortunately, you gave up My company and accepted
a position as enjoyer of this material world.
PURPORT
As stated in Bhagavad-gita:
iccha-dvesa-samutthena
dvandva-mohena bharata
sarva-bhitani sarnmoham
sarge yanti parantapa

© scion of Bharata [ Arjuna], 0 conquerer of the foe, all living entities are
born into delusion, overcome by the dualities of desire and hate.” (Bg. 7.27)

This is an explanation of how the living entity falls down into this ma-
terial world. In the spiritual world there is no duality, nor is there hate. The
Supreme Personality of Godhead expands Himself into many. In order to
enjoy bliss more and more, the Supreme Lord expands Himself in different
categories. As mentioned in the Varaha Purina, He expands Himself in
visnu-tattva (the svamsa expansion) and in His marginal potency (the
vibhinndmsa, or the living entity). These expanded living entities are
innumerable, just as the minute molecules of sunshine are innumerable
expansions of the sun. The vibhinnamsa expansions, the marginal potencies
of the Lord, are the living entities. When the living entities desire to enjoy
themselves, they develop a consciousness of duality and come to hate the
service of the Lord. In this way the living entities fall into the material
world. In the Prema-vivarta it is said:

krsna-bahirmukha haiia bhoga-vainica kare
nikata-stha mayd tare japatiya dhare

The natural position of the living entity is to serve the Lord in a transcen-
dental loving attitude. When the living entity wants to become Krsna
Himself or imitate Krsna, he falls down into the material world. Since
Krsna is the Supreme Father, His affection for the living entity is eternal.
When the living entity falls down into the material world, the Supreme
Lord, through His svamsa expansion (Paramatma), keeps company with the
living entity. In this way the living entity may some day return home, back
to Godhead.

By misusing his independence, the living entity falls down from the
service of the Lord and takes a position in this material world as an enjoyer.
That is to say, the living entity takes his position within a material body.


--- Page 216 ---
1350 Stimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 28
Wanting to take a very exalted position, the living entity instead becomes
entangled in a repetition of birth and death. He selects his position as a
human being, a demigod, a cat, a dog, a tree, etc. In this way the living
entity selects a body out of the 8,400,000 forms and tries to satisfy himself
by a variety of material enjoyment. The Supersoul, however, does not like
him to do this. Consequently the Supersoul instructs him to surrender unto
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord then takes charge of the
living entity. But unless the living entity is uncontaminated by material
desires, he cannot surrender to the Supreme Lord. In Bhagavad-gita the
Lord says:
bhoktaram yajiia-tapasam
sarva-loka-mahesvaram
suhrdari sarva-bhitanam
[कए mam santim rcchati
“The sages, knowing Me as the ultimate purpose of all sacrifices and austeri-
ties, the Supreme Lord of all planets and demigods and the benefactor and
well-wisher of all living entities, attain peace from the pangs of material
miseries.” (Bg. 5.29)

The Supreme Lord is the supreme friend of everyone; however, no one
can take advantage of the supreme friend’s instructions while making his
own plans to become happy and entangling himself in the modes of ma-
terial nature. When there is creation, the living entities take on different
forms according to past desires. This means that all the species or forms of
life are simultaneously created. Darwin’s theory stating that no human
being existed from the beginning but that humans evolved after many,
many years is simply a nonsensical theory. From Vedic literature we find
that the first creature within the universe is Lord Brahma. Being the most
intelligent personality, Lord Brahma could take charge of creating all the
variety found within this material world.

TRANSLATION

My dear gentle friend, both you and I are exactly like two swans. We live
together in the same heart, which is just like the Manasa lake. Although we
have been living together for many thousands of years, we are still far away
from our original home.

PURPORT

The original home of the living entity and the Supreme Personality of
Godhead is the spiritual world. In the spiritual world both the Lord and the
living entities live together very peacefully. Since the living entity remains
engaged in the service of the Lord, they both share a blissful life in the
spiritual world. However, when the living entity wants to enjoy himself, he
falls down into the material world. Even while he is in that position, the
Lord remains with him as the Supersoul, his intimate friend. Because of his
forgetfulness, the living entity does not know that the Supreme Lord is
accompanying him as the Supersoul. In this way the living entity remains
conditioned in each and every millennium. Although the Lord follows him
as a friend, the living entity, because of forgetful material existence, does
not recognize Him.

TRANSLATION

My dear friend, you are now My very same friend. Since you left Me,
You have become more and more materialistic, and, not seeing Me, you have
been traveling in different forms throughout this material world, which was
created by some woman.

PURPORT

When the living entity falls down, he goes into the material world, which
was created by the external energy of the Lord. This external energy is
described herein as “some woman,” or prakrti. This material world is com-
posed of material elements, ingredients supplied by the mahat-tattva, the
total material energy. The material world, created by this external energy,
becomes the so-called home of the conditioned soul. Within this material
world the conditioned soul accepts different apartments or different bodily
forms and then travels about. Sometimes he travels in the higher planetary
systems and sometimes in the lower systems. Sometimes he travels in
higher species of life and sometimes in lower species. He has been wan-
dering within this material universe since time immemorial. As explained
by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu:

brahmanda bhramite kona bhagyavan jiva
guru-krsna-prasade paya bhakti-lata-bija
(Cc. Madhya 19.151)
The living entity wanders into many species of life, but he is fortunate
when he once again meets his friend, either in person or through His
representative.

Actually, it is Krsna who personally advises all living entities to return
home, back to Godhead. Sometimes Krsna sends His representative, who,
delivering Krsna’s very message, canvasses all living entities to return home,
back to Godhead. Unfortunately the living entity is so greatly attached to
material enjoyment that he does not take the instructions of Krsna or His
representative very seriously. This material tendency is mentioned in this
verse as gramya-matih (sense gratification). The word mahim means “within
this material world.” All living entities within this material world are
sensually inclined. Consequently they become entangled in different types
of bodies and suffer the pangs of material existence.

to gates in the walls of the city. The principal ingredients are earth, water

intelligence (buddhi).

TRANSLATION

The five stores are the five working sensory organs. They transact their
business through the combined forces of the five elements, which are
eternal. Behind all this activity is the soul. The soul is a person and an
enjoyer in reality. However, because he is now hidden within the city of
the body, he is devoid of knowledge.

PURPORT

The living entity enters the material creation with the aid of the five
elements—earth, water, fire, air and ether—and thus his body is formed.
Although the living entity is working from within, he is nonetheless
unknown. The living entity enters the material creation, but because he is
bewildered by the material energy, he appears to be hidden. The bodily
conception of life is prominent because of ignorance (navabudhyate).
Intelligence is described in the feminine gender, but owing to her promi-
nence in all activities, she is described in this verse as adhisah, the controller.
The living entity lives by means of fire, water and foodgrain. It is through
the combination of these three that the body is maintained. Consequently
the body is called prakrti, material creation. All the elements gradually


--- Page 221 ---
Text 59] Puranijana Becomes a Woman in the Next Life 1355
combine to form flesh, bone, blood and so on. All these appear as various
apartments. It is said in the Vedas that the digested foods are ultimately
divided into three. The solid portion becomes stool, and the semi-liquid
portion turns into flesh. The liquid portion turns yellow and is again divided
into three. One of these liquid portions is called urine. Similarly, the fiery
portion is divided into three, and one is called bone. Out of the five ele-
ments, fire, water and foodgrains are very important. These three are
mentioned in the previous verse, whereas sky (ether) and air are not
mentioned. This is all explained in Bhagavad-gita:
prakrtim purusam caiva
viddhy anadi ubhav api
vikarams ca gunams caiva
viddhi prakrti-sambhavan
“Material nature and the living entities should be understood to be begin-
ningless. Their transformations and the modes of matter are products of
material nature.” (Bg. 13.20)

Prakrti, material nature, and purusa, the living entity, are eternal. When
they both come in contact, there are different reactions and manifestations.
All of them should be considered the results of the interaction of the three
modes of material nature.

My dear friend, when you enter such a body along with the woman of
material desires, you become overly absorbed in sense enjoyment. Because
of this, you have forgotten your spiritual life. Due to your material con-
ceptions, you are placed in various miserable conditions.

PURPORT

When a person becomes materially engrossed, he has no capacity to hear
about spiritual existence. Forgetfulness of spiritual existence entangles a
man more and more 111 material existence. Such is the result of sinful life.
Various bodies are developed with the material ingredients because of
different types of sinful activities. King Purarijana assumed the body of a
woman, Vaidarbhi, as a result of his sinful activities. Bhagavad-gita clearly
says (striyo vaiSyds tatha Siidrah) that such a body is lowborn. If one takes
shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, he can be
elevated to the highest perfection, even though he be lowborn. One acquires
lower births when one’s spiritual intelligence is reduced.

Text 60 1] Puraiijana Becomes a Woman in the Next Life 1357
PURPORT

In the material world many living entities come into contact with one
another, and, increasing their attachment to a particular type of body,
become related as father, husband, mother, wife, etc. Actually every living
entity is a separate individual being, and it is because of his contact with
matter that he comes together with other bodies and becomes falsely
related. False bodies create various associations in the name of family,
community, society and nationality. Actually every living entity is part
and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the living entities
are overly engrossed in the material body. The Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Krsna, appears and gives instructions in the form of Bhagavad-
gita and Vedic literatures. The Supreme Lord gives these instructions
because He is the eternal friend of the living entities. His instructions are
important because by them the living entity can obtain liberation from
bodily engagement. As water passes down a river, many straws and grasses
are carried from the shore. These straws and grasses come together in the
river’s current, but when the waves toss this way and that, they are
separated and carried somewhere else. Similarly, the innumerable living
entities within this material world are being carried by the waves of
material nature. Sometimes the waves bring them together, and they form
friendships and relate to one another on a bodily basis of family, com-
munity or nationality. Eventually they are thrown out of association by
the waves of material nature. This process has been going on since the
creation of material nature. In this regard, Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura
sings,

(miche) mayara vase, ydccha bhese’,
khaccha habudubu, bhai
(jiva) krsna-dasa, e visvasa,
karle ta’ ara duhkha nai
“My dear living entities, you are being carried away by the waves of
material nature. Sometimes you are on the surface, sometimes you are
being drowned. In this way your eternal life is being spoiled. If you simply
catch hold of Krsna and take shelter of His lotus feet, you will once again
get free from all the miserable material conditions.”

In this verse the words suhrt (well-wisher) and tava (your) are very
significant. One’s so-called husband, relative, son, father, or whatever can
not actually be a well-wisher. The only actual well-wisher is Krsna Himself,
as Krsna confirms in Bhagavad-gita: suhrdam sarva-bhiitanam (Bg. 5.29).


--- Page 224 ---
1358 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 28
Society, friendship, love and well-wishers are all simply results of being
packed in different bodies. One should know this well and try to get out
of this bodily encagement into which one is thrown birth after birth. One
should take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, and
return home, back to Godhead.

actually both of us—you and I—are pure spiritual identities. Now just try
to understand this. I am trying to explain our factual position.
PURPORT
The factual position of both the Supreme Personality of Godhead and
the living entity is qualitatively one. The Supreme Lord is the Supreme
Spirit, the Supersoul, and the living entity is the individual spiritual soul.
Even though both of them are original spiritual identities, the living entity
forgets his identity when he comes in contact with material nature and
becomes conditioned. At such a time he identifies himself as a product of
the material nature. Because of the material body, he forgets that he is the
eternal (sandtana) part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Text 62] Puraiijana Becomes a Woman in the Next Life 1359
This is confirmed in this way: mamaivamso jiva-loke jiva-bhiitah sandtanah.
The word sandtana is found in several places in Bhagavad-gita. Both the
Lord and the living entity are sanatana (eternal), and there is also a place
known as sandtana beyond this material nature. The real residence of both
the living entity and God is the domain of sandtana, not this material
world. The material world is the temporary external energy of the Lord,
and the living entity is placed in this material world because he wanted to
imitate the position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this
material world he tries to enjoy his senses to his best capacity. All the
activities of the conditioned soul within this material world are perpetually
taking place in different types of bodies, but when the living entity acquires
developed consciousness, he should try to rectify his situation and again
become a member of the spiritual world. The process by which one can
return home, back to Godhead, is bhakti-yoga, sometimes called sanatana-
dharma. Instead of accepting a temporary occupational duty based on the
material body, one should take to the process of sandtana-dharma, or
bhakti-yoga, so that he can put an end to this perpetual bondage in
material bodies and once again return home, back to Godhead. As long as
human society works on the basis of false material identification, all the
so-called advancements of science and philosophy are simply useless. They
only serve to mislead human society. Andhd yathandhair upaniyamandh.
In the material world, the blind simply lead the blind.

TRANSLATION
My dear friend, I, the Supersoul, and you, the individual soul, are not
different in quality, for we are both spiritual. In fact, My dear friend,
you are qualitatively not different from Me in your constitutional
position. Just try to consider this subject. Those who are actually advanced
scholars, who are in knowledge, do not find any qualitative difference
between you and Me.
PURPORT
Both the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the living entity
are qualitatively one. There is no factual difference between the two.
The Mayavadi philosophers are again and again defeated by the illusory
energy because they think that there is no separation between the Super-
soul and the individual soul or that there is no Supersoul. They are also
misled in thinking that everything is the Supersoul. However, those who
are kavayah, learned scholars, actually know the facts. They do not commit
such mistakes. They know that God and the individual soul are one in
quality, but that the individual soul falls under the clutches of maya,
whereas the Supersoul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the con-
troller of maya. Maya is the creation of the Supreme Lord (mayd srsta);
therefore the Supreme Lord is the controller of maya. Although one in
quality with the Supreme Lord, the individual soul is under the control
of maya. Mayavadi philosophers cannot distinguish between the controller
and the controlled.

Text 63] Puranijana Becomes a Woman in the Next Life 1361
TRANSLATION

As a person sees the reflection of his body in a mirror to be one with
himself and not different, whereas others actually see two bodies, so in
our material condition, in which the living being is affected and yet not
affected, there is a difference between God and the living entity.

PURPORT

Being affected by the conditioning of matter, Mayavadi philosophers
cannot see the difference between the Supreme Lord and the living entity.
When the sun is reflected in a pot of water, the sun knows that there is no
difference between him and the reflected sun in the water. Those in
ignorance, however, perceive that there are many small suns reflected in
each and every pot. As far as the brilliance is concerned, there is brilliance
both in the original sun and in the reflections, but the reflections are small,
whereas the original sun is very large. Vaignava philosophers conclude that
the living entity is simply a small sample of the original Supreme Personality
of Godhead. Qualitatively, God and the living entities are one, but quanti-
tatively the living entities are small fragments of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. The Supreme Lord is full, powerful and opulent. In the
previous verse, the Lord says, “My dear friend, you and I are not different.”
This nondifference refers to qualitative oneness, for it was not necessary
for the Paramatma, the Supreme Personality, to remind the conditioned
soul that he is not one in quantity. The self-realized soul never thinks
that he and the Supreme Personality of Godhead are one in every respect.
Although he and the Supreme Personality of Godhead are one in quality,
the living entity is prone to forget his spiritual identity, whereas the
Supreme Personality never forgets. This is the difference between lipta
and alipta. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is eternally alipta, uncon-
taminated by the external energy. The conditioned soul, however, being
in contact with material nature, forgets his real identity; therefore when
he sees himself in the conditioned state, he identifies himself with the
body. For the Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, there is no
difference between the body and the soul. He is completely soul; He has
no material body. Although the Supersoul,Paramatma, and the individual
soul are both within the body, the Supersoul is devoid of designation,
whereas the conditioned soul is designated by his particular type of body.
The Supersoul is called antaryami, and He is extensive. This is confirmed
in Bhagavad-gita:


--- Page 228 ---
1362 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 28
ksetrajiiam capi mam viddhi
sarva-ksetresu bharata
ksetra-ksetrajiiayor jianam
yat taj jianam matam mama
“@ scion of Bharata, you should understand that I am also the knower in
all bodies, and to understand this body and its owner is called knowledge.
That is My opinion.” (Bg. 13.3)

The Supersoul is present in everyone’s body, whereas the individual soul
is conditioned in one particular type of body. The individual soul cannot
understand what is taking place in another’s body, but the Supersoul
knows very well what is happening in all bodies. In other words, the
Supersoul is always present in His full spiritual position, whereas the
individual soul is prone to forget himself. Nor is the individual soul
present everywhere. Generally in his conditioned state the individual soul
cannot understand his relationship with the Supersoul, but sometimes,
when he is free from all conditional existence, he can see the real difference
between the Supersoul and himself. When the Supersoul tells the con-
ditioned soul, “You and I are one and the same,” it is to remind the con-
ditioned soul of his spiritual identity as being qualitatively one. In the
Third Canto of Srimad-Bhdagavatam, it is said:

yatholmukad visphulingad
dhamad vapi sva-sambhavat
apy dtmatvendbhimatad
yathagnih prthag ulmukat
(Bhag. 3.28.40)
Fire has different features. There is flame, the sparks and the smoke.
Although these are one in quality, there is still a difference between the
fire, the flame, the spark and the smoke. The living entity becomes
conditioned, but the Supreme Personality of Godhead is different because
He does not become conditioned at any point. In the Fedas it is stated:
atmd tathd prthag drastd bhagavan brahma-samjiitah. Atmais the individual
soul as well as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the seer of
everything. Although both are spirit, still there is always a difference.
In the smprti it is also said: yathagneh ksudra visphulinga vyuccaranti.
Just as sparks manifest in a large fire, similarly the small individual souls
are present in the big spiritual flame. In Bhagavad-gita Lord Krsna says:


--- Page 229 ---
Text 64] Purafijana Becomes a Woman in the Next Life 1363
mayd tatam idani sarvam
Jagad avyakta-murtina
mat-sthani sarva-bhiitani
na caham tesv avasthitah
“By Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded. All
beings are in Me, but I am not in them.” (Bg. 9.4)

Although all living entities are resting in Him, as small fiery sparks
rest on a large flame, both are differently situated. Similarly, in the Visnu
Purana it is said:

eka-desa-sthitasyagner
Jyotsna vistarini yatha
parasya brahmanah Saktis
tathedam akhilam jagat
“Fire is situated in one place, but it distributes heat and light. Similarly,
the Supreme Personality of Godhead is distributing His energies in different
ways.” The living entity is but one of these energies (marginal energy). The
energy and the energetic are one in one sense, but they are differently
situated as energy and the energetic. Similarly, the sac-cid-ananda form
confirmed in Brahma-samhita (i$varah paramah krsnah sac-cid-anande
vigrahah) is different from that of the living entity in both his conditioned
and liberated states. Only atheists consider the living entity and the Person-
ality of Godhead equal in all respects. Caitanya Mahaprabhu therefore says,
mayavadi-bhasya Sunile haya sarva-nasa. “If one follows the instructions of
Mayavadi philosophers and believes that the Supreme Personality of God-
head and the individual soul are one, his understanding of real philosophy is
forever doomed.”

TRANSLATION
In this way both swans live together in the heart. When the one swan is
instructed by the other, he is situated in his constitutional position. This
means he regains his original Krsna consciousness, which was lost because
of his material attraction.
PURPORT
Here it is clearly stated: hamso hamsena pratibodhitah. The individual
soul and the Supersoul are both compared to swans (hamsa) because they
are white or uncontaminated. One swan, however, is superior and is the
instructor of the other. When the inferior swan is separated from the other
swan, he is attracted to material enjoyment. This is the cause of his fall-
down. When he hears the instructions of the other swan, he understands his
real position and is again revived to his original consciousness. The Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Krsna, comes down (avatara) to deliver His devo-
tees and kill the demons. He also gives His sublime instructions in the form
of Bhagavad-gita. The individual soul has to understand his position by the
grace of the Lord and the spiritual master because the text of Bhagavad-
gita cannot be understood simply by academic qualifications. One has to
learn Bhagavad-gita from a realized soul.
tad viddhi pranipatena
pariprasnena sevaya

“Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from
him submissively and render service unto him. The self-realized soul can
impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth.” (Bg. 4.34)
Thus one has to select a bona fide spiritual master and become en-
lightened to his original consciousness. In this way the individual soul can
understand that he is always subordinate to the Supersoul. As soon as he
declines to remain subordinate and tries to become an enjoyer, he begins


--- Page 231 ---
Text 65] Puranjana Becomes ও Woman in the Next Life 1365
his material conditioning. When he abandons this spirit of being an indi-
vidual owner or enjoyer, he becomes situated in his liberated state. The word
sva-sthah, meaning ‘‘situated in one’s original position,” is very significant
in this verse. When one gives up his unwanted attitude of superiority, he
becomes situated in his original position. The word tad-vyabhicarena is also
significant, for it indicates that when one is separated from God due to
disobedience, his real sense is lost. Again, by the grace of Krsna and guru,
he can be properly situated in hisliberated position. These verses are spoken
by Srila Narada Muni, and his purpose in speaking them is to revive our
consciousness. Although the living entity and the Supersoul are one in
quality, the individual soul has to pursue the instruction of the Supersoul.
That is the state of liberation.

TRANSLATION

My dear King Pracinabarhi, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the
cause of all causes, is celebrated to be known indirectly. Thus I have
described the story of Puraiijana to you. Actually it is an instruction for
self-realization.

PURPORT

There are many similar stories in the Puranas for self-realization. As
stated in the Vedas: paroksa-priya iva hi devah. There are many stories in
the Puranas that are intended to interest ordinary men in transcendental
subjects, but actually these refer to real facts. They are not to be considered


--- Page 232 ---
1366 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 28
stories without a transcendental purpose. Some of them refer to real
historical facts. One should be interested, however, in the real purport of
the story. Indirect instruction is quickly understandable for a common
man. Factually the path of bhakti-yoga is the path of hearing directly

about the pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (87৫00712077

kirtanarm visnoh), but those who are not interested in hearing directly

about the activities of the Lord, or who cannot understand them, can very
effectively hear such stories and fables like this one narrated by Narada

Muni.

The following is a glossary of some of the important words in this chapter.

Adesakari. The actions resulting from sinful activities.

Agastya. The mind.

Amatya. The governor of the senses, the mind.

Arbuda-arbuda. Various types of $ravana and kirtana of the Supreme
Lord’s name, quality, form and so on.

Ari. Impediments like disease.

Bhoga. Enjoyment. Herein this word refers to real enjoyment in spiritual
life.

Bhrtya. The servants of the body, namely the senses.

Dravida-raja. Devotional service or a person eligible to act in devotional
service.

Dvara. The doors of the body, such as the eyes and ears.

Grha. Home. For spiritual cultivation one requires an undisturbed place
or the good association of devotees.

Idhmavaha. The devotee who approaches the spiritual master. Idhma
refers to wood that is taken to burn as fuel for a fire. A brahmacari
is supposed to take this idhma to ignite the fire used in performing
sacrifices. By spiritual instruction a brahmacari is trained to ignite a fire
and offer oblations in the morning. He is supposed to go to the spiritual
master to take lessons on transcendental subject matter, and the Vedic
injunction is that when approaching the spiritual master one must carry


--- Page 233 ---
Purarijana Becomes a Woman in the Next Life 1367
with him fuel to perform yajiias, or sacrifices. The exact Vedic injunction
is as follows:

tad-vijianarthar sa gurum evabhigacchet

samit-panih Srotriyari brahma-nistham
“To learn transcendental subject matter, one must approach the spiritual
master. In doing so, he should carry fuel to burn in sacrifice. The symptom
of such a spiritual master is that he is expert in understanding the Vedic
conclusion and therefore he constantly engages in the service of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead.” (Mundaka Upanisad 1.2.12) By
serving such a bona fide spiritual master, gradually a conditioned soul
becomes detached from material enjoyment and invariably makes prog-
ress in spiritual realization under the direction of the spiritual master.
Those who are misled by the illusory energy are never interested in ap-
proaching a spiritual master to make life successful.

Jaya. Intelligence.

Jirna-sarpa. The fatigued air of life.

Kalakanya. The invalidity of old age.

Kama. A high fever.

Kulacala. The place where there is no disturbance.

Kutumbini. Intelligence.

Madireksana. Madireksana refers to one whose eyes are so attractive that
one who observes them becomes maddened by her. In other words,
madireksana means a very beautiful young girl. According to Jiva
Gosvami, madireksana means the personified deity of bhakti. If one is at-
tracted by the bhakti cult, he becomes engaged in the service of the
Lord and the spiritual master, and thus his life becomes successful.
Vaidarbhi, the woman, became a follower of her husband. As she left
her comfortable home for the service of her husband, so a serious student
of spiritual understanding must give up everything for the service of the
spiritual master. As stated by Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura, yasya
prasadad bhagavat-prasadah: if one wants actual success in life, he must
strictly follow the instructions of the spiritual master. By following such
instructions, one is sure to make rapid progress in spiritual life. This
statement by Visvanatha Cakravarti is in pursuance of the following
injunction from the Svetasvatara Upanisad:


--- Page 234 ---
1368 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 28
yasya deve para bhaktir
yatha deve tatha gurau
tasyaite kathita hy arthah
prakasante mahatmanah
“Only unto those great souls who have implicit faith in both the Lord
and the spiritual master are all the imports of Vedic knowledge auto-
matically revealed.” (Svet. Up. 6.23) In the Chandogya Upanisad it is
said, dcaryavan puruso veda: “One who approaches a bona fide spiritual
master can understand everything about spiritual realization.”

Malayadhvaja. A nice devotee who is like sandalwood.

207८210. The five sense objects.

Paricchada. The total aggregate of the senses. 9

Paura-jana. The seven elements that constitute the body.

Pautra. Patience and gravity.

Prajvara. A kind of fever called visnpu-jvdra.

Pratikriya. Counteracting agents such as mantras and medicines.

Pura-palaka. The life air.

Putra. Consciousness.

Sainika. The condition of threefold miseries.

Sapta-suta. The seven sons, namely hearing, chanting, remembering, of-
fering prayers, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, worshiping the Deity,
and becoming a servant of the Lord.

Sauhrdya. Endeavor.

Suta. The son of Vaidarbhi, or, in other words, one who is somewhat
advanced in fruitive activities and who comes in contact with a devotee
spiritual master. Such a person becomes interested in the subject matter
of devotional service.

Vaidarbhi. The woman who was formerly a man but took birth as a woman
in his next life because of too much attachment to woman. Darbha
means ८50 grass. In fruitive activities, or karma-kandiya cere-
monies, one requires kusa grass. Thus vaidarbhi refers to one who
takes birth in a family of karma-kandiya understanding. However, if by
karma-kanda activities one by chance comes in contact with a devotee,
as Vaidarbhi did when she married Malayadhvaja, his life becomes suc-
cessful. He then pursues the devotional service of the Lord. The con-


--- Page 235 ---
Puraiijana Becomes a Woman in the Next Life 1369
ditioned soul becomes liberated simply by following the instructions
of the bona fide spiritual master.

Vidarbha-rajasimha. The best of persons who are expert in fruitive
activities.
Virya. One who has mercy.
Yavana. The servant of Yamaraja.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fourth Canto, Twenty-
eighth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “Puraiijana Becomes
a Woman in the Next Life.”

those who are perfect in spiritual knowledge can understand, but for us,

your story is very difficult.

In Bhagavad-gita Lord Krsna says:

“Deluded by the three modes [goodness, passion and ignorance], the
whole world does not know Me, who am above the modes and inexhaust-
ible.” (Bg. 7.13)

Generally people are enchanted by the three modes of material nature
and therefore practically unable to understand that behind all material-
istic activities in the cosmic manifestation is the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Krsna. Generally when people are engaged in sinful or pious
activities, they are not perfect in knowledge of devotional service. The
allegorical story narrated by Narada Muni to King Barhisman is especially
meant to engage conditioned souls in devotional service. The entire
story, narrated allegorically, is easily understood by a person in devotional
service, but those who are engaged not in devotional service but in sense
gratification cannot perfectly understand it. That is admitted by King
Barhigsman.

This Twenty-ninth Chapter describes that by too much attachment for
women one becomes a woman in the next life, but a person who associates
with the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His representative becomes
free from all material attachments and is thus liberated.

TRANSLATION
The great sage Narada Muni continued: You must understand that
Puranjana, the living entity, transmigrates according to his own work into
different types of bodies, which may be one-legged, two-legged, three-
legged, four-legged, many-legged or simply legless. Transmigrating into
these various types of bodies, the living entity, as the so-called enjoyer, is
known as Puranjana.
PURPORT
How the spirit soul transmigrates from one type of body to another is
nicely described here. The word eka-pdda, one-legged, refers to ghosts,
for it is said that ghosts walk on one leg. The word dvi-pada, meaning
biped, refers to human beings. When he is old and invalid, the human
being is supposed to be a triped, or three-legged, because he walks with
the help of a stick or some kind of cane. Of course the word catus-pida
refers to quadrupeds or animals. The word bahu-pada refers to those
creatures who have more than four legs. There are many insects, such as
the centipede, and also many aquatic animals that have many legs. The
word apadaka, meaning without legs, refers to serpents. The name
Purarijana indicates one who enjoys possessing different types of bodies.
His mentality for enjoyment in the material world is accommodated by
different types of bodies.

TRANSLATION
The person I have described as unknown is the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, the master and eternal friend of the living entity. Since the


--- Page 239 ---
1374 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 29
living entities cannot realize the Supreme Personality of Godhead by
material names, activities or qualities, He remains everlastingly unknown
to the conditioned soul.

PURPORT

Because the Supreme Personality of Godhead is unknown to the con-
ditioned soul, He is sometimes described in Vedic literatures as nirakdra,
avijiidta, or avdnmanasa-gocara. Actually it is a fact that the Supreme
Personality of Godhead cannot be perceived by material senses as far as
His form, name, quality, pastimes or paraphernalia are concerned. However,
when one is spiritually advanced, one can understand the name, form,
qualities, pastimes and paraphernalia of the Supreme Lord. This is con-
firmed in Bhagavad-gita:

bhaktyda mam abhijanati
yavan ya$ casmi tattvatah
tato mam tattvato jiatva
visate tad-anantaram
“One can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional
service. And when one is in full consciousness of the Supreme Lord by
such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of God.” (Bg. 18.55)

One can understand in truth the Supreme Personality of Godhead only
when one is engaged in devotional service. Ordinary persons engaged in
pious and impious activities cannot understand the form, name and
activities of the Lord. The devotee, however, can know the Personality of
Godhead in many respects. He can understand that Krsna is the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, that His address is Goloka Vrndavana and that
His activities are all spiritual. Because the Lord’s form and activities
cannot be understood by materialistic people, He is described by the
$astras as nirdkdra, that is, one whose form cannot be ascertained by a
materialistic person. This does not mean that the Supreme Personality of
Godhead has no form; it means that it is not understood by the karmis or
fruitive actors. His form is described in Brahma-sarhita as sac-cid-ananda
vigraha. As confirmed by the Padma Purana:

atah §ri-krsna-namadi
na bhaved grahyam indriyaih
sevonmukhe hi jihvadau
svayam eva sphuraty adah


--- Page 240 ---
Text 4] Talks Between Narada and King Pracinabarhi 1375
“No one can understand Krsna as He is by utilizing the blunt material
senses. However, the Lord reveals Himself to His devotees, being pleased
with them because of their transcendental loving service rendered unto
Him.”

Since the name, form, qualities and activities of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead Krsna cannot be understood by the material senses, He is also
called adhoksaja, meaning beyond sense perception. When the senses are
purified by devotional activity, the devotee understands everything about
the Lord by the Lord’s grace. In this verse the words pumbhir namabhir
va kriyd-gupaih are especially significant because God, Krsna, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, has many names, activities and qualities, although
none of them are material. Despite the fact that all these names, activities
and pastimes are mentioned in the $astras and understood by the devotees,
the karmis (fruitive laborers) cannot understand them. Nor can the janis
(mental speculators) understand them. Although there are thousands of
names of Lord Visnu, the karmis and jiianis intermingle the names of the
Supreme Godhead with the names of demigods and human beings. Because
they cannot understand the actual name of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, they take for granted that any name can be accepted. They
believe that since the Absolute Truth is impersonal, they can call Him by
any name. Otherwise, they maintain, He has no name. This is not a fact.
Here it is clearly stated: namabhir va kriya-gunpaih. The Lord has specific
names such as Rama, Krsna, Govinda, Narayana, Vignu and Adhoksaja.
There are indeed many names, but the conditioned soul cannot understand
them.

1376 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 29
TRANSLATION

When the living entity wants to enjoy the modes of material nature in
their totality, he prefers, out of many bodily forms, to accept that body
which has nine gates, two hands and two legs. Thus he prefers to become
a human being or a demigod.

PURPORT

This is a very nice explanation of how the spiritual being, the part and
parcel of Krsna, God, accepts a material body by virtue of his own desires.
Accepting two hands, two legs, and so on, the living entity fully enjoys the
modes of material nature. Lord Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita:

iccha-dvesa samutthena
dvandva-mohena bharata
sarva-bhitani 50778771011 077
sarge yanti parantapa
“O scion of Bharata [Arjuna], 0 conquerer of the foe, all living entities
are born into delusion, overcome by the dualities of desire and hate.”
(Bg. 7.27)

Originally the living entity is a spiritual being, but when he actually
desires to enjoy this material world, he comes down. From this verse we
can understand that the living entity first accepts a body that is human in
form, but gradually, due to his degraded activities, he falls into lower
forms of life—into the animal, plant and aquatic forms. By the gradual
process of evolution, the living entity again attains the body of a human
being and is given another chance to get out of the process of transmigra-
tion. If he again misses his chance in the human form to understand his
position, he is again placed in the cycle of birth and death in various types
of bodies.

The desire of the living entity to come into the material world is not
very difficult to understand. Although one may be born in a family of
Aryans, where there are restrictions against meat-eating, intoxication,
gambling and illicit sex, still one may want to enjoy these forbidden
things. There is always someone who wants to go to a prostitute for
illicit sex or to a hotel to eat meat and drink wine. There is always someone
who wants to gamble at nightclubs or enjoy so-called sports. All these
propensities are already within the hearts of the living entities, but some
living entities stop to enjoy these abominable activities and consequently


--- Page 242 ---
Text 5] Talks Between Narada and King Pracinabarhi 1377
fall down to a degraded platform. The more one desires a degraded life
within his heart, the more he falls down to occupy different forms of
abominable existence. This is the process of transmigration and evolution.
A particular type of animal may have a strong tendency to enjoy one
kind of sense enjoyment, but in the human form one can enjoy all the
senses. The human form has the facility to utilize all the senses for
gratification. Unless one is properly trained, he becomes a victim of the
modes of material nature, as confirmed by Bhagavad-gita:
prakrteh kriyamanani
gunaih karmani sarvasah
ahankara-vimadhatma
kartaham iti manyate
“The bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of
material nature, thinks himself the doer of activities that are in actuality
carried out by nature.” (Bg. 3.27)

As soon as one desires to enjoy his senses, he puts himself under the
control of material energy and automatically or mechanically is placed
into the cycle of birth and death in various life forms.

TRANSLATION

The great sage Narada continued: The word pramada mentioned in this

regard refers to material intelligence, or ignorance. It is to be understood


--- Page 243 ---
1378 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 29
as such. When one takes shelter of this kind of intelligence, he identifies
himself with the material body. Influenced by the material consciousness
of “I” and “mine,” he begins to enjoy and suffer through his senses. Thus
the living entity is entrapped.

PURPORT

In material existence so-called intelligence is actually ignorance. When
intelligence is cleared up, it is called buddhi-yoga. In other words, when
intelligence is dovetailed with the desires of Krsna, it is called buddhi-yoga
or bhakti-yoga. Therefore in Bhagavad-gita Krsna says:

tesam satata-yuktanam
bhajatam priti-parvakam
dadami buddhi-yogam tam
yena mam upayanti te
“To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give
the understanding by which they can come to Me.” (Bg. 10.10)

Real intelligence means linking with the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. When this is done, the Supreme Personality of Godhead from
within gives one the real intelligence by which one can return home, back
to Godhead. Intelligence in the material world is described in this verse as
pramada because in material existence the living entity falsely claims things
to be his. He thinks, “I am the monarch of all I survey.” This is ignorance.
Actually nothing belongs to him. Even the body and the senses do not
belong to him, for they are given to him by the grace of the Lord to satisfy
his different propensities through the material energy. Nothing actually
belongs to theliving entity, but he becomes mad after everything, claiming,
“This is mine. This is mine. This is mine.” Janasya moho ‘yam aham
mameti. This is called illusion. Nothing belongs to the living entity, but he
claims that everything belongs to him. Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu
recommends that this false intelligence be purified (ceto-darpana-
marjanam). When the mirror of intelligence is polished, the real activities
of the living entity begin. This means that when a person comes to the
platform of Krsna consciousness, his real intelligence acts. At that time
he knows that everything belongs to Krsna and nothing belongs to him.
As long as one thinks that everything belongs to him, he is in material
consciousness, and when he knows perfectly that everything belongs to
Krsna, he is in Krsna consciousness.

TRANSLATION

The five working senses and the five senses that acquire knowledge are
all male friends of Puraiijani. The living entity is assisted by these senses
in acquiring knowledge and engaging in activity. The engagements of the
senses are known as girl friends, and the serpent, which was described as
having five heads, is the life air acting within the five circulatory processes.

PURPORT
krsna-bahirmukha hafia bhoga-vaiicha kare

(Prema-vivarta 6.2)

Because of his desire to enjoy the material world, the living entity is
dressed with the material gross and subtle bodies. Thus he is given a chance
to enjoy the senses. The senses are therefore the instruments for enjoying
the material world; consequently the senses have been described as friends.
Sometimes, because of too much sinful activity, the living entity does not
get a material gross body, but hovers on the subtle platform. This is called
ghostly life. Because of his not possessing a gross body, he creates a great
deal of trouble in his subtle body. Thus the presence of a ghost is horrible
for those who are living in the gross body. As stated in Bhagavad-gita:

utkramantarm sthitam vapi
bhufijanam va gunanvitam

“The foolish cannot understand how a living entity can quit his body, nor
can they understand what sort of body he enjoys under the spell of the
modes of nature. But one whose eyes are trained in knowledge can see all
this.” (Bg. 15.10)

The living entities are merged into the air of life, which acts in different
ways for circulation. There 15 prana, apana, udana, vyana, and samana, and
because thelife air functionsin this fivefold way, it is compared to the five-
hooded serpent. The soul passes through the kupdalini-cakra like a serpent
crawling on the ground. The life air is compared to urega, the serpent.
Paiica-vrtti is the desire to satisfy the senses, attracted by five sense
objects—namely, form, taste, sound, smell and touch.

The eleventh attendant, who is the commander of the others, is known
as the mind. He is the leader of the senses both in the acquisition of
knowledge and in the performance of work. The Paiicala kingdom is that
atmosphere in which the five sense objects are enjoyed. Within that
Paiicala kingdom is the city of the body, which has nine gates.

PURPORT

The mind is the center of all activities and is described here as brhad-

bala, very powerful. To get out of the clutches of maya, material existence,

Text 8] Talks Between Narada and King Pracinabarhi 1381
one has to control his mind. According to training, the mind is the friend
and the enemy of the living entity. If one gets a good manager, his estate
is very nicely managed, but if the manager is a thief, his estate is spoiled.
Similarly, in his material conditional existence, the living entity gives
power of attorney to his mind. As such, he is liable to be misdirected by
his mind into enjoying sense objects. Srila Ambarisa Maharaja therefore
first engaged his mind upon the lotus feet of the Lord. Sa vai manah krsna-
padaravindayoh. When the mind is engaged in meditation on the lotus feet
of the Lord, the senses are controlled. This system of control is called
yama, and this means subduing the senses. One who can subdue the senses
is called a gosvami, but one who cannot control the mind is called go-dasa.
The mind directs the activities of the senses, which are expressed through
different outlets, as described in the next verse.

The eyes, nostrils and ears are pairs of gates situated in one place. The

Not being aware of his spiritual position, the living entity, directed by
the mind, goes out through the nine gates to enjoy material objects.
Because of long association with material objects, he forgets his real

spiritual activities and is thus misled. The entire world is going on being
misled by so-called leaders like scientists and philosophers who have
no knowledge of the spirit soul. Thus the conditioned soul becomes more
and more entangled.

the rectum and genital.
PURPORT
Of all the sides, the eastern is considered most important, primarily
because the sun rises from that direction. The gates on the eastern side—
the eyes, nose and mouth—are thus very important gates in the body.

The two gates named Khadyota and Avirmukhi, which have been spoken
of, are the two eyes side by side in one place. The town named Vibhrajita
should be understood as form. In this way the two eyes are always engaged
in seeing different kinds of forms.
PURPORT
The two eyes are attracted by brilliant things like light. Sometimes we
find that little insects are attracted by the brightness of fire and thus enter
into it. Similarly, the two eyes of the living entity are attracted by bright
and beautiful forms. They are entangled in these forms, exactly as the
insect becomes attracted to fire.

1384 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 29
TRANSLATION

The two doors named Nalini and Nalini should be known as the two
nostrils, and the city named Saurabha represents aroma. The companion
spoken of as Avadhita is the sense of smell. The door called Mukhya is
the mouth, and Vipana is the faculty of speech. Rasajiia is the sense of
taste.

PURPORT

The word avadhiita means “most free.” A person is not under the rules
and regulations of any injunction when he has attained the stage of
avadhiita. In other words, he can act as he likes. This avadhiita is exactly
like air, which does not care for any obstruction. In Bhagavad-gita it is said:

caficalam hi manah krspa
pramathi balavad drdham
tasyahar nigraham manye
vayor iva suduskaram
“For the mind is restless, turbulent, obstinate and very strong, O Krsna,
and to subdue it is, it seems to me, more difficult than controlling the
wind.” (Bg. 6.34)

Just as the air or wind cannot be checked by anyone, the two nostrils,
situated in one place, enjoy the sense of smell without impediment. When
the tongue is present, the mouth continually tastes all kinds of relishable
foodstuffs.

TRANSLATION

Narada Muni continued: The city spoken of as Daksina-paricala repre-
sents the scriptures meant for directing pravrtti, the process of sense
enjoyment in fruitive activities. The other city, named Uttara-paiicala,
represents the scriptures meant for decreasing fruitive activities and
increasing knowledge. The living entity receives different kinds of knowl-
edge by means of two ears, and some living entities are promoted to
Pitrloka and some to Devaloka. All this is made possible by the two ears.

PURPORT

The Vedas are known as sruti, and the knowledge received from them
through aural reception is called $rutadhara. As stated in Bhagavad-gita,
one can be promoted to the planets of the demigods or to the planets of
the pitas (forefathers), or even to the Vaikuntha planets, simply through
the process of hearing. These things have already been explained in
previous chapters.

TRANSLATION
The city called Gramaka, which is approached through the lower gate
of Asuri [the genital], is meant for sex, which is very pleasing to common
men who are simply fools and rascals. The faculty of procreation is called
Durmada, and the rectum is called Nirrti.
PURPORT
When the world becomes degraded, civilization becomes demoniac, and
for the common man the rectum and the genital are taken very seriously
as the centers of all activity. Even in such a sacred place as Vrndavana,
India, unintelligent men pass off this rectal and genital business as spiritual
activity. Such people are called sahajiya. According to their philosophy,
through sexual indulgence one can elevate oneself to the spiritual plat-
form. From these verses of Srimad-Bhdgavatam, however, we understand
that the desires for sexual satisfaction are meant for the arvak, the lowest
among men. To rectify these rascals and fools is very difficult. After all,
the sex desires of the common man are condemned in these verses. The
word durmada means “wrongly directed,” and nirrti means “sinful
activity.” Although this clearly indicates that sex indulgence is abominable
and misdirected even from the ordinary point of view, the sahajiyas
nonetheless pass themselves off as devotees conducting spiritual activities.
For this reason, Vrndavana is no longer visited by intelligent men. Some-
times we are often asked why we have made our center in Vrndavana.


--- Page 252 ---
Text 16] Talks Between Narada and King Pracinabarhi 1387
From the external point of view, it can be concluded that Vrndavana has
become degenerate due to these sahajiya activities, yet from the spiritual
point of view, Vrndavana is the only place where all these sinful persons
can be rectified by means of taking birth in the forms of dogs, hogs and
monkeys. By living in Vrndavana as a dog, hog or monkey, the living
entity can be elevated to the spiritual platform in the next life.

by the hands and legs, the living entity performs all kinds of work and
moves hither and thither.

TRANSLATION
The word antahpura refers to the heart. The word visiicina, meaning
“going everywhere,” indicates the mind. Within the mind the living entity
enjoys the effects of the modes of material nature. These effects sometimes
cause illusion, sometimes satisfaction and sometimes jubilation.
PURPORT
The mind and intelligence of the living entity in material existence are
affected by the modes of material nature, and according to the association
of the material modes, the mind is habituated to go here and there. The
heart feels satisfaction, jubilation or illusion according to the effects of
the modes of material nature. Actually the living entity in his material
condition remains inert. It is the modes of material nature that act on the
mind and heart. The results are enjoyed or suffered by the living entity.
This is clearly stated in Bhagavad-gita:
prakrteh kriyamanani
gunaih karmani sarvasah
ahankara-vimadhatma

“The bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of
material nature, thinks himself the doer of activities that are in actuality
carried out by nature.” (Bg. 3.27)

TRANSLATION
Formerly it was explained that the Queen is one’s intelligence. While
one is awake or asleep, that intelligence creates different situations. Being
influenced by contaminated intelligence, the living entity envisions some-
thing and simply imitates the actions and reactions of his intelligence.
PURPORT
The Queen of Puraiijana is described herein as intelligence itself. Intelli-
gence acts both in the dream state and in the waking state, but it is con-
taminated by the three modes of material nature. Since the intelligence
is contaminated, the living entity is also contaminated. In the conditioned
state, the living entity acts according to his contaminated intelligence.
Although he simply remains an observer, he nonetheless acts, being forced
by a contaminated intelligence, which in reality is a passive agent.

TRANSLATION
Narada Muni continued: What I referred to as the chariot was in actuality
the body. The senses are the horses that pull that chariot. As time passes,
year after year, these horses run without obstruction, but in fact they
make no progress. Pious and impious activities are the two wheels of the
chariot. The three modes of material nature are the chariot’s flags. The
five types of life air constitute the living entity’s bondage, and the mind is
considered to be the rope. Intelligence is the chariot driver. The heart is the
sitting place in the chariot, and the dualities of life, such as pleasure and
pain, are the knotting place. The seven elements are the coverings of the
chariot, and the working senses are the five external processes. The eleven
senses are the soldiers. Being engrossed in sense enjoyment, the living
entity, seated on the chariot, hankers after fulfillment of his false desires
and runs after sense enjoyment life after life.
PURPORT
The entanglement of the living entity in sense enjoyment is very nicely
explained in these verses. The word sarmwvatsara, meaning the progress of
time, is significant. Day after day, week after week, fortnight after fort-

Texts 18-20] Talks Between Narada and King Pracinabarhi 1391
night, month after month, year after year, the living entity becomes
entangled in the chariot’s progress. The chariot rests on two wheels,
which are pious and impious activities. The living entity attains a certain
position in life in a particular type of body according to his pious and
impious activities, but his transmigration into different bodies should not
be taken as progress. Real progress is explained in Bhagavad-gita.
janma karma ca me divyam
evam yo vetti tattvatah
tyaktva deham punar janma
naiti mam eti so ’rjuna
“One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities
does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material
world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.” (Bg. 4.9)
One makes real progress when he does not have to take on another
material body. As stated in Caitanya-caritamrta:
eita brahmanda bhart’ ananta jiva-gana
caurasi-laksa yonite karaye bhramana
(Ce. Madhya 19.138)
The living entity is wandering throughout the entire universe and taking
birth in different species on different planets. Thus he moves up and
down, but that is not real progress. Real progress is getting out of this
material world altogether. As stated in Bhagavad-gita:
abrahma-bhuvanal lokah
punar avartino ’rjuna
mam upetya tu kaunteya
punar janma na vidyate
“From the highest planet in the material world down to the lowest, all are
places of misery wherein repeated birth and death take place. But one who
attains to My abode, 0 son of Kunti, never takes birth again.” (Bg. 8.16)
Even if one is promoted to Brahmaloka, the highest planet in the
universe, he has to come down again to the lower planetary systems. Thus
he is wandering up and down perpetually under the influence of the three
modes of material nature. Being illusioned, he thinks he is making progress.
He is like an airplane encircling the earth day and night, incapable of
leaving the earth’s gravitational field. Factually there is no progress
because the airplane is conditioned by the earth’s gravity.


--- Page 257 ---
1392 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 29
Just as a king is seated on a chariot, the living entity is seated in the
body. The sitting place is the heart, and the living entity sits there and
engages in the struggle for existence, which goes on without progress
perpetually. In the words of Narottama dasa Thakura:
karma-kanda, jiana-kanda, kevala visera bhanda,
amrta baliya yebd khdya
nana yoni sada phire, kadarya bhaksana kare,
tara janma adhah-pate yaya
The living entity struggles very hard due to the influence of fruitive
activity and mental speculation and simply gets a different type of body
life after life. He eats all kinds of nonsense and is condemned by his
activities of sense enjoyment. If one really wants to progress in life, he
must give up the ways of karma-kanda and jiiana-kanda, fruitive activities
and mental speculation. Being fixed in Krsna consciousness, one can
become free from the entanglement of birth and death and the vain
struggle for existence. In these verses the words myga-trsnam pradhavati
are very significant because the living entity is influenced by a thirst for
sense enjoyment. He is like a deer that goes to the desert to search out
water. In a desert an animal simply searches in vain for water. Of course
there is no water in the desert, and the animal simply sacrifices his life in
an attempt to find it. Everyone is planning for future happiness, thinking
that somehow or other, if he can reach a certain point, he will be happy.
In actuality, however, when he comes to that point, he sees that there is
no happiness. He then plans to go further and further to another point.
This is called mrga-trspa, and its basis is sense enjoyment in this material
world.

What was previously explained as Candavega, powerful time, is covered
by days and nights, named Gandharvas and Gandharvis. The body’s life
span is gradually reduced by the passage of days and nights, which
number 360.
PURPORT
The word parikrantyd means “by traveling.” The living entity travels
on his chariot day and night during a year consisting of 360 (or more)
days and nights. Life’s progress is taken for the unnecessary labor required
to cover these 360 days and nights of life.

--- Page 259 ---
1394 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 29
PURPORT
Encaged within the body, the living being accepts Kalakanya, old age,
just before death. Yavanesvara is the emblem of death, Yamaraja. Before
going to the place of Yamaraja, the living entity accepts jara, old age, the
sister of Yamaraja. One is subjected to the influence of Yavana-raja and his
sister due to impious activity. Those who are in Krsna consciousness and
are engaged in devotional service under the instructions of Narada Muni
are not subjected to the influence of Yamaraja and his sister jara. If one is
Krsna conscious, he conquers death. After leaving the material body, he
does not accept another body that is material but returns home, back to
Godhead. This is verified by Bhagavad-gita (4.9).

TRANSLATION

The followers of Yavanesdvara [ Yamaraja] are called the soldiers of
death, and they are known as the various types of disturbances that pertain
to the body and mind. Prajvara represents the two types of fever: extreme
heat and extreme cold—typhoid and pneumonia. The living entity lying
down within the body is disturbed by many tribulations pertaining to
providence, to other living entities and to his own body and mind. Despite
all kinds of tribulations, the living entity, subjected to the necessities of
the body, mind and senses and suffering from various types of disease, is
carried away by many plans due to his lust to enjoy the world. Although
transcendental to this material existence, the living entity, out of ignorance,
accepts all these material miseries under the pretext of false egoism (I and
mine). In this way he lives for a hundred years within this body.

PURPORT

In the Vedas it is stated: asaiigo ’yam purusah. The living entity is
actually separate from material existence, for the soul is not material.
In Bhagavad-gita it is also said that the living entity is the superior energy,
and the material elements—earth, water, fire, air and so on—are the inferior
energy. The material elements are also described as bhinna, or separated
energy. When the internal or superior energy comes in contact with the
external energy, it is subjected to so many tribulations. In Bhagavad-gita
the Lord also says:

madtra-sparsas tu kaunteya
Sitosna-sukha-duhkha-dah
dagamapdyino ‘nityas
tams titiksasva 601670८0


--- Page 261 ---
1396 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 29
0 son of Kunti, the nonpermanent appearance of happiness and distress,
and their disappearance in due course, are like the appearance and disap-
pearance of winter and summer seasons. They arise from sense perception,
O scion of Bharata, and one must learn to tolerate them without being
disturbed.” (Bg. 2.14)

Because of the material body, the living entity is subjected to many
tribulations brought about by air, water, fire, extreme heat, extreme cold,
sunshine, excessive eating, unhealthy food, maladjustments of the three
elements of the body (kapha, pitta and vdyu), and so on. The intestines,
the throat, the brain and the other parts of the body are affected by all
kinds of diseases that are so powerful that they become sources of extreme
suffering for the living entity. The living entity, however, is different from
all these material elements. The two types of fever described in this verse
can be explained in contemporary language as pneumonia and typhoid.
When there is an extreme fever in the body, there is typhoid and
pneumonia, and they are described as Prajvara. There are also other
miseries created by other living entities. The state exacts taxes, and there
are also many thieves, rogues and cheaters. Miseries brought about by other
living entities are called adhibhautika. There are also miseries in the form
of famine, pestilence, scarcity, war, earthquakes and so on. These are
caused by the demigods or other sources beyond our control. Actually
there are many enemies of the living entities, and these are all described
to point out how miserable this material existence is.

Knowing the basic misery of material existence, one should be induced
to get out of the material clutches and return home, back to Godhead.
Actually the living entity is not at all happy in this material body. Because
of the body, he suffers thirst and hunger and is influenced by the mind,
by words, by anger, by the belly, by the genitals, by the rectum, and so
on. Manifold miseries encircle the transcendental living entity simply
because he desires to satisfy his senses in this material world. If he simply
withdraws from activities of sense gratification and applies his senses in
the service of the Lord, all the problems of material existence will
immediately diminish, and, with the advancement of Krsna consciousness,
he will be freed from all tribulation and, after giving up the body, will
return home, back to Godhead.

TRANSLATION
The living entity by nature has minute independence to choose his own
good or bad fortune, but when he forgets his supreme master, the Per-
sonality of Godhead, he gives himself up unto the modes of material nature.
Being influenced by the modes of material nature, he identifies himself
with the body and, for the interest of the body, becomes attached to
various activities. Sometimes he is under the influence of the mode of
ignorance, sometimes the mode of passion, and sometimes the mode of
goodness. The living entity thus gets different types of bodies under the
modes of material nature.
PURPORT
These different types of bodies are explained in Bhagavad-gita:
purusah prakrti-stho hi
bhuiikte prakrti-jan gunan
karanam guna-saingo sya
sad-asad-yoni-janmasu


--- Page 263 ---
1398 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 29
“The living entity in material nature thus follows the ways of life,
enjoying the three modes of nature. This is due to his association with
that material nature. Thus he meets with good and evil amongst various
species.” (Bg. 13.22)

Because of associating with the modes of nature, the living entity gets a
variety of bodies from the 8,400,000 forms. It is clearly explained herein
that the living entity has a little independence, indicated by the word
sva-drk, meaning “one who can see his own welfare.” The living entity’s
constitutional position is very minute, and he can be misled in his choice.
He may choose to imitate the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A servant
may desire to start his own business and imitate his master, and when he
chooses to do so, he may leave the protection of his master. Sometimes
he is a failure, and sometimes he is successful. Similarly, the living entity,
part and parcel of Krsna, starts his own business to compete with the
Lord. There are many competitors out to attain the Lord’s position, but
to become like the Lord is not at all possible. Thus there is a great struggle
for existence within the material world as different parties try to imitate
the Lord. Material bondage is caused by deviation from the service of the
Lord and attempts to imitate Him. The Lord is imitated by Mayavadi
philosophers who try to become one with the Lord in an artificial way.
When the Mayavadi philosophers think of themselves as liberated, they
are under the delusion of mental concoction. No one can become one
with or equal to God. To imagine this is to continue one’s bondage in
material existence.

TRANSLATION

Those who are situated in the mode of goodness act piously according
to Vedic injunctions. Thus they are elevated to the higher planetary sys-
tems where the demigods live. Those who are influenced by the mode of
passion engage in various types of productive activities in the planetary
systems where human beings live. Similarly, those influenced by the mode
of darkness are subjected to various types of misery and live in the animal
kingdom.

PURPORT

There are three planetary systems—upper, middle and lower. Those
influenced by the mode of goodness are given places in the upper planetary
systems—Brahmaloka (Satyaloka), Tapoloka, Janaloka and Maharloka.
Those influenced by the mode of passion are given places in the Bhiirloka
and Bhuvarloka. Those influenced by the mode of ignorance are given
places in Atala, Vitala, Sutala, Talatala, Mahatala, Rasatala, Patala or the
animal kingdom. Qualitatively the living entity is the same as the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, but because of his forgetfulness he gets different
bodies in different planetary systems. At the present moment human
society is overly influenced by the mode of passion, and consequently
people are engaged in working in big factories. They forget how distressful
it is to live in such places. In Bhagavad-gita such activities are described as
ugra-karma, that is, distressful activities. Those who utilize the energies of
the worker are called capitalists, and those who actually perform the work
are called laborers. In actuality they are both capitalists, and the workers
are in the modes of passion and ignorance. The result is that there is always
a distressful situation. In contrast to these men are those influenced by the
mode of goodness—the karmis and jiianis. The karmis, under the direction
of Vedic instructions, try to elevate themselves to higher planetary sys-
tems. The jiidnis try to merge into the existence of Brahman, the imper-
sonal feature of the Lord. In this way all classes of living entities in various
species of life are existing within this material world. This explains superior
and inferior life forms within the material world.

TRANSLATION

Covered by the mode of ignorance in material nature, the living entity
is sometimes a male, sometimes a female, sometimes a eunuch, sometimes
a human being, sometimes a demigod, sometimes a bird, an animal, and so
on. In this way he is wandering within the material world. His acceptance
of different types of bodies is brought about by his activities under the
influence of the modes of nature.

PURPORT

Actually, the living entity is part and parcel of the Lord; therefore he is
spiritual in quality. The living entity is never material, and his material
conception is simply a mistake due to forgetfulness. He is as brilliant as
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Both the sun and the sunshine are
very brilliant. The Lord is like the full shining sun, and the living entities
are like the small particles of that sun which constitute the all-pervasive
sunshine. When these small particles are covered by the cloud of maya,
they lose their shining capacity. When the cloud of mdyd is gone, the
particles again become brilliant and shining. As soon as the living entity is
covered by the ignorance of maya or darkness, he cannot understand his
relationship with the Supreme God. Somehow or other, if he comes before
the Lord, he can see himself as shining as the Supreme Lord, although he
is not as extensive as the Lord. Because the living entity desires to imitate
the Supreme Lord, he is covered by mdyd. We cannot imitate the Lord,
nor can we become the supreme enjoyer. This is not possible, and when
we think it is, we become conditioned by mdya. Thus the encagement of
the living entity under the clutches of maya is brought about by forgetful
ness of his relationship with the Supreme Lord.

Under the influence of mdyd, the living entity becomes exactly like a
person haunted by a ghost. Such a person speaks all kinds of nonsense.


--- Page 266 ---
Text 29] Talks Between Narada and King Pracinabarhi 1401
When the living entity is covered by the influence of maya, he becomes a
so-called scientist, philosopher, politician or socialist, and at every moment
presents different plans for the benefit of human society. All these plans are
ultimately failures because they are illusory. In this way the living entity for-
gets his position as an eternal servant of the Lord. He instead becomes a ser-
vant of maya. In any case he remains a servant. It is his misfortune that by
forgetting his real contact with the Supreme Lord, he becomes a servant of
maya. As servant of maya, he sometimes becomes a king, sometimes an
ordinary citizen, sometimes a brdhmana, a $itdra, and so on.Sometimes
he is a happy man, sometimes a prosperous man, sometimes a small insect.
Sometimes he is in heaven, and sometimes in hell. Sometimes he is a demi-
god, and sometimes he is a demon. Sometimes he is a servant, and some-
times he is a master. In this way the living entity wanders all over the
universe. Only when he comes in contact with the bona fide spiritual
master can he understand his real constitutional position. He then becomes
disgusted with material existence. At that time, in full Krsna conscious-
ness, he regrets his past experiences in material existence. This regret is
very beneficial because it purifies the living entity of material conditional
life. He then prays to the Lord to engage in His service, and, at that time,
Krsna grants liberation from the clutches of maya. Lord Krsna explains
this in Bhagavad-gita:
daivi hy esd gunamayi
mama maya duratyayd
mam eva ye prapadyante

mdyam etam taranti te
“This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material
nature, is difficult to overcome. But those who have surrendered unto Me
can easily cross beyond it.” (Bg. 7.14)

Only by the grace of Krsna can one get out of the clutches of maya. It
is not possible to get out by mental speculation or other activities. When
the living entity understands his real position by the grace of Krsna, he
keeps himself always fit in Krsna consciousness and acts accordingly. Thus
he gradually becomes completely free from the clutches of maya. When he
is strong in Krsna consciousness, maya cannot touch him. In this way, in
the association of Krsna conscious devotees, the living entity can get free
from the contamination of material existence. In this connection, Srila
Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami says:

tate krsna bhaje, kare gurura sevana
mdya-jala chute, paya krsnera carana


--- Page 267 ---
1402 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 29
“In the Krsna conscious state, the living entity engages in devotional
service under the direction of the spiritual master. In this way he gets out
of the clutches of maya and takes shelter under the lotus feet of Lord
Krsna.” (Cc. Madhya 22.25)

The living entity is exactly like a dog, who, overcome with hunger,
goes from door to door for some food. According to his destiny, he some-
times receives punishment and is driven out and at other times receives a
little food to eat. Similarly, the living entity, being influenced by so many
desires, wanders in different species of life according to destiny. Some-

times he is high, and sometimes he is low. Sometimes he goes to the
heavenly planets, sometimes to hell, sometimes to the middle planets and
80 on.

PURPORT

The living entity’s position is herein likened to a dog’s. By chance a dog
may have a very rich owner, and by chance he may become a street dog.
As the dog of a rich man, he will live very opulently. Sometimes in Western
countries we hear of a master leaving millions of dollars to a dog in his
will. Of course there are many dogs loitering in the street without food.
Therefore, to liken the conditional existence of the living entity to that of
a dog is very appropriate. An intelligent human being, however, can under-
stand that if he has to live the life of a dog, he had best become Krsna’s
dog. In the material world a dog is sometimes elevated and is sometimes
on the street, but in the spiritual world, Krsna’s dog is perpetually, eternally
happy. Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura has therefore sung: vaispava thakura
tomdra kukura baliya janaha more. In this way Bhaktivinoda Thakura offers
to become 8 Vaignava’s dog. A dog always keeps himself at his master’s door
and does not allow any person unfavorable to the master to enter. Simi-
larly, one should engage in the service of a Vaignava and try to please him
in every respect. Unless one does so, he does not make spiritual advance-
ment. Apart from spiritual advancement, in the material world if one does
not develop his qualities in goodness, he cannot be promoted to the higher
planetary system. As confirmed by Bhagavad-gita:

ardhvam gacchanti sattva-stha
madhye tisthanti rajasah
jaghanya-guna-vrtti-stha
adho gacchanti tamasah
“Those situated in the mode of goodness gradually go upward to the
higher planets; those in the mode of passion live on the earthly planets;
and those in the mode of ignorance go down to the hellish worlds.”(Bg.
14.18)

There are many varieties of life in the different planetary systems, and
these come about due to the living entity’s developing his qualities in
goodness, passion and ignorance. If one is in goodness, he is promoted to
the higher systems; if in passion, he remains in the middle systems; and, if
in ignorance, he is pushed down to the lower species of life.

TRANSLATION
The living entities are trying to counteract different miserable conditions
pertaining to providence, other living entities, or the body and mind. Still,
they must remain conditioned by the laws of nature, despite all attempts
to counter these laws.
PURPORT
Just as a dog wanders here and there for a piece of bread or punishment,
the living entity perpetually wanders about trying to be happy and plan-
ning in so many ways to counteract material misery. This is called the
struggle for existence. We can actually see in our daily lives how we are
forced to make plans to drive away miserable conditions. To get rid of one
miserable condition, we have to put ourselves in another kind of miserable
condition. A poor man suffers for want of money, but if he wants to
become rich, he has to struggle in so many ways. Actually that is not a
valid counteracting process but a snare of the illusory energy. If one does
not endeavor to counteract his situation but is satisfied with his position,
knowing that he has obtained his position through past activities, he can
instead engage his energy to develop Krsna consciousness. This is recom-
mended in all Vedic literature.

“Persons who are actually intelligent and philosophically inclined should
endeavor only for that purposeful end which is not obtainable even by
wandering from the topmost planet [Brahmaloka] down to the lowest
planet [Patala]. As far as happiness derived from sense enjoyment is con-
cerned, it can be obtained automatically in course of time, just as in
course of time we obtain miseries even though we do not desire them.”
(Bhag. 1.5.18) One should simply try to develop his Krsna consciousness
and not waste his time trying to improve his material condition. Actually
the material condition cannot be improved. The process of improvement
means accepting another miserable condition. However, if we endeavor
to improve our Krsna consciousness, the distresses of material life will
disappear without extraneous endeavor. Krsna therefore promises:
ksiprari bhavati dharmatma
sasvac-chantim nigacchati
kaunteya pratijanihi
na me bhaktah pranasyati
“He quickly becomes righteous and attains lasting peace. O son of Kunti,
declare it boldly that My devotee never perishes.” (Bg. 9.31)

One who takes to the path of devotional service will never be vanquished,
despite all miseries of the body and mind and despite all misery brought
about by other living entities and providence, miseries which are beyond
our control.

shoulder. In this way he tries to relieve himself of the burden. However,
whatever process he devises to counteract the burden does nothing more
than put the same burden from one place to another.
PURPORT

This is a good description of an attempt to transfer a burden from one
place to another. When one gets tired of keeping a burden on his head, he
will place it on his shoulder. This does not mean that he has become freed
from the strains of carrying the burden. Similarly, human society in the
name of civilization is creating one kind of trouble to avoid another kind
of trouble. In contemporary civilization we see that there are many auto-
mobiles manufactured to carry us swiftly from one place to another, but
at the same time we have created other problems. We have to construct so
many roads, and yet these roads are insufficient to cope with automobile
congestion and traffic jams. There are also the problems of air pollution and
fuel shortage. The conclusion is that the processes we manufacture to
counteract or minimize our distresses do not actually put an end to our
pains. It is all simply illusion. We simply place the burden from the head
to the shoulder. The only real way we can minimize our problems is to
surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead and give ourselves up
to His protection. The Lord, being all-powerful, can make arrangements to
mitigate our painful life in material existence.

TRANSLATION हि

Narada continued: 0 you who are free from all sinful activity! No one
can counteract the effects of fruitive activity simply by manufacturing a
different activity devoid of Krsna consciousness. All such activity is due to
our ignorance. When we have a troublesome dream, we cannot relieve it
with a troublesome hallucination. One can counteract a dream only by
awaking. Similarly, our material existence is due to ignorance and illusion.
Unless we awaken to Krsna consciousness, we cannot be relieved of such
dreams. For the ultimate solution to all problems, we must awaken to
Krsna consciousness.

PURPORT

There are two kinds of fruitive activity. We can place the burden on the
head, or we can place it on the shoulder. Actually, keeping the burden in
either place is the same. The transferral, however, is taking place under the
name of counteraction. In this connection Prahlada Maharaja said that fools
and rascals in the material world plan so gorgeously for bodily comfort
without knowing that such arrangements, even if successful, are only maya.
People are working hard day and night for the illusory happiness of the
body. This is not a way to achieve happiness. One has to get out of this
material entanglement and return home, back to Godhead. That is real
happiness. The Vedas therefore enjoin: “Don’t remain in the darkness of
this material world. Go to the light of the spiritual world.” To counteract
the distress of this material body, one has to take on another distressed
condition. Both situations are only illusion. There is no gain in taking on
one trouble to counteract another trouble. The conclusion is that one
cannot be perpetually happy as long as one exists in this material world.
The only remedy is to get out of this material world altogether and return
home, back to Godhead.

TRANSLATION

Sometimes we suffer because we see a tiger in a dream or a snake in a
vision, but actually there is neither a tiger nor a snake. Thus we create
some situation in a subtle form and suffer the consequences. These suffer-
ings cannot be mitigated unless we are awakened from our dream.

PURPORT

As stated in the Vedas, the living entity is always separate from two
kinds of material bodies—the subtle and the gross. All our sufferings are
due to these material bodies. This is explained in Bhagavad-gita:

matrd-sparsas tu kaunteya
Sitosna-sukha-duhkha-dah
agamapdyino ’nityds
tams titiksasva bharata
“O son of Kunti, the nonpermanent appearance of happiness and distress,
and their disappearance in due course, are like the appearance and disap-
pearance of winter and summer seasons. They arise from sense perception,
O scion of Bharata, and one must learn to tolerate them without being
disturbed.” (Bg. 2.14)

Lord Krsna thus informed Arjuna that all the distresses brought about
by the body come and go. One has to learn how to tolerate them. Material
existence is the cause of all our sufferings, for we do not suffer once we
are out of the material condition. The Vedas therefore enjoin that one
should factually understand that he is not material butis actually Brahman,
(ahariv brahmasmi). This understanding cannot be fully realized unless one
is engaged in Brahman activities, namely devotional service. To get free
from the material conditions, one has to take to Krsna consciousness. That
is the only remedy.

TRANSLATION
The real interest of the living entity is to get out of the nescience that
causes him to endure repeated birth and death. The only remedy is to
surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead through His represen-
tative. Unless one renders devotional service unto the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, Vasudeva, he cannot possibly become completely detached
from this material world, nor can he possibly manifest real knowledge.
PURPORT
This is the way to become detached from the artificial material condition.
The only remedy is to take to Krsna consciousness and constantly engage
in the devotional service of Lord Vasudeva, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Everyone is trying to be happy, and the process adopted to
achieve that happiness 15 called self-interest. Unfortunately the conditioned
soul hovering within this material world does not know that his ultimate


--- Page 275 ---
1410 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 29
goal of self-interest is Vasudeva. ৩৫578, or material existence, begins with
the illusioned bodily conception of life, and on the basis of this conception
there ensues a series of unwanted things (anarthas). These unwanted things
are actually mental desires for various types of sense gratification. In this
way one accepts different types of bodies within this material world. One
first has to control the mind so that the desires of the mind can be
purified. This process is described in the Narada-paiicaratra as sarvopadhi-
vinirmuktam tat-paratvena nirmalam. Unless one purifies his mind, there is
no question of getting free from the material condition. As stated in
Srimad-Bhagavatam:
anarthopasamari saksad
bhakti-yogam adhoksaje
lokasydjanato vidvarms
cakre satvata-sarihitam

“The material miseries of the living entity, which are superfluous to him,
can be directly mitigated by the linking process of devotional service. But
the mass of people do not know this, and therefore the learned Vyasadeva
compiled this Vedic literature, which is in relation to the Supreme Truth.”
(Bhag. 1.7.6) Anarthas, unwanted things, come down from one bodily
life to another. To get out of this entanglement, one has to take to the
devotional service of Lord Vasudeva, Krsna, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. The word guru is significant in this connection. The word guru
may be translated as “heavy,” or “the supreme.” In other words, the guru
is the spiritual master. Srila Rsabhadeva advised his sons: gurur na sa syat. . .
na mocayed yah samupeta-mrtyum. “One should not take up the post of
spiritual master unless is able to lead his disciple from the cycle of birth
and death.” (Bhag. 5.5.18) Material existence is actually a chain of action
and reaction brought about by different types of fruitive activities. This is
the cause of birth and death. One can stop this process only by engaging
oneself in the service of Vasudeva.

Bhakti refers to those activities performed in the service of Lord
Vasudeva. Because Lord Vasudeva is the Supreme, one should engage
himself in His service, not in the service of the demigods. Devotional
service begins from the neophyte stage—the stage of observing the rules
and regulations—and extends to the point of spontaneous loving service to
the Lord. The purpose of all stages is to satisfy Lord Vasudeva. When one
is perfectly advanced in the devotional service of Vasudeva, he becomes
completely detached from the service of the body, that is, his designated


--- Page 276 ---
Text 38] Talks Between Narada and King Pracinabarhi 1411
position in material existence. After becoming so detached, one becomes
actually perfect in knowledge and engages perfectly in the service of Lord
Vasudeva. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu says: jivera ‘svaripa’ haya— krsnera
‘nitya-dasa’. “Every living entity is by constitutional position an eternal
servant of Krsna.” As soon as one engages in the service of Lord Vasudeva,
he attains his normal constitutional position. This position is called the
liberated stage. Muktir hitvanyatha ripam svaripena vyavasthitih: in the
liberated stage one is situated in his original Krsna conscious position. He
gives up all engagement in the service of matter, engagements concocted
under the names of social service, national service, community service, dog
service, automobile service, and so many other services conducted under
the illusion of “I” and “mine.”
As explained in the Second Chapter of the First Canto:
vasudeve bhagavati
bhakti-yogah prayojitah
Janayaty asu vairagyam

jianam ca yad ahaitukam
“By rendering devotional service unto the Personality of Godhead, Sri
Krsna, one immediately acquires causeless knowledge and detachment
from the world.” (Bhag. 1.2.7) Thus one must engage in the service of
Vasudeva without material desire, mental speculation or fruitive activity.

TRANSLATION

My dear king, in the place where pure devotees live, following the rules
and regulations and thus purely conscious and engaged with great eagerness
in hearing and chanting the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
in that place if one gets a chance to hear their constant flow of nectar,
which is exactly like the waves of a river, one will forget the necessities of
life—namely hunger and thirst—and become immune to all kinds of fear,
lamentation and illusion.

PURPORT

The cultivation of Krsna consciousness is possible where great devotees
live together and constantly engage in hearing and chanting the glories of
the Lord. In a holy place like Vrndavana, there are many devotees constantly
engaged in chanting and hearing the glories of the Lord. If one gets the
chance to hear from pure devotees in such a place, allowing the constant
flow of the river of nectar to come from the mouth of pure devotees, then
the cultivation of Krsna consciousness becomes very easy. When one is
engaged in constantly hearing the glories of the Lord, he certainly rises
above the bodily conception. When one is in the bodily conception, he feels
the pangs of hunger and thirst, fear, lamentation and illusion. But when one
is engaged in hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord, he transcends
the bodily conception.

The word bhagavad-gunanukathana-§ravana-vyagra-cetasah, meaning
“always eager to find the place where the glories of the Lord are being
heard and chanted,” is significant in this verse. A businessman is always
very eager to go to a place where business is transacted. Similarly, a devotee
is very eager to hear from the lips of liberated devotees. As soon as one
hears the glories of the Lord from the liberated devotees, he immediately
becomes impregnated with Krsna consciousness. This is also confirmed in
another verse:

“In the association of pure devotees, discussion of the pastimes and activi-
ties of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is very pleasing and satisfying
to the ear and to the heart. By cultivating such knowledge one gradually
becomes advanced on the path of liberation, and thereafter he is freed, and
his attraction becomes fixed. Then real devotion and devotional service
begin.” (Bhdg. 3.25.25) In the association of pure devotees, one becomes
attached to hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord. In this way one
can cultivate Krsna consciousness, and as soon as this cultivation is
advanced, one can become faithful to the Lord, devoted to the Lord and
attached to the Lord, and thus one can very quickly attain full Krsna
consciousness. The secret of success in the cultivation of Krsna conscious-
ness is hearing from the right person. A Krsna conscious person is never
disturbed by the bodily necessities—namely, eating, sleeping, mating and
defending.

Texts 42-44] Talks Between Narada and King Pracinabarhi 1415
PURPORT
Unless one is associated with devotees, he cannot cultivate Krsna con-
sciousness. Nirjana-bhajana—cultivating Krsna consciousness in a solitary
place—is not possible for the neophyte, for he will be disturbed by the
bodily necessities (eating, sleeping, mating and defending). Being so dis-
turbed, one cannot cultivate Krsna consciousness. We therefore see that
devotees known as sahajiyad, who make everything very easy, do not asso-
ciate with advanced devotees. Such persons, in the name of devotional
activities, are addicted to all kinds of sinful acts—illicit sex, intoxication,
gambling, and meat-eating. There are also many so-called devotees passing
themselves off as devotees while engaging in these sinful activities. In other
words, one who is influenced by sinful activity cannot be accepted as a
person in Krsna consciousness. A person addicted to sinful life cannot
develop Krsna consciousness, as indicated in this verse.

The most powerful Lord Brahma, the father of all progenitors; Lord
Siva, Manu, Daksa and the other rulers of humankind; the four saintly
first-class brahmacaris headed by Sanaka and Sanatana; the great sages
Marici, Atri, Arigira, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, Bhrgu and Vasistha; and my
humble self [Narada] are all stalwart brahmanas who can speak authorita-
tively on Vedic literature. We are very powerful because of austerities,
meditation and education. Nonetheless, even after inquiring about the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, whom we always see, we do not know
perfectly about Him.

PURPORT

According to the foolish Darwinian theory of the anthropologists, it is
said that 40,000 years ago Homo sapiens had not appeared on this planet
because the process of evolution had not reached that point. However, the
Vedic histories—the Puranas and Mahabharata—relate human histories that
extend millions and millions of years into the past. In the beginning of
creation, there was a very intelligent personality, Lord Brahma, and from
him emanated all the Manus, the breahmacaris like Sanaka and Sanatana,
as well as Lord Siva, the great sages and Narada. All these personalities
underwent great austerities and penances and thus became authorities in
Vedic knowledge. Perfect knowledge for human beings, as well as all living
entities, is contained in the Vedas. All the above-mentioned great per-
sonalities are not only powerful—being cognizant of past, present and
future—but are also devotees. Still, in spite of their great education in
knowledge, and despite their meeting the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Lord Vignu, they cannot actually understand the perfection of the living


--- Page 282 ---
Texts 42-44] Talks Between Narada and King Pracinabarhi 1417
entity’s relationship with Lord Vigpu. This means that these personalities
are still limited as far as their knowledge of the unlimited is concerned.
The conclusion is that simply by advancing one’s knowledge, one cannot
be accepted as an expert in understanding the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. The Supreme Personality of Godhead can be understood not by
advanced knowledge but by pure devotional service, as confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita:

“One can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional
service. And when one is in full consciousness of the Supreme Lord by
such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of God.” (Bg. 18.55)

Unless one takes to pure transcendental devotional service, he cannot
understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead in truth. Everyone has
some imperfect ideas about the Lord. So-called scientists and philosophical
speculators are unable to understand the Supreme Lord by virtue of their
knowledge. Knowledge is not perfect unless one comes to the platform of
devotional service. This is confirmed by the Vedic version:

athapi te deva padambuja-dvaya-
prasada-lesanugrhita eva hi
jandti tattvam bhagavan mahimno
na canya eko ‘pi ciram vicinvan
(Bhdg. 10.14.29)
The speculators, the jiianis, go on speculating about the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead for many many hundreds of thousands of years, but
unless one is favored by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one cannot
understand His supreme glories. All the great sages mentioned in this
verse have their planets near Brahmaloka, the planet where Lord Brahma
resides along with four great sages—Sanaka, Sanatana, Sanandana and
Sanat-kumara. These sages reside in different stars known as the southern
stars, which circle the pole star. The pole star, called Dhruvaloka, is the
pivot of this universe, and all planets move around this pole star. All the
stars are planets, as far as we can see, within this one universe. According
to Western theory, all the stars are different suns, but according to Vedic
information, there is only one sun within this universe. All the so-called
stars are but different planets. Besides this universe, there are many mil-

lions of other universes, and each of them contains similar innumerable
stars and planets.

TRANSLATION

Despite the cultivation of Vedic knowledge, which is unlimited, and the
worship of different demigods by the symptoms of Vedic mantras, demigod
worship does not help one to understand the Supreme Powerful Personality
of Godhead.

PURPORT
As stated in Bhagavad-gita:

“Those whose minds are distorted by material desires surrender unto
demigods and follow the particular rules and regulations of worship accord-
ing to their own natures.” (Bg. 7.20)

Most people are interested in worshiping demigods to acquire powers.
Each demigod has a particular power. For instance, the demigod Indra,
the King of heaven, has power to shower rain on the surface of the globe
to give sufficient vegetation to the earth. This demigod is described in the
Vedas: vajra-hastah purandarah. Indra rules the water supply with a thun-

derboltin his hand. The thunderbolt itself is controlled by Indra. Similarly,
other demigods—Agni, Varuna, Candra, Siirya—have particular powers. All
these demigods are worshiped in the Vedic hymns through a symbolic
weapon. Therefore it is said here: mantra-litigair vyavacchinnam. By such
worship, karmis may obtain the benediction of material opulence in the
form of animals, riches, beautiful wives, many followers, and so on. By
such material opulence, however, one cannot understand the Supreme
Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION
When a person is fully engaged in devotional service, he is favored by
the Lord, who bestows His causeless mercy. At such a time, the awakened
devotee gives up all material activities and ritualistic performances men-
tioned in the Vedas.
PURPORT
In the previous verse, those who are in knowledge have been described
as unable to appreciate the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly,
this verse indicates that those who are followers of the Vedic rituals, as
well as those who are followers of fruitive activities, are unable to see the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. In these two verses both the karmis and
jhanis are described as unfit to understand Him. As described by Srila
Riipa Gosvami, only when one is completely free from mental speculation
and fruitive activity (anyabhilasita-sinyan jiana-karmady-anavrtam) can
one engage in pure devotional service without being polluted by material

1420 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 29
desires. The significant word atma-bhavitah indicates that the Lord is
awakened in one’s mind if one constantly thinks of Him. A pure devotee
is always thinking of the lotus feet of the Lord (sa vai manah krsna-
padaravindayoh). A pure devotee cannot remain a moment without being
absorbed in thoughts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This con-
stant thinking of the Lord is described in Bhagavad-gita as satata-yuktanam,
always engaging in the Lord’s service. Bhajatar priti-parvakam: this is
devotional service in love and affection. Because the Supreme Personality
of Godhead dictates to the pure devotee from within, the devotee is saved
from all material activities. Even the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies are con-
sidered material activities because by such activities one is simply elevated
to other planetary systems, the residential abodes of the demigods. Lord
Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita:
yanti deva-vrata devan
pitin yanti pitr-vratiah
bhatani yanti bhitejya
yanti mad-ydjino [08 mam

“Those who worship the demigods will take birth among the demigods;
those who worship ghosts and spirits will take birth among such beings;
those who worship ancestors go to the ancestors; and those who worship
Me will live with Me.” (Bg. 9.25)

The word atma-bhavitah also indicates that a devotee is always engaged
in preaching to deliver conditioned souls. It is said of the six Gosvamis:
nana-sastra-vicaranaika-nipunpau sad-dharma-sarsthapakau lokanar hita-
karinau. A pure devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is always
thinking of how fallen conditioned souls can be delivered. The Supreme
Personality of Godhead, influenced by the merciful devotees’ attempt to
deliver fallen souls, enlightens the people in general from within by His
causeless mercy. If a devotee is benedicted by another devotee, he becomes
free from karma-kanda and jiiana-kanda activities. As confirmed in Brahma-
sarihitd, vedesu durlabham: the Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot
be realized through karma-kanda and jiana-kanda. Adurlabham atma-
bhaktau: the Lord is realized only by a sincere devotee.

This material world, the cosmic manifestation, is created by the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, and the living entities have come here to enjoy
themselves. The Vedic instructions guide them according to different
regulative principles, and intelligent people take advantage of these instruc-
tions. They thus enjoy material life without being disturbed. This is actually
illusion, and to get out of this illusion by one’s own endeavor is very

Text 46] Talks Between Narada and King Pracinabarhi 1421
difficult. The general populace is engaged in material activities, and when
people are a little advanced, they become attracted by the ritualistic cere-
monies mentioned in the Vedas. However, when one is frustrated in the
performance of these ritualistic ceremonies, he again comes to material
activities. In this way both the followers of the Vedic rituals and the
followers of material activities are entangled in conditional life. These
people get the seed of devotional service only by the good will of the
guru and Krspa. This is confirmed in Caitanya-caritamrta: guru-krsna-
prasade paya bhakti-lata-bija. ॥

When one is engaged in devotional service, he is no longer attracted to
material activities. When a man is covered by different designations, he
cannot engage in devotional service. One has to become freed from such
designative activities (sarvopadhi-vinirmuktam) and become pure in order
to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead through purified senses.
Hrsikena hrsikesa-sevanam bhaktir ucyate: the service of the Lord through
purified senses is called bhakti-yoga or devotional service. The sincere
devotee is always helped by the Supersoul, who resides within the heart
of every living entity, as Lord Krgna confirms in Bhagavad-gita:

tesam satata-yuktanam
bhajatam priti-piirvakam
dadami buddhi-yogari tam
yena mam upayanti te
“To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give
the understanding by which they can come to Me.” (Bg. 10.10)

This is the stage of becoming free from the contamination of the material
world. At such a time a devotee makes friends with another devotee, and
his engagement in material activities ceases completely. At that time,he
attains the favor of the Lord and loses his faith in material civilization,
which begins with varpdsrama-dharma. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu speaks
clearly of one’s becoming liberated from the varnasrama-dharma, the most
exalted system of human civilization. At such a time one feels himself to
be perpetually the servant of Lord Krsna, a position taken by Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu Himself.

grhastha, vanaprastha or sannyasi. What am I? I am the eternal servant of
the servant of the servant of Lord Krsna.” Through the disciplic succession,
one can attain this conclusion, which is perfect elevation to the transcen-
dental platform.

“Men of small knowledge are very much attached to the flowery words of
the Vedas, which recommend various fruitive activities for elevation to
heavenly planets, resultant good birth, power, and so forth. Being desirous
of sense gratification and opulent life, they say that there is nothing more
than this.” (Bg. 2.42-43)

Generally people are very much attracted to the fruitive activities
sanctioned in the Vedic rituals. One may be very much attracted to becom-
ing elevated to heavenly planets by performing great sacrifices, like those
of King Barhigman. Sri Narada Muni wanted to stop King Barhigman from
engaging in such fruitive activities. Therefore he is now directly telling him,
“Don’t be interested in such temporary benefits.” In modern civilization
people are very much interested in exploiting the resources of material
nature through the methods of science. Indeed, this is considered advance-
ment. This is not actually advancement, however, but is simply pleasing to
hear. Although we are advancing according to such concocted methods,
we are nonetheless forgetting our real purpose. Bhaktivinoda Thakura
therefore says: jada-vidyd yata mdydra vaibhava tomdra bhajane badha.
“Materialistic studies are the glare of maya only, for they are an obstacle
to spiritual progress.”

The temporary comforts of life experienced either on this planet or on
other planets are all to be taken as illusory because they do not touch the
real purpose of life. The real purpose of life is to go back home, back to
Godhead. Ignorant of the real purpose of life, people take to either gross
materialistic activities or ritualistic activities. King Barhigman is herein
requested not to be attached to such activities. In the Vedas it is stated
that the performance of sacrifice is the actual purpose of life. A section
of the Indian population known as the Arya Samajists lay too much stress
on the sacrificial portion of the Vedas. This verse indicates, however, that
such sacrifices are to be taken as illusory. Actually the aim of human life
should be God realization, or Krsna consciousness. The Vedic performances
are, of course, very glittering and pleasing to hear about, but they do not
serve the real purpose of life.

Those who are less intelligent accept the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies as
allin all. They do not know that the purpose of the Vedas is to understand
one’s own home, where the Supreme Personality of Godhead lives. Not
being interested in their real home, they are illusioned and search after
other homes.
PURPORT
Generally people are not aware of their interest in life—to return home,
back to Godhead. People do not know about their real home in the spiritual
world. In the spiritual world there are many Vaikuntha planets, and the
topmost planet is Krgnaloka, Goloka Vyndavana. Despite the so-called ad-
vancement of civilization, there is no information of the Vaikunthalokas,
the spiritual planets. At the present moment so-called advanced civilized
men are trying to go to other planets, but they do not know that even if
they go to the highest planetary system, Brahmaloka, they have to come
back again to this planet. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita:
abrahma-bhuvanal lokah
punar davartino ‘rjuna
mam upetya tu kaunteya
punar janma na vidyate
“From the highest planet in the material world down to the lowest, all are
places of misery wherein repeated birth and death take place. But one who
attains to My abode, O son of Kunti, never takes birth again.” (Bg. 8.16)
If one goes to the highest planetary system within thisuniverse he still has
to return after the effects of piousactivities are finished. Space vehicles may
go very high in the sky, but as soon as their fuel is finished, they have to re-
turn to this earthly planet. All these activities are performed in illusion. The
real attempt should now be to return home, back to Godhead. The process

is mentioned in Bhagavad-gita. Yanti mad-ydajino ’pi mam: those who
engage in the devotional service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead
return home, back to Godhead. Human life is very valuable, and one
should not waste it in vain exploration of other planets. One should be
intelligent enough to return to Godhead. One should be interested in infor-
mation about the spiritual Vaikuntha planets, and in particular the planet
known as Goloka Vindavana, and should learn the art of going there by
the simple method of devotional service, beginning with hearing (sravanari
kirtanam visnoh). This is also confirmed in €rtmad Bhagavatam.
kaler dosa-nidhe rajann
asti hy eko mahan gunah
kirtanad eva krsnasya
mukta-sangah param vrajet (Bhag. 12.3.51)
One can go to the supreme planet (0৫7৫7 vrajet) simply by chanting the
Hare Krsna mantra. This is especially meant for the people of this age
(kaler dosa-nidhe). It is the special advantage of this age that simply by
chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra one can become purified of all
material contamination and return home, back to Godhead. There is no
doubt about this.

the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You cannot understand this fact.
Your only activities should be those that can please the Personality of
Godhead. Our education should be such that we can become elevated to

PURPORT
In this verse the great sage Narada Muni directly insults the King because
he was engaged in performing sacrifices that entail the killing of a great
number of animals. The King was thinking that he was great for having
performed so many sacrifices, but the great sage Narada directly chastises
him, informing him that his animal killing only leads to his being puffed up
with false prestige. Actually anything that is done which does not lead to
Krsna consciousness is a sinful activity, and any education that does not
lead one to understand Krsna is false education. If Krsna consciousness is
missing, one is simply engaged in false activities and false educational
pursuits.

Sri Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the Supersoul and
guide of all living entities who have accepted material bodies within this
world. He is the supreme controller of all material activities in material
nature. He is also our best friend, and everyone should take shelter at His
lotus feet. In doing so, one’s life will be auspicious.

PURPORT
In Bhagavad-gita it is said:
isvarah sarva-bhitanar
hrd-dese ’rjuna tisthati
bhramayan sarva-bhatani
yantraridhani mayaya
“The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone’s heart, O Arjuna, and is
directing the wanderings of all living entities, who are seated as on a
machine, made of the material energy.” (Bg. 18.61)

The living entity is within the body, and the Supersoul, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, is also there. He is called antaryami and caitya-
guru. As Lord Krsna states in Bhagavad-gita, He is controlling everything.

sarvasya caham hrdi sannivisto
matah smrtir jianam apohanan ca
vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyo
vedanta-krd veda-vid eva caham
“l am seated in everyone’s heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowl-
edge and forgetfulness. By all the Vedas, ॥ am to be known; indeed 1 am the
compiler of Vedanta, and I am the knower of the Vedas.” (Bg. 15.15)

Everything is being directed by the Supersoul within the body; therefore
the better part of valor is to take His direction and be happy. To take His
directions, one needs to be a devotee, and this 15 also confirmed in Bhagavad-
gita.

“To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give
the understanding by which they can come to Me.” (Bg. 10.10)

Although the Supersoul is in everyone’s heart (iSvarah sarva-bhitanar
hrd-dese 'rjuna tisthati), He talks only to the pure devotees who constantly
engage in His service. In Caitanya-bhagavata it is said:

tahare se bali vidya, mantra, adhyayana

krsna-pada-padme ye karaye sthira mana
“One who has fixed his mind on the lotus feet of Krsna is to be understood
as having the best education and as having studied all the Vedas.” (Cb. Antya
3.45) There are also other appropriate quotes in Caitanya-bhagavata:

sei se vidyara phala janiha niscaya

krsna-pada-padme yadi citta-vriti raya
“The perfect result of an education is the fixing of one’s mind on the
lotus feet of Krsna.” (Cb. Adi 13.178)

‘dig-vijaya kariba, — vidyara karya nahe

iSvare bhajile, sei vidya ‘satya’ kahe
“Conquering the world by means of material education is not desirable. If
one engages himself in devotional service, his education is perfected.”
(Cb. Adi 13.173)

pade kene loka——krsna-bhakti janibare

“The purpose of education is to understand Krsna and His devotional
service. If one does not do so, then education is false.” (Cb. Adi 12.49)

tahare se bali dharma, karma sadacara

iSvare se priti janme sammata sabdra
“Being cultured, educated, very active and religious means developing
natural love for Krsna.” (Cb. Antya 3.44) Everyone has dormant love for
Krsna, and by culture and education that has to be awakened. That is the
purpose of this Krsna consciousness movement. Once Lord Caitanya asked
Sri Ramananda Raya what the best part of education was, and Ramananda

One who is engaged in devotional service has not the least fear in material
existence. This is because the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the
Supersoul and friend of everyone. One who knows this secret is actually
educated, and one thus educated can become the spiritual master of the
world. One who is an actually bona fide spiritual master, representative
of Krsna, is not different from Krsna.
PURPORT
Srila Viévanatha Cakravarti Thakura says: saksad-dharitvena samasta-
Sastrair uktas tatha bhavyata eva sadbhih. The spiritual master is described
in every scripture as the representative of the Supreme Personality of God-
head. The spiritual master is accepted as identical with the Supreme
Personality of Godhead because he is the most confidential servant of the
Lord (kintu prabhor yah priya eva tasya). The purport is that both the
Supersoul and the individual soul are very dear to everyone.
Everyone loves himself, and when he becomes more advanced, he loves
the Supersoul also. A person who is self-realized does not recommend the
worship of anyone but the Supersoul. He knows that to worship the


--- Page 295 ---
1430 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 29
Supreme Personality of Godhead is easier than to worship various demigods
under the influence of lust and the desire for material enjoyment. The
devotee is therefore always engaged in the loving devotional service of the
Lord. Such a person is a true guru. In Padma Purana it is said:
sat-karma-nipuno vipro
mantra-tantra-visaradah
avaisnavo gurur na syad
vaisnavah Sva-paco guruh
“Even if a brahmana is very learned in Vedic scriptures and knows the six
occupational duties of ৪ brahmana, he cannot become a guru or spiritual
master unless he is a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
However, if one is born in a family of dog-eaters but is a pure devotee of
the Lord, he can become a spiritual master.” The conclusion is that one
cannot become a spiritual master unless he is a pure devotee of the Lord.
One who is a spiritual master in accordance with the above descriptions of
devotional service is to be understood as the Supreme Personality of God-
head personally present. According to the words mentioned here (gurur
harih), consulting a bona fide spiritual master means consulting the Su-
preme Personality of Godhead personally. One should therefore take
shelter of such a bona fide spiritual master. Success in life means accepting
a spiritual master who knows Krsna as the only supreme beloved per-
sonality. One should worship such a confidential devotee of the Lord.

PURPORT

Sri Narada Muni is personally acting as the spiritual master of King
Barhigman. It was Narada Muni’s intention that through his instructions
the King would immediately give up all engagement in fruitive activity
and take to devotional service. However, although the King understood
everything, he was still not prepared to give up his engagements. As the
following verses will show, the King was contemplating sending for his
sons, who were away from home executing austerities and penances. After
their return, he would entrust his kingdom to them and then leave home.
This is the position of most people. They accept a bona fide spiritual
master and listen to him, but when the spiritual master indicates that they
should leave home and fully engage in devotional service, they hesitate.
The duty of the spiritual master is to instruct the disciple as long as he
does not come to the understanding that this materialistic way of life,
fruitive activity, is not at all beneficial. Actually one should take to devo-
tional service from the beginning of life, as Prahlada Maharaja advised:
kaumara dcaret prajiio dharman bhagavatan iha (Bhag. 7.6.1). According
to all the instructions of the Vedas, we can understand that unless one
takes to Krsna consciousness and devotional service, he is simply wasting
his time engaging in the fruitive activities of material existence. Narada
Muni therefore decided to relate another allegory to the King so that he
might be induced to give up family life within material existence.

TRANSLATION

My dear King, please search out that deer who is engaged in eating
grass in a very nice flower garden along with his wife. That deer is very
much attached to his business, and he is enjoying the sweet singing of the
bumblebees in his garden. Just try to understand his position. He is unaware
that before him is a tiger which is accustomed to living at the cost of
another’s flesh. Behind the deer is a hunter, who is threatening to pierce
him with sharp arrows. Thus the deer’s death is imminent.

PURPORT

Here is an allegory in which the King is advised to find a deer that is
always in a dangerous position. Although threatened from all sides, the
deer simply eats grass in a nice flower garden, unaware of the danger all
around him. All living entities, especially human beings, think themselves
very happy in the midst of families. As if living in a flower garden and
hearing the sweet humming of bumblebees, everyone is centered around
his wife, who is the beauty of family life. The bumblebees’ humming may
be compared to the talk of children. The human being, just like the deer,
enjoys his family without knowing that before him is the factor of time,
which is represented by the tiger. The fruitive activities of a living entity
simply create another dangerous position and oblige him to accept different
types of bodies. For a deer to run after a mirage of water in the desert is
not unusual. The deer is also very fond of sex. The conclusion is that one
who lives like a deer will be killed in due course of time. Vedic literatures
therefore advise that we should understand our constitutional position
and take to devotional service before death comes. According to the
Bhagavatam:

After many births we have attained this human form; therefore before
death comes, we should engage ourselves in the transcendental loving
service of the Lord. That is the fulfillment of human life.

TRANSLATION

My dear King, woman, who is very attractive in the beginning but in the
end very disturbing, is exactly like the flower, which is attractive in the
beginning and detestable at the end. With woman, the living entity is en-
tangled with lusty desires and sex. He thus enjoys a life of sense gratifica-
tion—from his tongue to his genitals—and in this way the living entity
considers himself very happy in family life. United with his wife, he always
remains absorbed in such thoughts. He feels great pleasure in hearing the
talks of his wife and children, which are like the sweet humming of bumble-
bees that collect honey from flower to flower. He forgets that before him
is time, which is taking away his life span with the passing of day and
night. He does not see the gradual diminishing of his life, nor does he care
about the superintendent of death, who is trying to kill him from behind.
Just try to understand this. You are in a precarious position and are
threatened from all sides.

PURPORT

Materialistic life means forgetting one’s constitutional position as the
eternal servant of Krsna, and this forgetfulness is especially enhanced in
the grhastha-asrama. In the grhastha-asrama a young man accepts a young
wife who is very beautiful in the beginning, but in due course of time,


--- Page 300 ---
Text 55] Talks Between Narada and King Pracinabarhi 1435
after giving birth to many children and becoming older and older, she
demands many things from the husband to maintain the entire family. At
such a time the wife becomes detestable to the very man who accepted her
in her younger days. One becomes attached to the grhastha-asrama for two
reasons only—the wife cooks palatable dishes for the satisfaction of her
husband’s tongue, and she gives him sexual pleasure at night. A person
attached to the grhastha-asrama is always thinking of these two things—
palatable food and sex enjoyment. The talks of the wife, which are enjoyed
as a family recreation, and the talks of the children both attract the living
entity. He thus forgets that he has to die someday and has to prepare for
the next life if he wants to be put into a congenial body.

The deer in the flower garden is an allegory used by the great sage Narada
to point out to the King that the King himself is similarly entrapped by
such surroundings. Actually everyone is surrounded by such a family life,
which misleads one. The living entity thus forgets that he has to return
home, back to Godhead. He simply becomes entangled in family life.
Prahlada Maharaja has therefore hinted: hitvatma-patam grham andha-
(द्वक! vanarigato yad dharim asrayeta. Family life is considered a blind well
(andha-kiipam) into which a person falls and dies without help. Prahlada
Maharaja recommends that while one’s senses are there and one is
strong enough, he should abandon the grhastha-asrama and take shelter
of the lotus feet of the Lord, going to the forest of Vrndavana. According
to Vedic civilization, one has to give up family life at a certain age (the age
of fifty), take vanaprastha and eventually remain alone as asannyasi. That is
the prescribed method of Vedic civilization known as varnasrama-dharma.
When one takes sannydsa after enjoying family life, he pleases the Supreme
Lord Visnu.

One has to understand one’s position in family or worldly life. That is
called intelligence. One should not remain always trapped in family life to
satisfy his tongue and genitals in association with a wife. In such a way,
one simply spoils his life. According to Vedic civilization, it is imperative
to give up the family at a certain stage, by force if necessary. Unfortunately,
so-called followers of Vedic life do not give up their family even at the end
of life, unless they are forced by death. There should be a thorough over-
hauling of the social system, and society should revert to the Vedic
principles, that is, the four varnas and the four asramas.

PURPORT
In one of his songs, Srila Narottama dasa Thakura writes:

amrta baliya yebd khaya

tara janma adhah-pate yaya
“Fruitive activities and mental speculation are simply cups of poison.
Whoever drinks of them, thinking them to be nectar, must struggle very
hard life after life, in different types of bodies. Such a person eats all kinds
of nonsense and becomes condemned by his activities of so-called sense
enjoyment.”

Text 55] Talks Between Narada and King Pracinabarhi 1437

People are generally enamored of the fruitive results of worldly activity
and mental speculation. They generally desire to be promoted to heavenly
planets, merge into the existence of Brahman, or keep themselves in the
midst of family life, enchanted by the pleasures of the tongue and genitals.
The great sage Narada clearly instructs King Barhisman not to remain his
entire life in the grhastha-asrama. Being in the grhastha-asrama means being
under the control of one’s wife. One has to give up all this and put himself
into the @srama of the paramaharisa, that is, put himself under the control
of the spiritual master. The paramahamsa-asrama is the asrama of the Su-
preme Personality of Godhead, under whom the spiritual master has taken
shelter. The symptoms of the bona fide spiritual master are stated in
Srimad-Bhagavatam:

tasmad guru prapadyeta
Jijidsuh sreya uttamam
sabde pare ca nisnatarn
brahmany upasamasrayam

“Any person who is seriously desirous of achieving real happiness must
seek out a bona fide spiritual master and take shelter of him by initiation.
The qualification of a spiritual master is that he must have realized the con-
clusion of the scriptures by deliberation and arguments and thus be able to
convince others of these conclusions. Such great personalities who have
taken complete shelter of the Supreme Godhead, leaving aside all material
considerations, are to be understood as bona fide spiritual masters.”
(Bhag. 11.3.21)

A paramahamsa is one who has taken shelter of the Parabrahman, the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. If one takes shelter of the paramaharnisa
spiritual master, gradually, through training and instruction, he will become
detached from worldly life and ultimately return home, back to Godhead.
The particular mention of angandsramam asattama-yitha-gatham is very
interesting. The whole world is in the clutches of maya, being controlled
by woman. Not only is one controlled by the woman who is one’s wife,
but one is also controlled by so many sex literatures. That is the cause of
one’s being entangled in the material world. One cannot give up this
abominable association through one’s own effort, but if one takes shelter
of a bona fide spiritual master who is a paramaharisa, he will gradually be
elevated to the platform of spiritual life.

The pleasing words of the Vedas that inspire one to elevate oneself to
theheavenly planets or merge into the existence of the Supreme are for the


--- Page 303 ---
1438 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 29
less intelligent who are described in Bhagavad-gita as mayaydapahrta-jianah
(those whose knowledgeis taken away by the illusory energy). Real knowl-
edge means understanding the miserable condition of material life. One
should take shelter of a bona fide liberated soul, the spiritual master, and
gradually elevate himself to the spiritual platform and thus become detached
from the material world. According to Srila Viévanatha Cakravarti Thakura,
hamsa-$aranam refers to the cottage in which saintly persons live. Generally
asaintly person lives in a remote place in the forest or in a humble cottage.
However, we should note that the times have changed. It may be beneficial
for a saintly person’s own interest to go to the forest and live in a cottage,
but if one becomes a preacher, especially in Western countries, he has to
invite many classes of men who are accustomed to living in comfortable
apartments. Therefore in this age a saintly person has to make proper
arrangements to receive people and attract them to the message of Krsna
consciousness. Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura, perhaps for the
first time, introduced palatial buildings and motor cars for the residence
of saintly persons just to attract the general public in big cities. The main
fact is that one has to associate with a saintly person. In this age people
are not going to search out a saint in the forest, so the saints and sages
have to come to the big cities to make arrangements to receive the people
in general, who are accustomed to the modern amenities of material life.
Gradually such persons will learn that palatial buildings or comfortable
apartments are not at all necessary. The real necessity is to become free
from material bondage in whatever way possible. According to the orders
of Srila Riipa Gosvami:
andsaktasya visayan
yatharham 1.1 101
nirbandhah krsna-sambandhe
yuktar vairagyam ucyate

“When one is not attached to anything, but at the same time accepts
everythingin relation to Krsna, one 15 rightly situated above possessiveness.”
(Bh.r.s. 1.2.255)

One should not be attached to material opulence, but material opulence
may be accepted in the Krsna consciousness movement to facilitate the
propagation of the movement. In other words, material opulence may be
accepted as yukta-vairagya, that is, for renunciation.

did not know this confidential knowledge. If they were aware of it, why
did they not explain it to me?
PURPORT
Actually the so-called teachers or leaders of material society do not
really know the goal of life. They are described in Bhagavad-gita as
mayayapahrta-jiianah. They appear to be very learned scholars, but actually
the influence of the illusory energy has taken away their knowledge. Real
knowledge means searching out Krsna.

“I am seated in everyone’s heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowl-
edge and forgetfulness. By all the Vedas, I am to be known; indeed, I am
the compiler of Vedanta, and I am the knower of the Vedas.” (Bg. 15.15)

All Vedic knowledge is meant for searching out Krsna because Krsna is
the origin of everything. Janmady asya yatah. In Bhagavad-gita Krsna says:

na me viduh sura-ganah
prabhavari na maharsayah
aham adir hi devanam
maharsinam ca sarvasah

“Neither the hosts of demigods nor the great sages know My origin, for, in
every respect, I am the source of the demigods and the sages.” (Bg. 10.2)

Krsna is the origin and beginning of all demigods, including Lord Brahma,
Lord Siva and all others. The Vedic ritualistic ceremonies are concerned
with satisfying different demigods, but unless one is very advanced, he
cannot understand that the original personality is Sri Krsna. Govindam
adi-purusam tam aham bhajami. After hearing the instructions of Narada,
King Barhisman came to his senses. The real goal of life is to attain de-
votional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The King there-
fore decided to reject the so-called priestly orders that simply engage
their followers in the ritualistic ceremonies without giving effective instruc-
tions about the goal of life. At the present moment the churches, temples
and mosques all over the world are not attracting people because foolish
priests cannot elevate their followers to the platform of knowledge. Not
being aware of the real goal of life, they simply keep their congregation in
ignorance. Consequently those who are well educated have become un-
interested in the ritualistic ceremonies. At the same time, they are not
benefited with real knowledge. This Krsna consciousness movement is
therefore very important for the enlightenment of all classes. Following in
the footsteps of Maharaja Barhisman, everyone should take advantage of
this Krsna consciousness movement and abandon the stereotyped ritualistic
ceremonies that go under the garb of so many religions. The Gosvamis
from the very beginning differed from the priestly class that was engaged
in ritualistic ceremonies. Indeed, Srila Sanatana Gosvami compiled his Hari-
bhakti-vilasa for the guidance of the Vaignavas. The Vaisnavas, not caring
for the lifeless activities of the priestly classes, take to full Krsna con-
sciousness and become perfect in this very life. That is described in the
previous verse as paramharisa-saranam, taking shelter of the paramharisa,
the liberated soul, and becoming successful in this life.

TRANSLATION

My dear brahmana, there are contradictions between your instructions
and those of my spiritual teachers who engaged me in fruitive activities. I
now can understand the distinction between devotional service, knowledge
and renunciation. I had some doubts about them, but you have now very
kindly dissipated all these doubts. I can now understand how even the
great sages are bewildered by the real purpose of life. Of course, there is
no question of sense gratification.

PURPORT

King Barhisman was engaged in different types of sacrifice for elevation
to the heavenly planets. People generally are attracted by these activities,
and very rarely is a person attracted to devotional service, as Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu confirms. Unless one is very very fortunate, he does not take
to devotional service. Even the so-called learned Vedic scholars are be-
wildered by devotional service. They are generally attracted to the rituals
for sense gratification. In devotional service there is no sense gratification
but only transcendental loving service to the Lord. Consequently the so-
called priests engaged in sense gratification do not very much like devotion-
al service. The brahmanas, the priests, have been against this Krsna con-
sciousness movement since it began with Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu. When
Caitanya Mahaprabhu started this movement, the priestly class lodged
complaints to the Kazi, the magistrate of the Mohammedan government.
Caitanya Mahaprabhu had to lead a civil disobedience movement against

the propaganda of the so-called followers of Vedic principles. These people
are described as karma-jada-smartas, which indicates that they are priests
engaged in ritualistic ceremonies. It is here stated that such people become
bewildered (rsayo ’pi hi muhyanti). To save oneself from the hands of
these karma-jada-smartas, one should strictly follow the instructions of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead.

A person generally does not know how one body is linked with another
body. How is it possible that one suffers or enjoys the results of activities
in this body in yet another body in the next life. This is a question the
King wants Narada Muni to answer. How may one have a human body in
this life and not have a human body in the next? Even great philosophers

and scientists cannot account for the transferral of karma from one body
to another. As we experience, every individual soul has an individual body,
and one person’s activities, or one body’s activities, are not enjoyed or
suffered by another body or another person. The question is how the
activities of one body are suffered or enjoyed in the next.

TRANSLATION

The expert knowers of the Vedic conclusions say that one enjoys or
suffers the results of his past activities. But practically it is seen that the
body that performed the work in the last birth is already lost. So how is it
possible to enjoy or suffer the reactions of that work in a different body?

PURPORT

Atheists want evidence for the resultant actions of past activities. There-
fore they ask, “Where is the proof that I am suffering and enjoying the
resultant actions of past karma?” They have no idea how the subtle body
carries the results of the present body’s actions down to the next gross
body. The present body may be finished grossly, but the subtle body is
not finished; it carries the soul to the next body. Actually the gross body
is dependent on the subtle body. Therefore the next gross body must
suffer and enjoy according to the subtle body. The soul is carried by the
subtle body continuously until liberated from gross material bondage.

The living entity has two kinds of body—the subtle body and the gross
body. Actually he enjoys through the subtle body, which is composed of
mind, intelligence and ego. The gross body is the instrumental outer
covering. When the gross body is lost, or when it dies, the root of the
gross body—the mind, intelligence and ego—continue and bring about
another gross body. Although the gross bodies apparently change, the real
root of the gross body—the subtle body of mind, intelligence and ego—is
always there. The subtle body’s activities—be they pious or impious—create
another situation for the living entity to enjoy or suffer in the next gross
body. Thus the subtle body continues whereas the gross bodies change
one after another.
Since modern scientists and philosophers are too materialistic, and since
their knowledge is taken away by the illusory energy, they cannot explain


--- Page 310 ---
Text 61] Talks Between Narada and King Pracinabarhi 1445
how the gross body is changing. The materialistic philosopher Darwin has
tried to study the changes of the gross body, but because he had no
knowledge of either the subtle body or the soul, he could not clearly
explain how the evolutionary process is going on. One may change the
gross body, but he works in the subtle body. People cannot understand the
activities of the subtle body, and consequently they are bewildered as to
how the actions of one gross body affect another gross body. The activities
of the subtle body are also guided by the Supersoul, as explained in
Bhagavad-gita:
sarvasya caham hrdi sannivisto
mattah smyrtir jianam apohanam ca
vedai$ ca sarvair aham eva vedyo
vedanta-krd veda-vid eva caham

“I am seated in everyone’s heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowl-
edge and forgetfulness. By all the 16005, 1] am to be known; indeed I am
the compiler of Vedanta, and I am the knower of the Vedas.” (Bg. 15.15)

Because the Supreme Personality of Godhead as Supersoul is always
guiding the individual soul, the individual soul always knows how to act
according to the reactions of his past karma. In other words, the Supersoul
reminds him to act in such a way. Therefore although there is apparently
a change in the gross body, there is a continuation between the lives of an
individual soul.

1446 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 29
TRANSLATION

The living entity, while dreaming, gives up the actual living body.
Through the activities of his mind and intelligence, he acts in another
body, either as a god or a dog. After giving up this gross body, the living
entity enters either an animal body or a demigod’s body on this planet or
on another planet. He thus enjoys the results of the actions of his past life.

PURPORT

Although the root of distress and happiness is the mind, intelligence and
ego, a gross body is still required as an instrument for enjoyment. The
gross body may change, but the subtle body continues to act. Unless the
living entity gets another gross body, he will have to continue in a subtle
body, or a ghostly body. One becomes a ghost when the subtle body acts
without the help of the instrumental gross body. As stated in this verse,
Saydanam imam utsyrjya $vasantam. The gross body may lie on a bed and rest,
and even though the machinery of the gross body is working, the living
entity may leave, go into a dream, and return to the gross body. When he
returns to the body, he forgets his dream. Similarly, when the living entity
takes on another gross body, he forgets the present gross body. The con-
clusion is that the subtle body—mind, intelligence and ego—creates an
atmosphere with desires and ambitions that the living entity enjoys in the
subtle body. Actually the living entity is in the subtle body, even though
the gross body apparently changes and even though he inhabits the gross
body on various planets. All the activities performed by the living entity in
the subtle body are called illusory because they are not permanent. Libera-
tion means getting out of the clutches of the subtle body. Liberation from
the gross body simply involves the transmigration of the soul from one
gross body to another. When the mind is educated in Krsna consciousness,
or higher consciousness in the mode of goodness, one is transferred either
to the upper heavenly planets or to the spiritual world, the Vaikuntha
planets. One therefore has to change his consciousness by cultivating
knowledge received from Vedic instructions from the Supreme Personality
of Godhead through the disciplic succession. If we train the subtle body in
this life by always thinking about Krsna, we will transfer to Krsnaloka after
leaving the gross body. This is confirmed by the Supreme Personality of
Godhead.

“One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities
does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world,
but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.” (Bg. 4.9)

Thus the change of the gross body is not very important, but the change
of the subtle body is important. The Krsna consciousness movement is
educating people to enlighten the subtle body. The perfect example in this
regard is Ambarisa Maharaja, who always engaged his mind on the lotus
feet of Lord Krsna. Sa vai manah krsna-padaravindayoh. Similarly, in this
life we should always fix our mind on the lotus feet of Krsna, whois present
in His arcd-vigraha, the incarnation of the Deity in the temple. We should
also always engage in His worship. If we engage our speech in describing
the activities of the Lord and our ears in hearing about His pastimes, and if
we follow the regulative principles to keep the mind intact for advancing in
Krsna consciousness, we shall certainly be elevated to the spiritual platform.
Then at the time of death the mind, intelligence and ego will no longer be
materially contaminated. The living entity is present, and the mind, intelli-
gence and ego are also present. When the mind, intelligence and ego are
purified, all the active senses of the living entity become spiritual. Thus the
living entity attains his sac-cid-ananda-vigraha form. The Supreme Lord is
always in His sac-cid-ananda-vigraha form, but the living entity, although
part and parcel of the Lord, becomes materially contaminated when he
desires to come to the material world for material enjoyment. The prescrip-
tion for returning home, back to Godhead, is given by the Lord Himself
in Bhagavad-gita:

man-mana bhava mad-bhakto
mad-yaji mam namaskuru
mam evaisyasi yuktvaivam
dtmanari mat-parayanah
“Always think of Me and become My devotee. Worship Me and offer your
homage unto Me. Being completely absorbed in Me, surely you will come
to Me.” (Bg. 9.34)

TRANSLATION

The living entity labors under the bodily conception of “I am this, I am
that. My duty is this, and therefore I shall do it.” These are all mental
impressions, and all these activities are temporary; nonetheless, by the grace
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the living entity gets a chance to
execute all his mental concoctions. Thus he gets another body.

PURPORT

As long as one is absorbed in the bodily conception, his activities are
performed on that platform. This is not very difficult to understand. In
the world, we see that every nation is trying to supersede every other nation
and that every man is trying to advance beyond his fellow man. All these
activities are going on under the name of advancement of civilization.
There are many plans for making the body comfortable, and these plans
are carried in the subtle body after the destruction of the gross body. It is
not a fact that after the gross body is destroyed the living entity is finished.
Although many great philosophers and teachers in this world are under the
impression that after the body is finished everything is finished, this is not
a fact. Narada Muni says in this verse that at death one takes his plans with
him (grhpiyat), and to execute these plans he gets another body. This is
called punar bhavah. When the gross body is finished, the plans of the living
entity are taken by the mind, and, by the grace of the Lord, the living
entity gets a chance to give these plans shape in the next life. This is known
as the law of karma. As long as the mind is absorbed in the laws of karma,
a certain type of body must be accepted in the next life.

Karma is the aggregate of fruitive activities conducted to make this body
comfortable or uncomfortable. We have actually seen that when one man
was about to die he requested his physician to give him a chance to live
four more years so that he could finish his plans. This means that while
dying he was thinking of his plans. After his body was destroyed, he
doubtlessly carried his plans with him by means of the subtle body com-


--- Page 314 ---

posed of mind, intelligence and ego. Thus he would get another chance by
the grace of the Supreme Lord, the Supersoul, who is always within the
heart.
sarvasya caharm hrdi sannivisto

“I am seated in everyone’s heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowl-
edge and forgetfulness. By all the Vedas, I am to be known; indeed I am
the compiler of Vedanta, and I am the knower of the Vedas.” (Bg. 15.15)

In the next birth, one acquires remembrance from the Supersoul and
begins to execute the plansbegun in the previous life. This is also explained
in Bhagavad-gita in another verse:

iSvarah sarva-bhitanam
hrd-dese ’rjuna tisthati
bhramayan sarva-bhiitani
yantraridhani mayaya
“The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone’s heart, O Arjuna, and is directing
the wanderings of all living entities, who are seated as on a machine, made
of the material energy.” (Bg. 18.61)

Situated on the vehicle given by material nature and reminded by the
Supersoul within the heart, the living entity struggles all over the universe
to fulfill his plans, thinking, “I am a brahmanpa, 1 am a ksatriya. ] am an
American, I am an Indian,” and so on. All these designations are of the
same essence. There is no point in becoming a brahmana in preference to
an American or becoming an American in preference to a Negro. After all,
these are all bodily conceptions under the modes of material nature.

TRANSLATION

One can understand the mental or conscious position of a living entity
by the activities of two kinds of senses—the knowledge-acquiring senses
and the executive senses. Similarly, by the mental condition or conscious-
ness of a person, one can understand his position in the previous life.

PURPORT

There is an English proverb that says, “The face is the index of the mind.”
If one is angry, his anger is immediately expressed in his face. Similarly,
other mental states are reflected by the actions of the gross body. In other
words, the activities of the gross body are reactions of the mental condi-
tion. The mind’s activities are thinking, feeling and willing. The willing
portion of the mind is manifest by the activities of the body. The conclu-
sion is that by the activities of the body and senses, we can understand the
condition of the mind. The condition of the mind is affected by past
activities in the past body. When the mind is joined with a particular sense,
it immediately becomes manifest in a certain way. For instance, when
there is anger in the mind, the tongue vibrates so many maledictions.
Similarly, when the mind’s anger is expressed through the hand, there is
fighting. When it is expressed through the leg, there is kicking. There are
so many ways in which the subtle activities of the mind are expressed
through the various senses. The mind of a person in Krsna consciousness
also acts in a similar way. The tongue chants Hare Krsna, the maha-mantra,
the hands are raised in ecstasy, and the legs dance in Krsna consciousness.
These symptoms are technically called asta-sattvika-vikara. This is trans-
formation of the mental condition in goodness or sometimes transcendental
ecstasy.

TRANSLATION
Sometimes we suddenly experience something that was never experienced
in the present body by sight or hearing. Sometimes we see such things
suddenly in dreams.
PURPORT
We sometimes see things in dreams that we have never experienced in
the present body. Sometimes in dreams we think that we are flying in the
sky, although we have no experience of flying. This means that once in a
previous life, either as a demigod or astronaut, we flew in the sky. The
impression is there in the stockpile of the mind, and it suddenly expresses
itself. It is like fermentation taking place in the depths of water, which
sometimes manifests itself in bubbles on the water’s surface. Sometimes
we dream of coming to a place we have never known or experienced in this
lifetime, but this is proof that in a past life we experienced this. The
impression is kept within the mind and sometimes becomes manifest
either in dream or in thought. The conclusion is that the mind is the
storehouse of various thoughts and experiences undergone during our past
lives. Thus there is a chain of continuation from one life to another, from
previous lives to this life, and from this life to future lives. This is also
sometimes proved by saying that a man is a born poet, a born scientist or
a born devotee. If, like Maharaja Ambarisa, we think of Krsna constantly
in this life (sa vai manah krsnpa-padaravindayoh), we will certainly be
transferred to the kingdom of God at the time of death. Even if our at-
tempt to be Krsna conscious is not complete, our Krsna consciousness will
continue in the next life. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita:
prapya punya-krtam lokan

If we rigidly follow the principles of meditation on Krsna, there is no
doubt that in our next life we will be transferred to Krgnaloka, Goloka
Vrndavana.

(Prema-vivarta 6.2)

Actually the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, is the supreme
enjoyer. When a living entity wants to imitate Him, he is given a chance to
satisfy his false desire to lord it over material nature. That is the beginning


--- Page 318 ---
Text 65] Talks Between Narada and King Pracinabarhi 1453
of his downfall. As long as he is within this material atmosphere, he has a
subtle vehicle in the form of the mind, which is the stockpile of all kinds
of material desires. Such desires become manifest in different bodily forms.
Srila Narada Muni requests the King to accept this fact from him because
he is an authority. The conclusion is that the mind is the storehouse of our
past desires, and we have this present body due to our past desires. Simi-
larly, whatever we desire in this present body will be expressed in a future
body. Thus the mind is the source of different kinds of bodies.

If the mind is purified by Krsna consciousness, one will naturally in the
future get a body that is spiritual and full of Krsna consciousness. Such a
body is our original form, as Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu confirms: jivera
‘svaripa’ haya——krsnera ‘nitya-dasa’. “Every living entity is constitu-
tionally an eternal servant of Krsna.” If a person is engaged in the devo-
tional service of the Lord, he is to be considered a liberated soul even in
this life. This is confirmed by Srila Riipa Gosvami:

iha yasya harer dasye
1007771011৫ manasa gira
nikhilasv apy avasthasu
jivan-muktah sa ucyate
“One who engages in the transcendental service of the Lord in body, mind,
and word is to be considered liberated in all conditions of material
existence.” (Bh.r.s. 1.2.187) The Krsna consciousness movement is based
on this principle. We must teach people to absorb themselves always in
the service of the Lord because that position is their natural position. One
who is always serving the Lord is to be considered already liberated. This
is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita:
mar ca yo ‘vyabhicarena
bhakti-yogena sevate
sa gunan samatityaitan
brahma-bhiiyaya kalpate
“One who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any
circumstance, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus
comes to the level of Brahman.” (Bg. 14.26)

The devotee is therefore above the three modes of material nature and
is even transcendental to the brédhmana platform. A brahmapa may be
infected by the two baser modes—namely rajo-guna and tamo-guna. A pure


--- Page 319 ---
1454 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 29
devotee, who is free from all material desires experienced on the mental
platform and who is also free from empiric philosophical speculation or
fruitive activity, is always above material conditioning and is always
liberated.

TRANSLATION
O King, all good fortune unto you! The mind is the cause of the living
entity’s attaining a certain type of body in accordance with his association
with material nature. According to one’s mental composition, one can
understand what the living entity was in his past life as well as what kind
of body he will have in the future. Thus the mind indicates the past and
future bodies.
PURPORT
The mind is the index of information about one’s past and future life.
If a man is a devotee of the Lord, he cultivated devotional service in his
previous life. Similarly, if one’s mind is criminal, he was criminal in his
last life. In the same way, according to the mind, we can understand what
will happen in a future life. In Bhagavad-gita it is said:
ardhvarni gacchanti sattva-stha
madhye tisthanti rajasah
Jjaghanya-guna-vrtti-stha
adho gacchanti tamasah
“Those situated in the mode of goodness gradually go upward to the
higher planets; those in the mode of passion live on the earthly planets;


--- Page 320 ---
Text 67] Talks Between Narada and King Pracinabarhi 1455
and those in the mode of ignorance go down to the hellish worlds.”
(Bg. 14.18)

If a person is in the mode of goodness, his mental activities will promote
him to a higher planetary system. Similarly, if he has a low mentality, his
future life will be most abominable. The lives of the living entity, in both
the past and the future, are indicated by the mental condition. Narada Muni
is herein offering the King blessings of all good fortune so that the King
will not desire anything or make plans for sense gratification. The King
was engaged in fruitive ritualistic ceremonies because he hoped to get a
better life in the future. Narada Muni desired him to give up all mental
concoctions. As explained before, all bodies in heavenly planets and hellish
planets arise from mental concoctions, and the sufferings and enjoyments
of material life are simply on the mental platform. They take place on the
chariot of the mind (mano-ratha). It is therefore said:

yasyasti bhaktir bhagavaty akificana
sarvair gunais tatra samdsate surah
harav abhaktasya kuto mahad-guna
mano-rathenasati dhdavato bahih
“One who has unflinching devotion for the Personality of Godhead has all
the good qualities of the demigods. But one who is not a devotee of the
Lord has only material qualifications that are of little value. This is because
he is hovering on the mental plane and is certain to be attracted by the
glaring material energy.” (Bhag. 5.18.12)

Unless one becomes a devotee of the Lord or becomes fully Krsna con-
scious, he will certainly hover on the mental platform and be promoted and
degraded in different types of bodies. All qualities that are considered
good according to the material estimation actually have no value because
these so-called good qualities will not save a person from the cycle of birth
and death. The conclusion is that one should be without mental desire.
Anyabhilasita-sinyam jiana-karmady-anavrtam: one should be fully free
from material desires, philosophical speculation and fruitive activity. The
best course for a human being is to favorably accept the transcendental
devotional service of the Lord. That is the highest perfection of human life.

Sometimes in a dream we see something never experienced or heard of

PURPORT
In the previous verse it was explained that in dreams we see that which
was experienced during the day. But why is it that we sometimes in our
dreams see what we have never heard of or seen at any time during this
life? Here it is stated that even though such events may not be experienced
in this life, they were experienced in previous lives. According to time and
circumstance, they combine so that in dreams we see something wonderful
that we have never experienced. For instance, we may see an ocean on the
peak of a mountain. Or we may see that the ocean has dried up. These are
simply combinations of different experiences in time and space. Some-
times we may see a golden mountain, and this is due to our having
experienced gold and mountains separately. In the dream, under illusion,
we combine these separate factors. In this way we are able to see golden
mountains or stars during the day. The conclusion is that these are all
mental concoctions, although they have actually been experienced in
different circumstances. They have simply combined together in a dream.
This fact is further explained in the following verse.

TRANSLATION
The mind of the living entity continues to exist in various gross bodies,
and according to one’s desires for sense gratification, the mind records
different thoughts. In the mind these appear together in different combi-
nations; therefore these images sometimes appear as things never seen or
never heard.
PURPORT
The activities of the living entity in the body of a dog may be experienced
in the mind of a different body; therefore those activities appear never to
have been heard or seen. The mind continues, although the body changes.
Even in this lifespan we can sometimes experience dreams of our child-
hood. Although such incidents now appear strange, it is to be understood
that they are recorded in the mind. Because of this, they become visible
in dreams. The transmigration of the soul is caused by the subtle body,
which is the storehouse of all kinds of material desires. Unless one is fully
absorbed in Krsna consciousness, material desires will come and go. That
is the nature of the mind—thinking, feeling and willing. As long as the
mind is not engaged in meditation on the lotus feet of the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead, Krsna, the mind will desire so many material enjoy-
ments. Sensual images are recorded in the mind in chronological order,
and they become manifest one after another; therefore the living entity
has to accept one body after another. The mind plans material enjoyment,
and the gross body serves as the instrument to realize such desires and
plans. The mind is the platform onto which all desires come and go. Srila
Narottama dasa Thakura therefore sings:
guru-mukha-padma-vakya, cittete kariya aikya,

--- Page 323 ---
1458 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 29
Narottama dasa Thakura advises everyone to stick to the principle of
carrying out the orders of the spiritual master. One should not desire any-
thing else. If the regulative principles ordered by the spiritual master are
followed rigidly, the mind will gradually be trained to desire nothing but
the service of Krsna. Such training is the perfection of life.

exactly like the dark planet known as Rahu, which is observed in the
presence of the full moon.
PURPORT
It has been explained in the previous verse that all desires on the mental
platform become visible one after another. Sometimes, however, by the
supreme will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the whole stockpile
can be visible all at one time. In Brahma-samhita it is said, kaermani
nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bhdjam (5.54). When a person is fully absorbed
in Krsna consciousness, his stockpile of material desires is minimized.
Indeed, the desires no longer fructify in the form of gross bodies. Instead,


--- Page 324 ---
Text 70] Talks Between Narada and King Pracinabarhi 1459
the stockpile of desires becomes visible on the mental platform by the
grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

In this connection, the darkness occurring before the full moon, the
lunar eclipse, can be explained as being another planet, known as Rahu.
According to Vedic astronomy, the Rahu planet, which is not visible, is
accepted. Sometimes the Rahu planet is visible in the presence of full
moonlight. It then appears that this Rahu planet exists somewhere near the
orbit of the moon. The failure of modern moon excursionists may be due
to the Rahu planet. In other words, those who are supposed to be going
to the moon may actually be going to this invisible planet Rahu. Actually
they are not going to the moon but to the planet Rahu, and after reaching
this planet, they come back. Apart from this discussion, the point is that
a living entity has immense and unlimited desires for material enjoyment,
and he has to transmigrate from one gross body to another until these
desires are exhausted.

No living entity is free from the cycle of birth and death unless he takes
to Krsna consciousness; therefore in this verse it is clearly stated (sattvaika-
nisthe) that when one is fully absorbed in Krsna consciousness, in one
stroke he is freed of past and future mental desires. Then, by the grace of
the Supreme Lord, everything becomes simultaneously manifest within the
mind. In this regard, Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura cites the example of
mother Yasoda’s seeing the whole cosmic manifestation within the mouth
of Lord Krsna. By the grace of Lord Krsna, mother Yasoda saw all the
universes and planets within the mouth of Krsna. Similarly, by the grace
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, a Krsna conscious person
can see all his dormant desires at one time and finish all his future trans-
migrations. This facility is especially given to the devotee to make his path
clear for returning home, back to Godhead.

Why we see things not experienced in this life is explained herein. That
which we see is the future expression of a gross body or is already stocked
in our mental stockpile. Because a Krsna conscious person does not have
to accept a future gross body, his recorded desires are fulfilled in a dream.
We therefore sometimes find things in a dream never experienced in our
present life.

TRANSLATION
As long as there exists the subtle material body composed of intelligence,
mind, senses, sense objects and the reactions of the material qualities, the
consciousness of false identification and its relative objective, the gross
body, exist as well.
PURPORT
The desires in the subtle body of mind, intelligence and ego cannot be
fulfilled without a gross body composed of the material elements earth,
water, air, fire and ether. When the gross material body is not manifest, the
living entity cannot factually act in the modes of material nature. In this
verse it is clearly explained that the subtle activities of the mind and
intelligence continue due to the sufferings and enjoyments of the living
entity’s subtle body. The consciousness of material identification (such as
“I and mine”) still continues because such consciousness has been extant
from time immemorial. However, when one transfers to the spiritual
world by virtue of understanding Krsna consciousness, the actions and
reactions of both gross and subtle bodies no longer bother the spirit soul.

TRANSLATION

When the living entity is in deep sleep, when he faints, when there is
some great shock on account of severe loss, at the time of death, or when
the body temperature is very high, the movement of the life air is arrested.
At that time the living entity loses knowledge of identifying the body with
the self.

PURPORT

Foolish people deny the existence of the soul, but it is a fact that when
we sleep we forget the identity of the material body and when we awake,
we forget the identity of the subtle body. In other words, while sleeping
we forget the activities of the gross body, and when active in the gross
body we forget the activities of sleeping. Actually both states—sleeping
and waking—are creations of the illusory energy. The living entity actually
has no connection with either the activities of sleep or the activities of the
so-called wakened state. When a person is in deep sleep or when he has
fainted, he forgets his gross body. Similarly, under chloroform or some
other anesthetic, the living entity forgets his gross body and does not
feel pain or pleasure during a surgical operation. Similarly, when a man is
suddenly shocked by some great loss, he forgets his identification with the
gross body. At the time of death, when the temperature of the body rises
to 107 degrees, the living entity falls into a coma and is unable to identify
his gross body. In such cases, the life air that moves within the body is
choked up, and the living entity forgets his identification with the gross
body. Because of our ignorance of the spiritual body, of which we have no
experience, we do not know of the activities of the spiritual body, and, in
ignorance, we jump from one false platform to another. We act sometimes
in relation to the gross body and sometimes in relation to the subtle body.
If, by Krsna’s grace, we act in our spiritual body, we can transcend both
the gross and subtle bodies. In other words, we can gradually train our-
selves to act in terms of the spiritual body. As stated in the Nareda-
paiicaratra, hrsikena hrsikesa-sevanam bhaktir ucyate: devotional service
means engaging the spiritual body and spiritual senses in the service of the
Lord. When we are engaged in such activities, the actions and reactions of
the gross and subtle bodies cease.

TRANSLATION
When one is a youth, all the ten senses and the mind are completely
visible. However, in the mother’s womb or in the boyhood state, the sense
organs and the mind remain covered, just as the full moon is covered by
the darkness of the dark-moon night.
PURPORT
When a living entity is within the womb, his gross body, the ten sense
organs and the mind are not fully developed. At such a time the objects of
the senses do not disturb him. In a dream a young man may experience
the presence of a young woman because at that time the senses are active.
Because of undeveloped senses, a child or boy will not see a young woman
in his dreams. The senses are active in youth even when one dreams, and
although there may be no young woman present, the senses may act and
there may be a seminal discharge (nocturnal emission). The activities of
the subtle and gross bodies depend on how developed conditions are. The
example of the moon is very appropriate. On a dark-moon night, the full shin-
ing moon is still present, but it appears not to be present due to conditions.
Similarly, the senses of the living entity are there, but they only become
active when the gross body and the subtle body are developed. Unless the
senses of the gross body are developed, they will not act on the subtle
body. Similarly, because of the absence of desires in the subtle body, there
may be no development in the gross body.

When the living entity dreams, the sense objects are not actually present.
However, because one has associated with the sense objects, they become
manifest. Similarly, the living entity with undeveloped senses does not
cease to exist materially, even though he may not be exactly in contact
with the sense objects.

PURPORT

It is sometimes said that because a child is innocent he is completely
pure. Actually this is not the fact. The effects of fruitive activities reserved
in the subtle body appear in three concurrent stages. One is called bija
(the root), another is called kiitastha (the desire), and another is called
phalonmukha (about to fructify). The manifest stage is called prarabdha
(already in action). In a conscious or unconscious state, the actions of
the subtle or gross bodies may not be manifest, but such states cannot be
called the liberated state. A child may be innocent, but this does not mean
that he is a liberated soul. Everything is held in reservation, and everything
will become manifest in due course of time. Even in the absence of certain
manifestations in the subtle body, the objects of sense enjoyment may act.
The example has been given of a nocturnal emission in which the physical
senses act even when the physical objects are not manifest. The three
modes of material nature may not be manifest in the subtle body, but the
contamination of the three modes remains conserved, and, in due course
of time, it becomes manifest. Even if the reactions of the subtle and gross


--- Page 329 ---
1464 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 29
bodies are not manifest, one does not become free from the material con-
ditions. Therefore it is wrong to say that a child is asgood as a liberated soul.

The five sense objects, the five sense organs, the five knowledge-acquiring
senses, and the mind are the sixteen material expansions. These combine
with the living entity and are influenced by the three modes of material
nature. Thus the existence of the conditioned soul is understood.

PURPORT
Lord Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita:

jiva-bhiitah sandtanah
manah sasthanindriyani
prakrti-sthani karsati
“The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental
parts. Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six
senses, which include the mind.” (Bg. 15.7)

Here it is also explained that the living entity comes in contact with the
sixteen material elements and is influenced by the three modes of material
nature. The living entity and this combination of elements combine to form
what is called jiva-bhitta, the conditioned soul that struggles hard within

Text 75] Talks Between Narada and King Pracinabarhi 1465
material nature. The total material existence is first agitated by the three
modes of material nature, and these become the living conditions of the
living entity. Thus the subtle and gross bodies develop, and the ingredients
are earth, water, fire, air, sky, and so on. According to Sri Madhvacarya,
when consciousness, the living force in the heart, is agitated by the three
modes of material nature, then the subtle body of the living entity, con-
sisting of the mind, the sense objects, the five senses that acquire knowledge,
and the five senses for acting in the material condition, becomes possible.

TRANSLATION
By virtue of the processes of the subtle body, the living entity develops
and gives up gross bodies. This is known as the transmigration of the soul.
Thus the soul becomes subjected to different types of so-called enjoyment,
lamentation, fear, happiness and unhappiness.
PURPORT
According to this explanation, one can clearly understand that originally
the living entity was as good as the Supreme Personality of Godhead in
his pure spiritual existence. However, when the mind becomes polluted
by desires for sense gratification in the material world, the living entity
drops into the material conditions, as explained in this verse. Thus he
begins his material existence, which means that he transmigrates from one
body to another and becomes more and more entangled in material exist-
ence. The process of Krsna consciousness, by which one always thinks of


--- Page 331 ---
1466 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 29
Krsna, is the transcendental process by which one can revert to his original
spiritual existence. Devotional service means always thinking of Krsna.
man-mana bhava mad-bhakto
mad-yaji mam namaskuru

“Always think of Me and become My devotee. Worship Me and offer your
homage unto Me. Thus you will come to Me without fail. I promise you
this because you are My very dear friend.” (Bg. 18.65)

One should always engage in the Lord’s devotional service. As recom-
mended in the arcana-marga, one should worship the Deity in the temple
and constantly offer obeisances to the spiritual master and the Deity.
These processes are recommended to one who actually wants to become
free from material entanglement. Modern psychologists can study the
actions of the mind—thinking, feeling and willing—but they are unable to
go deep into the matter. This is due to their lack of knowledge and to
their not being associated with a liberated dcarya.

As stated in Bhagavad-gita:

evan parampara-praptam
imam rajarsayo viduh
sa kaleneha mahata
yogo nastah parantapa
“This supreme science was thus received through the chain of disciplic
succession, and the saintly kings understood it in that way. But in course
of time the succession was broken, and therefore the science as it is appears
to be lost.” (Bg. 4.2)

Guided by so-called psychologists and philosophers, people in the modern
age do not know of the activities of the subtle body and thus cannot
understand what is meant by the transmigration of the soul. In these
matters we have to take the authorized statements of Bhagavad-gita:

dehino ’smin yatha dehe
10007707078 yauvanam jara

tatha dehantara-praptir
dhiras tatra na muhyati


--- Page 332 ---
Texts 76-77] Talks Between Narada and King Pracinabarhi 1467
“As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to
youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death.
The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change.” (Bg. 2.13)
Unless all human society understands this important verse in Bhagavad-
gitd, civilization will advance in ignorance, not in knowledge.

TRANSLATION
The caterpillar transports itself from one leaf to another by capturing
one leaf before giving up the other. Similarly, according to his previous
work, the living entity must capture another body before giving up the
one he has. This is because the mind is the reservoir of all kinds of desires.

1468 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 29
PURPORT

A living entity too much absorbed in material activity becomes very
much attracted to the material body. Even at the point of death, he thinks
of his present body and the relatives connected to it. Thus he remains
fully absorbed in the bodily conception of life, so much so that even at
the point of death he abhors leaving his present body. Sometimes it is
found that a person on the verge of death remains in a coma for many
days before giving up the body. This is common among so-called leaders
and politicians who think that without their presence the entire country
and all society will be in chaos. This is called maya. Political leaders do
not like to leave their political posts, and they either have to be shot by an
enemy or obliged to leave by the arrival of death. By superior arrange-
ment a living entity is offered another body, but because of his attraction
to the present body, he does not like to transfer himself to another body.
Thus he is forced to accept another body by the laws of nature.

prakrteh kriyamanani
gunaih karmani sarvasah
ahankara-vimadhatma
kartaham iti manyate
“The bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of
material nature, thinks himself the doer of activities that are in actuality
carried out by nature.” (Bg. 3.27)

Material nature is very strong, and the material modes force one to
accept another body. This force is visible when the living entity trans-
migrates from a superior body to an inferior one. One who acts like a dog:
or hogin the present body will certainly be forced to accept the body of a
dog or hog in the next life. A person may be enjoying the body of a prime
minister or a president, but when he understands that he will be forced to
accept the body of a dog or hog, he chooses not to leave the present
body. Therefore he lies in a coma many days before death. This has been
experienced by many politicians at the time of death. The conclusion is
that the next body is already determined by superior control. The living
entity immediately gives up the present body and enters another. Some-
times in the present body the living entity feels that many of his desires
and imaginations are not fulfilled. Those who are overly attracted to their
life situation are forced to remain in a ghostly body and are not allowed to
accept another gross body. Even in the body of a ghost, they create


--- Page 334 ---
Texts 76-77] Talks Between Narada and King Pracinabarhi 1469
disturbances for neighbors and relatives. The mind is the prime cause of
such a situation. According to one’s mind, different types of bodies are
generated, and one is forced to accept them. As confirmed in Bhagavad-
gita:
yam yar vapi smaran bhavari
tyajaty ante kalevaram
tam tam evaiti kaunteya
sada tad-bhava-bhavitah
“Whatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body, that
state he will attain without fail.” (Bg. 8.6)

Within one’s body and mind, one can think as either a dog or a god, and
the next life is offered to him accordingly. This is explained in Bhagavad-
gita:

purusah prakrti-stho hi
bhuiikte prakrti-jan gunan
1৮৫17011077, guna-sango sya
sad-asad-yoni-janmasu
“The living entity in material nature thus follows the ways of life, enjoying
the three modes of nature. This is due to his association with that material
nature. Thus he meets with good and evil amongst various species.”
(Bg. 13.22)

The living entity may transmigrate to either a superior or inferior body
according to his association with the modes of material nature. If he
associates with the mode of ignorance, he gets the body of an animal or an
inferior man, but if he associates with the mode of goodness or passion, he
gets a body accordingly. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita:

ardhvam gacchanti sattva-stha
madhye tisthanti rajasah
Jjaghanya-guna-vrtti-stha
adho gacchanti tamasah
“Those situated in the mode of goodness gradually go upward to the
higher planets; those in the mode of passion live on the earthly planets;
and those in the mode of ignorance go down to the hellish worlds.”
(Bg. 14.18)

The root cause of one’s association is the mind. This great Krgna con-

sciousness movement is the greatest boon to human society because it is


--- Page 335 ---
1470 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 29
teaching everyone to think always of Krsna by executing devotional service.
In this way, at the end of life, one may be transferred to the association of
Krsna. This is technically called nitya-lila-pravista, entering into the planet
Goloka Vrndavana. Bhagavad-gita explains:
bhaktya mam abhijanati
yavan yas casmi tattvatah
tato mam tattvato jiatva
visate tad-anantaram
“One can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional
service. And when one is in full consciousness of the Supreme Lord by
such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of God.” (Bg. 18.55)

After the mind is completely absorbed in Krsna consciousness, one can
enter the planet known as Goloka Vrndavana. To enter the association of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one has to understand Krsna. The
process of understanding Krsna is devotional service.

After understanding Krsna as He is, one can become eligible to enter
Krsnaloka and associate with Him. The mind is the cause of such an
exalted position. The mind can also get one a body like dogs and hogs. To
absorb the mind always in Krsna consciousness is therefore the greatest
perfection of human life.

As long as we desire to enjoy sense gratification, we create material

activities. When the living entity acts in the material field, he enjoys the


--- Page 336 ---
Text 79] Talks Between Narada and King Pracinabarhi 1471
senses, and while enjoying the senses, he creates another series of material
activities. In this way the living entity becomes entrapped as a conditioned
soul.

PURPORT

While in the subtle body we create many plans to enjoy sense gratifica-
tion. These plans are recorded in the spool of one’s mind as bija, the root
of fruitive activities. In conditional life the living entity creates a series of
bodies one after another, and this is called karma-bandhana. As explained
in Bhagavad-gita:

yajidrthat 10077780120 ’nyatra
loko ’yarn karma-bandhanah
tad-artham karma kaunteya
mukta-sangah samdacara
“Work done as a sacrifice for Visnu has to be performed, otherwise work
binds one to this material world. Therefore, O son of Kunti, perform your
prescribed duties for His satisfaction, and in that way you will always
remain unattached and free from bondage.” (Bg. 3.9)

If we act only for the satisfaction of Visnu, there is no bondage due to
material activity. If we act otherwise, we become entrapped by one ma-
terial activity after another. Under these circumstances, it is to be supposed
that by thinking, feeling and willing, we are creating a series of future
material bodies. In the words of Bhaktivinoda Thakura, anadi karama-
phale, padi’ bhavdrnava-jale. The living entity falls into the ocean of karma-
bandhana as a result of past material activities. Instead of plunging one-
self into the ocean of material activity, one should accept material activity
only to maintain body and soul together. The rest of one’s time should be
devoted to engaging in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. In
this way one can attain relief from the reactions of material activity.

TRANSLATION

You should always know that this cosmic manifestation is created, main-
tained and annihilated by the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Consequently everything within this cosmic manifestation is under the
control of the Lord. To be enlightened by this perfect knowledge, one
should always engage himself in the devotional service of the Lord.

PURPORT

Self-realization, understanding oneself as Brahman or spirit soul, is
very difficult in the material condition. However, if we accept the devotion-
al service of the Lord, the Lord will gradually reveal Himself. In this way
the progressive devotee will gradually realize his spiritual position. We can-
not see anything in the darkness of night, not even our own selves, but
when there is sunshine we can see not only the sun but everything within
the world as well. Lord Krsna explains in the Seventh Chapter of the
Bhagavad-gita:

mayy asakta-manah partha
yogam yufijan mad-asrayah
৫৪017880078 samagram mar
yatha jiidasyasi tac chrnu
“Now hear, O son of Prtha [Arjuna], how by practicing yoga in full
consciousness of Me, with mind attached to Me, you can know Me in full,
free from doubt.” (Bg. 7.1)

When we engage ourselves in the devotional service of the Lord to
become Krsna conscious, we understand not only Krsna but everything
related to Krsna. In other words, through Krsna consciousness we can
understand not only Krsna and the cosmic manifestation but also our
constitutional position. In Krsna consciousness we can understand that
the entire material creation is created by the Supreme Personality of God-
head, maintained by Him, annihilated by Him, and absorbed in Him. We are

TRANSLATION
The great sage Maitreya continued: The supreme devotee, the great
saint Narada, thus explained to King Pracinabarhi the constitutional posi-
tion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the living entity. After
giving an invitation to the King, Narada Muni left to return to Siddhaloka.
PURPORT
Siddhaloka and Brahmaloka are both within the same planetary system.
Brahmaloka is understood to be the highest planet within this universe.
Siddhaloka is considered to be one of the satellites of Brahmaloka. The
inhabitants of Siddhaloka have all the powers of yogic mysticism. From
this verse it appears that the great sage Narada is an inhabitant of Siddha-
loka, although he travels to all the planetary systems. All the residents of
Siddhaloka are spacemen, and they can travel in space without mechanical
help. The residents of Siddhaloka can go from one planet to another
individually by virtue of their yogic perfection. After giving instructions

1474 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 29
to the great King Pracinabarhi, Narada Muni departed and also invited him
to Siddhaloka.

TRANSLATION
In the presence of his ministers, the saintly King Pracinabarhi left orders
for his sons to protect the citizens. He then left home and went off to
undergo austerities in a holy place known as Kapilasrama.
PURPORT
The word praja-sarga is very important in this verse. When the saintly
King Pracinabarhi was induced by the great sage Narada to leave home and
take to the devotional service of the Lord, his sons had not yet returned
from their austerities in the water. However, he did not wait for their
return but simply left messages to the effect that his sons were to protect
the mass of citizens. According to Viraraghava Acarya, such protection
means organizing the citizens into the specific divisions of the four varnas
and four asramas. It was the responsibility of the royal order to see that the
citizens were following the regulative principles of the four varnas (namely
the brahmanas, ksatriyas, vaiSyas and ईद का 25) and the asramas (brahmacarya,
grhastha, vanaprastha and sannyasa). It is very difficult to rule citizens in
a kingdom without organizing this varndsrama-dharma. To rule the mass
of citizens in a state and keep them in a complete progressive order is not
possible simply by passing laws every year in a legislative assembly. The
varnasrama-dharma is essential in a good government. One class of men
(the brahmanas) must be intelligent and brahminically qualified, another


--- Page 340 ---
Text 82] Talks Between Narada and King Pracinabarhi 1475
class must be trained in administrative work (ksatriya), another in mercan-
tile business (vai$ya) and another simply in labor (ईद का). These four classes
of men are already there according to nature, but it is the government’s
duty to see that all four of these classes follow the principles of their
varnas methodically. This is called abhiraksana, or protection.

It is significant that when Maharaja Pracinabarhi was convinced of the
goal of life through the instructions of Narada, he did not wait even a
moment to see his sons return, but left immediately. There were many
things to be done upon the return of his sons, but he simply left them a
message. He knew what his prime duty was. He simply left instructions for
his sons and went off for the purpose of spiritual advancement. This is the
system of Vedic civilization.

Sridhara Svami informs us that Kapilasrama is located at the confluence
of the Ganges and the Bay of Bengal, a place known now as Ganga-sagara.
This place is still famous as a place of pilgrimage, and many millions of
people gather there every year on the day of Makara-sarikranti and take
bath. It is called Kapilasrama because of Lord Kapila’s living there to per-
form His austerities and penances. Lord Kapila propounded the Sarnikhya
system of philosophy.

TRANSLATION

Having undergone austerities and penances at Kapilasrama, King
Pracinabarhi attained full liberation from all material designations. He con-
stantly engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord and


--- Page 341 ---
1476 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 29
attained a spiritual position qualitatively equal to that of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead.

PURPORT

There is special significance in the words tat-samyatam agat. The King
attained the position of possessing the same status or the same form as
that of the Lord. This definitely proves that the Supreme Personality of
Godhead is always a person. In His impersonal feature, He is the rays of
His transcendental body. When a living entity attains spiritual perfection,
he also attains the same type of body, known as sac-cid-ananda-vigraha.
This spiritual body never mixes with the material elements. Although in
conditional life the living entity is surrounded by material elements (earth,
water, fire, air, sky, mind, intelligence and ego), he remains always aloof
from them. In other words, the living entity can be liberated from the
material condition at any moment, provided that he wishes to do so. The
material environment is called maya. According to Krsna:

daivi hy 65৫ gunamayi
mama maya duratyaya
mam eva ye prapadyante
mdyam etar taranti te
“This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material
nature, is difficult to overcome. But those who have surrendered unto Me
can easily cross beyond 10.” (Bg. 7.14)
As soon as the living entity engages in the transcendental loving service
of the Lord, he immediately attains freedom from all material conditions.
mar ca yo ‘vyabhicarena
bhakti-yogena sevate
sa gundn samatityaitan
brahma-bhayaya kalpate
“One who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in
any circumstance, at once transcends the modes of material nature and
thus comes to the level of Brahman.” (Bg. 14.26)

In the material state the living entity is on the jiva-bhiita platform, but
when he renders devotional service to the Lord, he is elevated to the
brahma-bhiita platform. On the brahma-bhiita platform the living entity
is liberated from material bondage, and he engages in the service of the


--- Page 342 ---
Text 83] Talks Between Narada and King Pracinabarhi 1477
Lord. In this verse the word dhira is sometimes read as vira. Actually there
is not very much difference. The word dhira means “sober,” and vira means
“hero.” One who is struggling against maya is a hero, and one who is
sober enough to understand his position is a dhira. Without becoming
sober or heroic, one cannot attain spiritual salvation.

TRANSLATION
My dear Vidura, one who hears this narration concerning the under-
standing of the living entity’s spiritual existence, as described by the great
sage Narada, or who relates it to others, will be liberated from the bodily
conception of life.
PURPORT
This material creation is the spirit soul’s dream. Actually all existence
in the material world is a dream of Maha-Visnu, as the Brahma-sarmhita
describes: yah karanarnava-jale bhajati sma yoga-nidram ananta-jagadanda-
saroma-kipah. This material world is created by the dreaming of Maha-
Visnu. The real factual platform is the spiritual world, but when the spirit
soul wants to imitate the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is put into this
dreamland of material creation. After being in contact with the material
modes of nature, the living entity develops the subtle and gross bodies.
When the living entity is fortunate enough to associate with Sri Narada
Mahamuni or his servants, he is liberated from this dreamland of material
creation and the bodily conception of life.

TRANSLATION
This narration spoken by the great sage Narada is full of the transcenden-
tal fame of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Consequently this
narration, when described, certainly sanctifies this material world. It
purifies the heart of the living entity and helps him attain his spiritual
identity. One who relates this transcendental narration will be liberated
from all material bondage and will no longer have to wander within this
material world.
PURPORT
As indicated in verse 79, Narada Muni advised King Pracinabarhi to take
to devotional service rather than waste time performing ritualistic cere-
monies and fruitive activities. The vivid descriptions of the subtle and
gross bodies in this chapter are most scientific, and because they are given
by the great sage Narada, they are authoritative. Because these narrations
are full of the glory of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they con-
stitute the most effective process for the purification of the mind. As Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu confirmed: ceto-darpane-marjanam. The more we


--- Page 344 ---
Text 85] Talks Between Narada and King Priacinabarhi 1479
talk of Krsna, think of Krsna, and preach for Krsna, the more we become
purified. This means we no longer have to accept a hallucinatory gross and
subtle body but instead attain our spiritual identity. One who tries to
understand this instructive spiritual knowledge is delivered from this
ocean of nescience. The word pdramesthyam is very significant in this
connection. Paramesthyam 15 also called Brahmaloka; it is the planet on
which Lord Brahma lives. The inhabitants of Brahmaloka always discuss
such narrations so that after the annihilation of the material world, they
can be directly transferred to the spiritual world. One who is transferred to
the spiritual world does not have to go up and down within this material
world. Sometimes spiritual activities are also called paramesth yam.

TRANSLATION

The allegory of King Puranijana, described herein according to authority,
was heard by me from my spiritual master, and it is full of spiritual knowl-
edge. If one can understand the purport of this allegory, he will certainly
be relieved from the bodily conception and will clearly understand life
after death. Although one may not understand what transmigration of the
soul actually is, one can fully understand it by studying this narration.

PURPORT

The word striya, meaning “along with the wife,” is significant. The male

and female living together constitute the sum and substance of material


--- Page 345 ---
1480 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 29
existence. The attraction between male and female in this material world
is very strong. In all species of life the attraction between male and female
is the basic principle of existence. The same principle of intermingling is
also in human society but is in a regulative form. Material existence means
living together as male and female and being attracted by one another.
However, when one fully understands spiritual life, his attraction for the
opposite sex is completely vanquished. By such attraction, one becomes
overly attached to this material world. It is a hard knot within the heart.
purmsah striya mithuni-bhavam eta
tayor mitho hrdaya-granthim ahuh
ato grha-ksetra-sutapta-vittair
janasya moho ‘yam aham mameti (Bhag. 5.5.8)
Everyone comes to this material world attracted to sense gratification, and
the hard knot of sense gratification is the attraction between male and
female. By this attraction, one becomes overly attached to the material
world in terms of grha-ksetra-suta-apta-vitta—that is, home, land, children,
friends, money, and so forth. Thus one becomes entangled in the bodily
conception of “I and mine.” However, if one understands the story of
King Purarijana and understands how, by sexual attraction, Puraijana
became a female in his next life, one will also understand the process of
transmigration.
SPECIAL NOTE: According to Vijayadhvaja Tirtha, who belongs to the
Madhvacarya-sampradaya, the first two of the following verses appear after
the forty-fifth verse of this chapter, and the remaining two verses appear
after the seventy-ninth verse.

deha-posane—to maintain the body; asti—there is; prajiié—intelligence;
samayatta—resting on; kah—what; visesah— difference; tada—then; nrnam—

TRANSLATION

A desire to maintain body, wife and children is also observed in animal
society. The animals have full intelligence to manage such affairs. If a
human being is simply advanced in this respect, what is the difference
between him and an animal? One should be very careful to understand
that this human life is attained after many, many births in the evolutionary
process. A learned man who gives up the bodily conception of life, both
gross and subtle, will, by the enlightenment of spiritual knowledge, be-
come a prominent individual spirit soul, as the Supreme Lord is also.

PURPORT

It is said that man is a rational animal, but from this verse we can also
understand that rationality exists even in animal life. Unless there is
rationality, how can an animal maintain its body by working so hard? That
the animals are not rational is untrue; their rationality, however, is not
very advanced. In any case, we cannot deny them rationality. The point is
that one should use one’s reason to understand the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, for that is the perfection of human life.

the self; yadi—if; syat—it becomes; atmanah—of one’s self; bhiiyat— there

TRANSLATION
If a living entity is developed in Krsna consciousness and is merciful to
others, and if his spiritual knowledge of self-realization is perfect, he will
immediately attain liberation from the bondage of material existence.
PURPORT
In this verse the word daya jivesu, meaning mercy to other living entities,
indicates that a living entity must be merciful to other living entities if he
wishes to make progress in self-realization. This means he must preach
this knowledge after perfecting himself and understanding his own posi-
tion as an eternal servant of Krsna. Preaching this is showing real mercy
to living entities. Other types of humanitarian work may be temporarily
beneficial for the body, but because a living entity is spirit soul, ultimately
one can show him real mercy only by revealing knowledge of his spiritual
existence. As Caitanya Mahaprabhu says, jivera ‘svarapa’ haya—
krsnera ‘nitya-dasa’. “Every living entity is constitutionally a servant of
Krsna.” One should know this fact perfectly and should preach it to the
mass of people. If one realizes that he is an eternal servant of Krsna but
does not preach it, his realization is imperfect. Srila Bhaktisiddhanta
Sarasvati Thakura therefore sings, dusta mana, tumi kisera vaispava?
pratisthara tare, nirjanera ghare, tava hari-nama kevala kaitava. “My dear
mind, what kind of Vaignava are you? Simply for false prestige and a material
reputation you are chanting the Hare Krsna mantra in a solitary place.”
In this way people who do not preach are criticized. There are many
Vaignavas in Vrndavana who do not like preaching; they chiefly try to
imitate Haridasa Thakura. The actual result of their so-called chanting in
a secluded place, however, is that they sleep and think of women and
money. Similarly, one who simply engages in temple worship but does not
see to the interests of the mass of people, or cannot recognize devotees,
is called a kanistha-adhikari:
arcayam eva haraye
pujam yah sraddhayehate
na tad-bhaktesu canyesu

(Bhag. 11.2.47).

TRANSLATION

Everything happening within time, which consists of past, present and
future, is merely a dream. That is the secret understanding in all Vedic
literature.

PURPORT

Factually all of material existence is only a dream. Thus there is no
question of past, present or future. Persons who are addicted to karma-
kanda-vicara, which means “working for future happiness through fruitive
activities,” are also dreaming. Similarly, past happiness and present happi-
ness are merely dreams. The actual reality is Krsna and service to Krsna,
which can save us from the clutches of maya, for the Lord says in
Bhagavad-gita (7.14), mam eva ye prapadyante mdayam etam taranti te:
“Those who surrender unto Me can easily cross beyond My illusory energy.”

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fourth Canto, Twenty-
ninth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “Talks Between Narada
and King Pracinabarhi.”’

Vidura inquired from Maitreya: 0 brahmana, you formerly spoke about
the sons of Pracinabarhi and informed me that they satisfied the Supreme
Personality of Godhead by chanting a song composed by Lord Siva. What
did they achieve in this way?
PURPORT
In the beginning, Maitreya 1391 narrated the activities of the sons of
Pracinabarhi. These sons went beside a great lake, which was like an ocean,
and, fortunately finding Lord Siva, they learned how to satisfy the Su-
preme Personality of Godhead by chanting the songs composed by Lord
1485


--- Page 350 ---
1486 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 30
Siva. Now their father’s attachment for fruitive activities was disapproved
by Narada, who therefore kindly instructed Pracinabarhi by telling him
the allegorical story of Purafjana. Now Vidura again wanted to hear about
his sons, and he was especially inquisitive to know what they achieved by
satisfying the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Here the words siddhim
apuh, or “achieved perfection,” are very important. Lord Krsna says in
Bhagavad-gita:
manugsyanarh sahasresu
kascid yatati siddhaye
yatatam api siddhanam
kascin marin vetti tattvatah
“Out of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection,
and of those who have achieved perfection, hardly one knows Me in truth.”
(Bg. 7.3)

Out of many many millions of people, one may be interested in learning
how to attain success in spiritual matters. The supreme success is mentioned
also in Bhagavad-gita:

mam upetya punar janma
duhkhalayam asasvatam
napnuvanti maehatmanah
samsiddhim paramarn gatah
“After attaining Me, the great souls, who are yogis in devotion, never return
to this temporary world, which is full of miseries, because they have attained
the highest perfection.” (Bg. 8.15)

And what is that highest perfection? That is also explained in that
verse. The highest perfection is to return home, back to Godhead, so that
one will not have to return again to this material world and transmigrate
from one body to another in the dream of material existence. By the grace
of Lord Siva, the Pracetas actually attained perfection and returned home,
back to Godhead, after enjoying material facilities to the highest extent.
Maitreya will now narrate that to Vidura.

TRANSLATION

My dear Barhaspatya, what did the sons of King Barhigat, known as the
Pracetas, obtain after meeting Lord Siva, who is very dear to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, the bestower of liberation? Certainly they were
transferred to the spiritual world, but apart from that, what did they obtain
within this material world, either in this life or in other lives?

PURPORT

All types of material happiness are obtained in this life or in the next
life, on this planet or on another. The living entity wanders within this
material universe in so many species of life and so many planetary systems.
The distress and happiness obtained during the span of life are called iha,
and the distress and happiness obtained in the next life are called paratra.

Actually Lord Mahadeva (Siva) is one of the great demigods within this
material world. Generally his blessings bestowed on ordinary people mean
material happiness. The predominating deity of this material world, Durga,
is under the control of Lord Mahadeva, Girisa. Thus Lord Mahadeva can
offer anyone any kind of material happiness. Generally people prefer to
become devotees of Lord Girisa to obtain material happiness, but the
Pracetas met Lord Mahadeva by providential arrangement. Lord Mahadeva
instructed them to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and he
personally offered a prayer. As stated in the previous verse (rudra-gitena),
simply by chanting the prayers offered by Lord Siva to Visnu, the Pracetas
were transferred to the spiritual world. Sometimes devotees desire to enjoy
material happiness also; therefore, by the arrangement of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, the devotee is given a chance to enjoy the material
world before his final entrance into the spiritual world. Sometimes a devotee
is transferred to a heavenly planet, to Janaloka, Maharloka, Tapoloka,


--- Page 352 ---
1488 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 30
Siddhaloka, and so on. However, a pure devotee never aspires for any kind
of material happiness. The pure devotee is consequently transferred
directly to Vaikunpthaloka, which is described here as param. In this verse
Vidura asks Maitreya, the disciple of Brhaspati, about the different achieve-
ments of the Pracetas.

One can offer prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead directly,
but if one repeats the prayers offered by great devotees like Lord Siva and
Lord Brahma, or if one follows in the footsteps of great personalities, one
can please the Supreme Personality of Godhead very easily. For instance,
we sometimes chant this mantra of Brahma-samhita:
cintamani-prakara-sadmasu kalpa-vrksa-
laksavrtesu surabhir abhipalayantam
laksmi-sahasra-$ata-sambhrama-sevyamanam
govindam adi-purusani tam ahani bhajami

Text 4] The Activities of the Pracetas 1489
“I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, the first progenitor, who is tending
the cows, yielding all desires, in abodes built with spiritual gems and sur-
rounded by millions of purpose-trees. He is always served with great
reverence and affection by hundreds of thousands of laksmis, or gopis.”
(Bs. 5.29) Because this prayer was offered by Lord Brahma, we follow him
by reciting this prayer. That is the easiest way to satisfy the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead. The pure devotee never attempts to reach the Supreme
Lord directly. The most important way to worship the Lord is to go through
the disciplic succession of devotees. The prayers offered by Lord Siva to
the Supreme Personality of Godhead were thus repeated by the Pracetas,
who were thus very successful in pleasing the Supreme Lord.

Here the Supreme Personality of Godhead is described as purafijana.
According to Madhvacarya, the living entity is called puraiijana because
he has become an inhabitant of this material world, and, under the influence
of the three modes of material nature, he is forced to live within it. The
Supreme Personality of Godhead creates this material world (pura), and
He also enters within it. Andantara-stha-paramanu-cayantara-stham. The
Lord enters within the heart of the living entity and within the atom;
therefore both the living entity and the Lord are called puraiijana. One
puraitjana, the living entity, is subordinate to the supreme purafijana;
therefore the duty of the subordinate puraiijana is to satisfy the supreme
puraitjana. That is devotional service. Lord Rudra, or Lord Siva, is the
original ৫০৫7৫ of the Vaignava sampradaya called the Rudra-sampradaya.
Rudra-gitena indicates that under the disciplic succession of Lord Rudra,
the Pracetas achieved spiritual success.

TRANSLATION

At the end of ten thousand years of severe austerities performed by the
Pracetas, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, to reward their austerities,
appeared before them in His very pleasing form. This appealed to the
Pracetas and satisfied the labor of their austerities.

PURPORT

Performing ten thousand years of severe austerities does not seem a
happy endeavor. Yet the devotees, the serious students of spiritual life,
undergo such austerities to attain the favor of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. At that time, when the duration of life was very long, people
could undergo severe austerities for thousands of years. It is said that
Valmiki, the author of Ramayana, underwent meditational austerities for
60,000 years. The Supreme Personality of Godhead appreciated the
austerities undergone by the Pracetas, and He finally appeared before them
in a pleasing form. Thus they all became satisfied and forgot the austerities
they underwent. In the material world, if one is successful after hard labor,
he is very pleased. Similarly, the devotee forgets all his labors and austeri-
ties as soon as he contacts the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although
Dhruva Maharaja was only a five-year-old boy, he underwent severe
austerities by eating simply dry foliage, drinking only water and taking
no food. In this way, after six months, he was able to see the Supreme
Personality of Godhead face to face. When he saw the Lord, he forgot all
his austerities and said, svamin krtartho smi: “My dear Lord, I am very
pleased.”

Of course, these austerities were performed in the Satya-yuga, Dvapara-
yuga and Treta-yuga, but not in this age of Kali. In this Kali-yuga, one can
attain the same results simply by chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra.
Because the people of this age are fallen, the Lord is kind enough to give
them the easiest method. Simply by chanting the Hare Krsna mantra, one
can attain the same results. However, as Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu points
out, we are so unfortunate that we are not even attracted to chanting the
mahd@mantra—Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama,
Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.

TRANSLATION

The Personality of Godhead, appearing on the shoulder of Garuda,
seemed like a cloud resting on the summit of the mountain known as
Meru. The transcendental body of the Personality of Godhead was covered
by attractive yellow garments, and His neck was decorated with the jewel
known as Kaustubha-mani. The bodily effulgence of the Lord dissipated all
the darkness of the universe.

PURPORT

As stated in Caitanya-caritamrta, krsna——siirya-sama; mdya haya
andhakara/ yahan krsna, tahan nahi mayara adhikara (Cc. Madhya 22.31).
The Lord isjust like the effulgent sun. Consequently whenever the Supreme
Personality of Godhead is present, there cannot be darkness or ignorance.
Actually this dark universeis illuminated by the sun, but the sun and moon
simply reflect the bodily effulgence of the Supreme Lord. In Bhagavad-gita
the Lord says: ॥

yad aditya-gatanm tejo
10800 bhasayate ’khilam
yac candramasi yac cagnau
tat tejo viddhi mamakam
“The splendor of the sun, which dissipates the darkness of this whole
world, comes from Me. And the splendor of the moon and the splendor
of fire are also from Me.” (Bg. 15.12)

The conclusion is that the origin of all life is the bodily effulgence of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. This 15 also confirmed in Brahma-samhita:
yasya prabha prabhavato jagad-anda-koti. Being illuminated by the bodily
effulgence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, everything is freed
from all darkness.

TRANSLATION
The Lord’s face was very beautiful, and His head was decorated with a
shining helmet and golden ornaments. The helmet was dazzling and was
very beautifully situated on His head. The Lord had eight arms, which each
held a particular weapon. The Lord was surrounded by demigods, great
sages and other associates. These were all engaged in His service. Garuda,
the carrier of the Lord, glorified the Lord with Vedic hymns by flapping
his wings. Garuda appeared to be an inhabitant of the planet known as
Kinnaraloka.
PURPORT
Generally the Vignu form is manifested with four hands holding four
objects (a conchshell, disc, club and lotus flower). However, here Lord
Vignu is described as possessing eight arms with eight kinds of weapons.
According to Viraraghava Acirya, the conchshell and lotus flower are also
accepted as weapons. Since the Lord is the supreme controller, whatever
is in His hand can be considered a weapon. Four hands hold four kinds of
weapons, and the extra four hands hold an arrow, bow, trident and snake.
Sri Viraraghava Acarya describes the eight weapons as $aiikha, cakra, gada,
padma, sarniga, sara, etc. ।

Text 7] The Activities of the Pracetas 1493

A king is always accompanied by his ministers, secretaries and command-
ers, and Lord Visnu is also accompanied by His followers, the demigods,
great sages, saintly persons, and so on. He is never alone. Consequently
there is no question of the Lord’s being impersonal. He is always Himself,
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and His associates are also persons.
From the description given in this verse, Garuda appears to have belonged
to the Kinnara planet. The inhabitants of the Kinnara planet have the same
features as Garuda. Their bodily features are like those of a human being,
but they have wings. The word gite-kirtih indicates that the inhabitants of
Kinnaraloka are very expert in singing the glories of the Lord. In Brahma-
samhita it is said: jagad-anda-koti-kotisv asesa-vasudhadi-vibhiati-bhinnam.
In each and every universe there are different types of planets, and each
planet has distinctive features. On the strength of this verse, we can under-
stand that in Kinnaraloka the inhabitants can fly with their wings. There is
also a planet, known as Siddhaloka, where the inhabitants can fly even
without wings. Thus each and every planet has some distinctive facility.
That is the beauty of the varied creation of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead.

1494 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 30
TRANSLATION

Around the neck of the Personality of Godhead hung a flower garland
that reached to His knees. His eight stout and elongated arms were decorated
with that garland, which challenged the beauty of the goddess of fortune.
With a merciful glance and a voice like thunder, the Lord addressed the
sons of King Pracinabarhisat, who were very much surrendered unto Him.

PURPORT

The word adyah in this verse is very significant. The Supreme Personality
of Godhead is the origin even of Paramatma and Brahman. As confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita:

brahmano hi pratisthaham
amrtasyavyayasya ca
$dsvatasya ca dharmasya
sukhasyaikantikasya ca
“And I am the basis of the impersonal Brahman, which is the constitutional
position of ultimate happiness, and which is immortal, imperishable and
eternal.” (Bg. 14.27)

The Absolute Truth thus begins not with the impersonal Brahman but
with the original Personality of Godhead, Krsna. When Arjuna realized
Krsna’s greatness, he addressed Him in this way:

arjuna uvdca
parariv brahma parariv dhama
pavitram paramari bhavan
purusam $asvatam divyam
adi-devam ajariv vibhum
ahus tvam rsayah sarve
devarsir naradas tatha
asito devalo vydasah
svayari caiva bravisi me
“Arjuna said: You are the Supreme Brahman, the ultimate, the supreme
abode and purifier, the Absolute Truth and the eternal divine person. You
are the primal God, transcendental and original, and You are the unborn
and all-pervading beauty. All the great sages such as Narada, Asita, Devala,
and Vyasa proclaim this of You, and now You Yourself are declaring it to
me.” (Bg. 10.12-13)

Text 8] The Activities of the Pracetas 1495
The Brahma-samhita also says, anadir adir govindah sarva-karepa-
karanam: “The Supreme Lord is not caused by anything [৫7৫08], but He
is the cause of all causes.” The Vedanta-siitra says, janmady asya yatah:
“The Absolute Truth is that from which everything emanates.” The
Absolute Truth is described as adi-purusa. The Absolute Truth is therefore
a person and is not impersonal.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear sons of the King, I
am very much pleased by the friendly relationships amongst you. All of
you are engaged in one occupation—devotional service. I am so pleased
with your mutual friendship that I wish you all good fortune. Now you
may ask a benediction of Me.
PURPORT
Since the sons of King Pracinabarhisat were all united in Krsna con-
sciousness, the Lord was very pleased with them. Each and every one of
the sons of King Pracinabarhisat was an individual soul, but they were
united in offering transcendental service to the Lord. The unity of the
individual souls attempting to satisfy the Supreme Lord or rendering
service to the Lord is real unity. In the material world such unity is not


--- Page 360 ---
1496 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 30
possible. Even though people may officially unite, they all have different
interests. In the United Nations, for instance, all the nations have their
particular national ambitions, and consequently they cannot be united.
Disunity between individual souls is so strong within this material world
that even in a society of Krsna consciousness, members sometimes appear
disunited due to their having different opinions and leaning toward
material things. Actually in Krspa consciousness there cannot be two
opinions. There is only one goal: to serve Krsna to one’s best ability. If
there is some disagreement over service, such disagreement is to be taken
as spiritual. Those who are actually engaged in the service of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead cannot be disunited in any circumstance. This
makes the Supreme Personality of Godhead very happy and willing to
award all kinds of benediction to His devotees, as indicated in this verse.
We can see that the Lord is immediately prepared to award all benedic-
tions to the sons of King Pracinabarhisat.

TRANSLATION
Those who will offer Me the prayers composed by Lord Siva, both in
the morning and in the evening, will be given benedictions by Me. In this
way they can both fulfill their desires and attain good intelligence.
PURPORT
Good intelligence means going back home, back to Godhead. This is
confirmed in Bhagavad-gita:
tesam satata-yuktanam
bhajatam priti-piirvakam
dadami buddhi-yogar tam
yena mam upayanti te
“To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give
the understanding by which they can come to Me.” (Bg. 10.10)

One who offers prayers to the Lord to fulfill his different desires must
know that the highest perfectional fulfillment of desire is to go back home,
back to Godhead. In this verse it is indicated that those who remember the
activities of the Pracetas, the sons of King Pracinabarhigat, will be delivered
and benedicted. So what to speak of the sons of King Pracinabarhigat, who
are directly connected with the Supreme Personality of Godhead? This is
the way of the parampara system. If we follow the @caryas, we attain the
same benefit as our predecessors. If one follows the decisions of Arjuna, he
should be considered to be directly hearing Bhagavad-gita from the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. There is no difference between hearing Bhagavad-
gita directly from the Supreme Lord and following a personality like
Arjuna, who formerly heard Bhagavad-gita directly from the Lord. Some-
times foolish people argue that since Krsna is not present at the moment,


--- Page 362 ---
1498 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 30
one cannot take direct instructions from Him. Such foolish people do not
know that there is no difference between directly hearing Bhagavad-gita
and reading it, as long as one accepts Bhagavad-gita as it is, spoken by the
Lord. However, if one wants to understand Bhagavad-gita by his imperfect
interpretations, one cannot possibly understand the mysteries of Bhagavad-
gita, even though one may be a great scholar according to mundane estima-
tion.

Because you have with pleasure accepted within your hearts the orders

PURPORT
Since every living entity is part and parcel of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, he has small independence. Sometimes unintelligent men ask
why one is put into a miserable condition, even though everyone is under
the control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because of his minute
independence, the living entity can obey or disobey the orders of the
Supreme Lord. If he obeys the Supreme Lord’s orders, he becomes happy.
If he does not, he becomes unhappy. Therefore the living entity creates
his own happiness or unhappiness. The Supreme Lord does not enforce
these on anyone. The Supreme Lord praised the Pracetas because they all
faithfully obeyed the orders of their father. The Lord therefore blessed the
sons of King Pracinabarhisat because they obeyed their father’s orders.

As explained in the next verse, the Pracetas will marry the daughter of
the great sage Kandu. It is suggested that the son’s name will be Visruta
and that he will glorify both his father and mother because of his
good character. In fact, he would be greater than Lord Brahma. The great
politician Canakya said that if there is a good tree within a garden or
forest, its flowers will fill the forest with their fragrance. Similarly, a good
son within a family makes the whole family famous all over the world.
Krsna took birth in the family of the Yadus, and consequently the Yadu
dynasty is famous all over the world.

TRANSLATION

O sons of King Pracinabarhisat, the heavenly society girl named Pramloca
kept the lotus-eyed daughter of Kandu in the care of the forest trees. Then
she went back to the heavenly planet. This daughter was born by the
coupling of the Apsara named Pramloca with the sage Kandu.

PURPORT

Whenever a great sage undergoes severe austerities for material power,
the King of heaven, Indra, becomes very envious. All the demigods have
responsible posts for the management of universal affairs and are very
highly qualified with pious activities. Although they are ordinary living
entities, they are nonetheless able to attain responsible posts, like Lord
Brahma, Indra, Candra and Varuna. Asis the nature of this material world,
the King of heaven, Indra, is very anxious if a great sage undergoes severe
austerities. The whole material world is filled with such envy that everyone
becomes afraid of his neighbors. Every businessman is afraid of his
associates because this material world is the field of activities for all kinds
of envious people who have come here to compete with the opulence of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus Indra was very much afraid of
the severe austerities performed by the great sage Kandu, and he sent
Pramloca to break his vows and austerities. A similar incident took place
in the case of Visvamitra. From other incidents in the $@stras, it appears
that Indra has always been envious. When King Prthu was celebrating
various sacrifices, outdoing Indra, Indra became very envious, and he
disturbed King Prthu’s sacrifice. This has already been discussed in previous
chapters. King Indra became successful in breaking the vow of the great
sage Kandu, who became attracted by the beauty of the heavenly society
girl Pramloca and begot a female child. This child is described herein as
lotus-eyed and very beautiful. Being thus successful in her mission, Pramloca
returned to the heavenly planets, leaving the newborn child to the care of
the trees. Fortunately the trees accepted the child and agreed to raise her.

Thereafter the child, who was left to the care of the trees, began to cry
in hunger. At that time the King of the forest, namely the King of the

of the King of the moon.
PURPORT
Although the Apsara left her child to the care of the trees, the trees
could not take care of the child properly; therefore the trees handed the
child over to the King of the moon. Thus Candra, King of the moon, put
his finger within the mouth of the child to satisfy her hunger.

although a husband can have many wives. In special instances, however,
it is found that a woman has more than one husband. Draupadi, for

instance, was married to all of the five Pandava brothers. Similarly, the
Supreme Personality of Godhead ordered all the sons of Pracinabarhigat to
marry the one girl born of the great sage Kandu and Pramloca. In special
cases, a girl is allowed to marry more than one man, provided she is able
to treat her husbands equally. This is not possible for an ordinary woman.
Only one who is especially qualified can be allowed to marry more than
one husband. In this age of Kali, to find such an equipoised woman is very
difficult. Thus according to scripture, kalau pafica vivarjayet. In this age a
woman is forbidden to marry her husband’s brother. This system is still
practiced in some of the hilly tracts of India. The Lord says: aprthag-
dharma-sileyam bhiiyat patny arpitasaya. With the blessings of the Lord,
all things are possible. The Lord especially benedicted the girl to surrender
equally to all brothers. Aprthag-dharma, meaning occupational duty with-
out difference of purpose, is taught in Bhagavad-gitd. Bhagavad-gita is
divided into three primary divisions—karma-yoga, jiana-yoga, and bhakti-
yoga. The word yoga means acting on behalf of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. As confirmed by Bhagavad-gita:
yajiiarthat karmano ‘nyatra
loko yam karma-bandhanah
tad-artham karma kaunteya
mukta-sangah samdcara

“Work done as a sacrifice for Vignu has to be performed, otherwise work
binds one to this material world. Therefore, 0 son of Kunti, perform your
prescribed duties for His satisfaction, and in that way you will always
remain unattached and free from bondage.” (Bg. 3.9)

One may act according to his own occupational duty just to satisfy the
yajiia-purusa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is called aprthag-
dharma. Different limbs of the body may act in different ways, but the
ultimate objective is to maintain the entire body. Similarly, if we work for
the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we will find that
we satisfy everything. We should follow in the footsteps of the Pracetas,
whose only aim was to satisfy the Supreme Lord. This is called aprthag-
dharma. According to Bhagavad-gita:

sarva-dharman parityajya
mam eka $arapam vraja

ahah tvam sarva-papebhyo
moksayisyami ma Sucah


--- Page 368 ---
1504 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 30
“Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver
you from all sinful reaction. Do not fear.” (Bg. 18.66)

This is the advice of Lord Krsna. Our only aim should be to act in Krsna
consciousness for the satisfaction of the Lord. This is oneness, or aprthag-
dharma.

TRANSLATION

The Lord then blessed all the Pracetas, saying: My dear princes, by My
mercy, you can enjoy all the facilities of this world as well as the heavenly
world. Indeed, you can enjoy all of them without hindrance and with full
strength for one million celestial years.

PURPORT

The duration of life prescribed for the Pracetas by the Supreme Personality
of Godhead is calculated by the time measurements of higher planetary
systems. Our six earth months are said to equal one day (12 hours) in the
higher planetary systems. Thirty days equal one month, and twelve
months equal one year. In this way, for one million years according to the
calculations of the higher planetary system the Pracetas were allowed to
enjoy all kinds of material facilities. Although this lifespan was so long, the
Pracetas were given full bodily strength by the grace of the Lord. In the
material world, if one wants to live for many years, he must endure the
difficulties of old age, invalidity and many other miserable conditions.
The Pracetas, however, were given full bodily strength to enjoy material

Text 18] The Activities of the Pracetas 1505
facilities. This special facility was given to the Pracetas so that they could
continue rendering full devotional service. This will be explained in the
following verse.

nation; @$ayah—your mind; upayasyatha—you will attain; mat-dhama—

existence; atah— thus.

TRANSLATION

Thereafter you will develop unadulterated devotional service unto Me
and be freed from all material contamination. At that time, being com-
pletely unattached to material enjoyment in the so-called heavenly planets
as well as in hellish planets, you will return home, back to Godhead.

PURPORT

By the grace of the Lord, the Pracetas were given special facilities.
Although they could live millions of years to enjoy material facilities, they
still would not be deviated from the transcendental loving service of the
Lord. Being thus fully engaged, the Pracetas would be completely freed
from all material attachment. Material attachment is very strong. During
one lifetime, a materialist engages in acquiring land, money, friends,
society, friendship, love, and so on. He also wants to enjoy the heavenly
planets after the annihilation of the body. If one is engaged in devotional
serivce, however, he becomes unattached to all kinds of material enjoyment
and suffering. In the material world, those who are elevated to the higher
planetary systems are supposed to enjoy all material facilities, whereas
those degraded to lower planetary systems are supposed to live in a hellish
condition. A devotee, however, is transcendental to both heavenly and
hellish conditions. According to Bhagavad-gita, a devotee’s position is
described in this way:


--- Page 370 ---
1506 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 30
mam ca yo 'vyabhicdrena
bhakti-yogena sevate
sa gunan samatityaitan
brahma-bhityaya kalpate
“One who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in
any circumstance, at once transcends the modes of material nature and
thus comes to the level of Brahman.” (Bg. 14.26)

A devotee is always situated on the Brahman platform. He has nothing
to do with material happiness or distress. When one is strongly fixed in
devotional service and free from all material attachment, uncontaminated
by the material modes of nature, he becomes fit to return home, back to
Godhead. Although by special blessing the Pracetas would enjoy material
facilities for millions of years, they would not be attached to them. Thus
at the end of their material enjoyment they would be promoted to the
spiritual world and return to Godhead.

The word pakva-gunasayah has special significance, for it means that by
devotional service one is able to give up the influence of the three modes
of material nature. As long as one is influenced by the modes of material
nature, he cannot return to Godhead. It is clearly explained that all
planets in the material world—beginning from Brahmaloka down to the
hellish planets—are unfit places for a devotee. Padari padari yad vipadari
na tesam. A place where there is danger at every step is certainly not a
comfortable place. The Lord therefore says in Bhagavad-gita:

abrahma-bhuvanal lokah
punar avartino ‘rjuna
mam upetya tu kaunteya
punar janma na vidyate
“From the highest planet in the material world down to the lowest, all are
places of misery wherein repeated birth and death take place. But one who
attains to My abode, O son of Kunti, never take birth again.” (Bg. 8.16)

Thus there is no profit, even if one is promoted to the highest planet in
the material universe, Brahmaloka. However, if one is somehow or other
promoted to the abode of the Lord, he never returns to the material world.

TRANSLATION

Those who are engaged in auspicious activities in devotional service
certainly understand that the ultimate enjoyer or beneficiary of all
activities is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus when one acts, he
offers the results to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and passes life
always engaged in the topics of the Lord. Even though such a person may
be participating in family life, he is not affected by the results of his
actions.

PURPORT

Generally a person living in a family becomes overly attached to fruitive
activity. In other words, he tries to enjoy the results of his activities. A
devotee, however, knows that Krsna is the supreme enjoyer.

bhoktarar yajiia-tapasarn

“The sages, knowing Me as the ultimate purpose of all sacrifices and
austerities, the Supreme Lord of all planets and demigods and the
benefactor and well-wisher of all living entities, attain peace from the
pangs of material miseries.” (Bg. 5.29)

The Supreme Lord is the supreme proprietor; consequently the devotee
does not consider himself the proprietor of any occupation. The devotee
always thinks of the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the proprietor;
therefore the results of his business are offered to the Supreme Lord. One
who thus lives in the material world with his family and children never
becomes affected by the contaminations of the material world. This is
confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (3.9):


--- Page 372 ---
1508 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 30
yajiarthat karmano ’nyatra
loko ’yam karma-bandhanah
tad-arthari karma kaunteya
mukta-sangah samacara
One who tries to enjoy the results of his activities becomes bound by
the results. One who offers the results or profits to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, however, does not become entangled in the
results. This is the secret of success. Generally people take sannydsa to
become free from the reactions of fruitive activity. One who does not re-
ceive the results of his actions but offers them instead to the Supreme Person-
ality of Godhead certainly remains in a liberated condition. In Bhakti-
rasamrta-sindhu, Srila Ripa Gosvami confirms this:
iha yasya harer dasye
karmana manasa gira
nikhilasv apy avasthasu
Jivan-muktah sa ucyate
If one engages himself in the service of the Lord through his life, wealth,
words, intelligence, and everything he possesses, he will always be liberated
in any condition. Such a person is called a jivan-mukta, one who is liberated
during this lifetime. Devoid of Krsna consciousness, those who engage in
material activities simply become more entangled in material bondage.
They have to suffer and enjoy the actions and reactions of all activity.
This Krsna consciousness movement is therefore the greatest boon to
humanity because it keeps one always engaged in Krgpa’s service. The
devotees think of Krsna, act for Krsna, eat for Krsna, sleep for Krspa and
work for Krsna. Thus everything is engaged in the service of Krsna. A total
life in Krsna consciousness saves one from material contamination. As stated
by Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami Maharaja, krsna bhajane yaha haya
anukiila, visaya baliya tyage tahd haya bhiila. If one is so expert that he can
engage everything or dovetail everything in the service of the Lord, to give
up the material world would be a great blunder. One should learn how to
dovetail everything in the service of the Lord, for everything is connected
to Krsna. That 15 the real purpose of life and secret of success. As reiterated
later in the Third Chapter of Bhagavad-gita:
tasmad asaktah satatam
karyam karma samacara


--- Page 373 ---
Text 20] The Activities of the Pracetas 1509
asakto hy dcaran karma
param apnoti [01007005018
“Therefore, without being attached to the fruits of activities, one should
act as a matter of duty; for. by working without attachment, one attains
the Supreme.” (3.19)

The Third Chapter of Bhagavad-gita specifically considers material
activities for the purpose of sense gratification and material activities for
the purpose of satisfying the Supreme Lord. The conclusion is that these
are not one and the same. Material activities for sense gratification are
the cause of material bondage, whereas the very same activities for the
satisfaction of Krsna are the cause of liberation. How the same activity
can be the cause of bondage and liberation can be explained as follows.
One may get indigestion due to eating too many milk preparations—
condensed milk, sweet rice, and so on. But even though there is indiges-
tion or diarrhea, another milk preparation—yogurt mixed with black
pepper and salt—will immediately cure these maladies. In other words,
one milk preparation can cause indigestion and diarrhea, and another
milk preparation can cure them.

If one is placed in material opulence due to the special mercy of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, he should not consider that opulence
a cause for bondage. When a mature devotee is blessed with material
opulence, he does not become affected adversely because he knows how
to employ material opulence in the service of the Lord. There are many
such examples in the history of the world. There were kings like Prthu
Maharaja, Prahlada Maharaja, Janaka, Dhruva, Vaivasvata Manu and
Maharaja Iksvaku. All of these were great kings and were especially favored
by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If a devotee is not mature, the
Supreme Lord will take away all his opulence. This principle is stated by
the Supreme Personality of Godhead: yasyaham anugrhpami harisye
tad-dhanarir sanaih. “My first mercy shown to My devotee is to take away
all his material opulence.” Material opulence detrimental to devotional
service is taken away by the Supreme Lord, whereas a person who is
mature in devotional service is given all material facilities.

TRANSLATION
Always engaging in the activities of devotional service, devotees feel
ever-increasingly fresh and new in all their activities. The all-knower, the
Supersoul within the heart of the devotee, makes everything increasingly
fresh. This is known as the Brahman position by the advocates of the
Absolute Truth. In such a liberated stage [brahma-bhiita], one is never
bewildered. Nor does one lament or become unnecessarily jubilant. This
is due to the brahma-bhiita situation.
PURPORT
A devotee is inspired by the Supersoul within the heart to advance in
devotional service in a variety of ways. The devotee does not feel
hackneyed nor stereotyped, nor does he feel that he is in a stagnant
position. In the material world, if one engages in chanting a material name,
he will feel tired after chanting a few times. However, one can chant the
Hare Krsna maha-mantra all day and night and never feel tired. As chanting
is increased, it will come out new and fresh. Srila Ripa Gosvami said if he
could somehow get millions of ears and tongues, then he could relish
spiritual bliss by chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra. There is really
nothing uninspiring for a highly advanced devotee. In Bhagavad-gita the
Lord says that He is situated in everyone’s heart and that He helps the
living entity forget and remember. By the grace of the Lord, the devotee
gets inspiration.

“To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, 1 give the
understanding by which they can come to Me.” (Bg. 10.10)

As stated (kusala-karmanam), those engaged in auspicious activities in
devotional service are guided by the Supersoul, described in this verse as
jna, one who knows everything past, present and future. The Supersoul
gives instructions to the sincere unalloyed devotee on how he can progress
more and more in approaching the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Srila
Jiva Gosvami in this connection says that the Supersoul, the plenary expan-
sion of the Personality of Godhead, exists in everyone’s heart, but in the
heart of the devotee He reveals Himself as ever increasingly new. Being
inspired by Him, the devotee experiences increased transcendental bliss in
the execution of his devotional service.

all success in life and is the supreme benefactor. He is also the supreme
friend who takes away all miserable conditions experienced by a devotee.
In a faltering voice, due to ecstasy, the Pracetas began to offer prayers.
They were purified by the presence of the Lord, who was before them
face to face.

PURPORT

The Lord is herein described as purusartha-bhajanam (the bestower of
the ultimate goal of life). Whatever success we want in life can be attained
by the mercy of the Lord. Since the Pracetas had already attained the
Lord’s mercy, they were no longer subject to the contamination of the
material modes. The material modes dissipated from them just as the dark-
ness of night immediately dissipates when the sun rises. Because the Lord
appeared before them, naturally all the contaminations of the material
qualities of rajas and tamas completely disappeared. Similarly, when an
unalloyed devotee chants the Hare Krsna maha-mantra, he is also purified
of all material contamination because the name of the Lord and the Lord
are identical. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam:

Srnvatan sva-kathah krsnah
punya-$ravana-kirtanah
hrdy antah-stho hy abhadrani
vidhunoti suhrt satam
“Sri Krsna, the Personality of Godhead, who is the Paramatma [Supersoul]
in everyone’s heart and the benefactor of the truthful devotee, cleanses
desire for material enjoyment from the heart of the devotee who relishes
his messages, which are in themselves virtuous when properly heard and
chanted.” (Bhag. 1.2.17)

The holy name of the Lord is the Lord Himself. If one chants and hears,
he becomes purified. Gradually all material contamination disappears. The
Pracetas were already purified due to the Lord’s presence before them,
and they could therefore offer the proper prayers with folded hands. In
other words, as soon as devotees are engaged in devotional service, they
become transcendental to all material contamination immediately. As con-
firmed in Bhagavad-gita:

man ca yo ‘vyabhicarena

“One who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in

Sometimes the devotees are dissatisfied due to their not seeing the
Supreme Personality of Godhead personally. When the Pracetas saw the
Supreme Lord personally present, their unhappiness vanished.

material senses. We therefore offer You respectful obeisances again and
again.

1514 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 30
PURPORT
The word nirapita, meaning “concluded,” is very significant in this
verse. No one has to conduct research work to find God or make progress
in spiritual knowledge. Everything is conclusively there in the Vedas.
Therefore the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita:
sarvasya cdham hrdi sannivisto
mattah smrtir jianam apohanar ca
vedai$ ca sarvair aham eva vedyo
veddnta-krd veda-vid eva caham
“I am seated in everyone’s heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowl-
edge and forgetfulness. By all the Vedas, I am to be known; indeed, I am
the compiler of Vedanta, and I am the knower of the Vedas.” (Bg. 15.15)
Understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead through the process
of the Vedas is perfect and conclusive. The Vedas state, atah $ri-krsna-
namddi na bhaved grahyam indriyaih: the transcendental names, forms,
qualities, paraphernalia and pastimes of the Lord cannot be understood by
our blunt material senses. Sevonmukhe hi jihvadau svayam eva sphuraty
adah: when a devotee engages his senses favorably in devotional service,
the Lord, through His causeless mercy, reveals Himself to the devotee.
This is the conclusive Vedic process. The Vedas also indicate that simply
by chanting the holy names of the Lord one can without a doubt become
spiritually advanced. We cannot approach the Supreme Personality of
Godhead by the speed of mind or words, but if we stick to devotional
service we can easily and quickly approach Him. In other words, the
Supreme Lord is attracted by devotional service, and He can approach us
more swiftly than we can approach Him with our mental speculation. The
Lord has stated that He is beyond the range of mental speculation and the
speed of thought, yet He can be approached easily by His causeless mercy.
Thus only by His causeless mercy can He be attained. Other methods will
not be effective.

Dear Lord, we beg to offer our obeisances unto You. When the mind is
fixed upon You, the world of duality, although a place for material enjoy-
ment, appears meaningless. Your transcendental form is full of transcen-
dental bliss. We therefore offer our respects unto You. Your appearances
as Lord Brahma, Lord Vispu and Lord Siva are meant for the purpose of
creating, maintaining and annihilating this cosmic manifestation.

PURPORT

A pure devotee whose mind is always engaged in the service of the Lord
can certainly appreciate the impermanence of this material world. Although
such a devotee may be engaged in executing material activities, this stage
is called andsakti. As explained by Srila Ripa Gosvami, andsaktasya visaydn
yatharham upayufijatah. A devotee is always unattached to material
activities because in the liberated stage his mind is always fixed on the
lotus feet of the Lord.

This material world is called dvaita, the world of duality. A devotee
knows very well that everything within this material world is but a
manifestation of the Supreme Lord’s energy. To maintain the three modes
of material nature, the Supreme Lord takes on different forms as Lord
Brahma, Lord Vignu and Lord Siva. Unaffected by the modes of material
nature, the Lord takes on different forms to create, maintain and annihi-
late this cosmic manifestation. The conclusion is that although the pure
devotee appears to engage in material activities in the service of the Lord,
he knows very well that material enjoyment for sense gratification has no
use whatsoever.

TRANSLATION

Dear Lord, we offer our respectful obeisances unto You because Your
existence is completely independent of all material influences. Your
Lordship always takes away the devotee’s miserable conditions, for Your
brain plans how to do so. You live everywhere as Paramatmaj; therefore
You are known as Vasudeva. You also accept Vasudeva as Your father,
and You are celebrated by the name of Krsna. You are so kind that You
always increase the influence of all kinds of devotees.

PURPORT

In the previous verse it has been said (grhita-mayd-guna-vigrahaya) that
the Lord accepts three kinds of bodies (Visnu, Brahma and Siva) for the
purposes of creating, maintaining and annihilating the cosmic manifestation.
The three predominating deities of the material universe (Brahma, Visnu
and Siva) are called guna-avataras. There are many kinds of incarnations of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the first incarnations within this
material world are Brahma, Vispu and Mahesvara (Siva). Out of these
three, Lord Brahma and Lord Siva accept material bodies, but Lord Visnu
does not accept a material body. Lord Visnu is therefore known as
visuddha-sattva. His existence is completely free from the contamination
of the material modes of nature. One should therefore not think that Lord
Visnu is in the same category with Lord Brahma and Siva. The sastras
forbid us to think in this way.

samatvenaiva vikseta
sa pasandi bhaved dhruvam
One who considers Lord Vispu to be in the same category with devas like
Lord Brahma or Lord Siva or who thinks Lord Brahma and Siva to be
equal to Lord Visnu is to be considered as pasandi (a faithless nonbeliever).
Therefore in this verse Lord Visnu is distinguished in the words namo
visuddha-sattvaya. Although a living entity like us, Lord Brahma is exalted
due to his pious activities; therefore he is given the high post of Brahma.
Lord Siva is not actually like a living entity, but he is not the Surpeme
Personality of Godhead. His position is somewhere between Visnu, the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, and Brahma, the living entity. Lord Siva
is therefore explained in Brahma-samhita in this way:
587৫7 yatha dadhi vikara-visesa-yogat
safijayate na hi tatah prthag asti hetoh
yah Sambhutam api tatha samupaiti karyad
govindam adi-purusam tam ahari bhajami
Lord Siva is considered to be like yogurt (dadhi). Yogurt is nothing but
transformed milk; nonetheless yogurt cannot be accepted as milk.
Similarly, Lord Siva holds almost all the powers of Lord Visnu, and he is
also above the qualities of the living entity, but he is not exactly like
Visnu, just as yogurt, although transformed milk, is not exactly like milk.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is also described herein as
vasudevaya krsnaya. Krsna is the original Supreme Personality of God-
head, and all Visnu expansions are His plenary portions or portions of
His plenary portions (known as svarisa and kala). The svamsa, or direct
expansion, is also called amsa. All vispu-tattvas are 5४270254, direct parts
and parcels of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna. Krsna is known
as Vasudeva because He appeared in this material world as the son of
Vasudeva. Similarly, He is known as Devaki-nandana, Yasoda-nandana,
Nanda-nandana, and so on.

Again and again the Lord is very much interested in increasing the
influence of His devotees. Therefore He is described herein as prabhave
sarva-satvatam. The satvata community is a community of Vaisnavas, pure
devotees of the Lord. The Supreme Personality of Godhead has unlimited
powers, and He wants to see that His devotees are also entrusted with
unlimited powers. A devotee of the Lord is always, therefore, distinguished
from all other living entities.

1518 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 30
The word hari means “One who takes away all miserable conditions,”
and hari-medhase means that the Lord is always planning ways to deliver the
conditioned soul from the clutches of maya. The Lord is so kind that He
personally incarnates to deliver the conditioned souls, and whenever He
comes, He makes His plans.
paritranaya sadhinam

“To deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to
reestablish the principles of religion, I advent Myself millennium after
millennium.” (Bg. 4.8)

Since the Lord delivers all conditioned souls from the clutches of maya,
He is known as hari-medhah. In the list of incarnations, Krsna 15 described
as the supreme and original Personality of Godhead.

Krsna, the original personality of Godhead, appears in this material world
when the demigods, who are devotees of the Lord, are disturbed by the
demons.

TRANSLATION
Dear Lord, we offer our respectful obeisances unto You because from
Your abdomen sprouts the lotus flower, the origin of all living entities.
You are always decorated with a lotus garland, and Your feet resemble the
lotus flower with all its fragrance. Your eyes are also like the petals of a
lotus flower. Therefore we always offer our respectful obeisances unto
You.
PURPORT
The word kamala-nabhaya indicates that Lord Vignu is the origin of the
material creation. From the abdomen of Garbhodakasayi Vispu, a lotus
flower sprouts. Lord Brahma, the first creature of the universe, is born
from this lotus flower, and, subsequently, Lord Brahma creates the whole
universe. The origin of all creation is therefore Lord Visnu, and the origin
of all the vispu-tattvas is Lord Krsna. Consequently Krsna is the origin of
everything. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita:
ahari sarvasya prabhavo
mattah sarvam pravartate
iti matva bhajante mam
budha bhava-samanvitah
“I am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates
from Me. The wise who perfectly know this engage in My devotional
service and worship Me with all their hearts.” (Bg. 10.8) Lord Krsna says:
“I am the origin of everything.” Therefore whatever we see emanates from
Him. This is also confirmed in the Vedanta-siitra. Janmady asya yatah: “The
Absolute Truth is He from whom everything emanates.”

TRANSLATION

Dear Lord, the garment You have put on is yellowish in color like the
saffron of alotus flower, but it is not made of anything material. Since You
live in everyone's heart, You are the direct witness of all the activities of all
living entities. We offer our respectful obeisances unto You again and again.

PURPORT

In this verse the dress of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His
all-pervasive nature are described. The Lord puts on a dress that is yellow,
but such a garment is never to be considered material. The garments of the
Lord are also the Lord. They are nondifferent from the Lord because they
are spiritual in nature.

The word sarva-bhiita-nivasaya further clarifies how Lord Vignu lives in
everyone’s heart and acts as the direct witness of all the activities of the
conditioned soul. Within this material world the conditioned soul has
desires and acts in accordance with these desires. All these acts are observed
by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is also confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita:

sarvasya cahari hrdi sannivisto

mattah smrtir jidnam apohanari ca
“I am seated in everyone's heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowl-
edge and forgetfulness.” (Bg. 15.15) The Lord is present in everyone’s
heart, and He gives the living entity intelligence. According to the desires
of the living entity, the Lord makes him remember or forget. If the living
entity is demoniac and wants to forget the Supreme Personality of God-
head, the Lord gives him the intelligence to be able to forget the Supreme
Lord forever. Similarly, when a devotee wants to serve the Supreme Lord,
the Lord, as Paramatma, gives the devotee the intelligence to make progress
in devotional service. The Lord directly witnesses our activities and ex-
periences our desires. The Supreme Lord gives us the facilities to act in the
way we wish.

TRANSLATION
Dear Lord, we conditioned souls are always covered by ignorance in the
bodily conception of life. We therefore always prefer the miserable condi-
tions of material existence. To deliver us from these miserable conditions,
You have advented Yourself in this transcendental form. This is evidence
of Your unlimited causeless mercy upon those of us who are suffering in
this way. What, then, to speak of the devotees to whom You are always so
favorably disposed?
PURPORT
When the Lord appears in His original form, He acts to deliver the pious
and annihilate the miscreants (Bg. 4.8). Although He annihilates the de-
mons, He nonetheless benefits them. It is said that all the living entities
who died on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra attained their original consti
tutional position (svariipa) because they had the chance to see Krsna face
to face riding in the chariot of Arjuna. On the Battlefield of Kuruksetra,
superficially two things were going on—the demons were being killed, and
the devotee, Arjuna, was being protected. However, the results were the
same for everyone. Thus it is said that the appearance of the Lord di-
minishes all kinds of miserable conditions caused by material existence.
It is clearly stated in this verse that this form (asesa-klesa-sanksayam)
is meant to diminish all the miserable conditions experienced in life not
only by the devotees but by all others. Aviskrtam nah klistanam. The


--- Page 386 ---
1522 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 30
Pracetas identified themselves as common men. Kim anyad anukampitam.
The devotees are always favorably accepted by the Lord. The Lord shows
all mercy not only to conditioned souls, but also to the devotees who are
already liberated due to their devotional service.

The form of the Lord as worshiped in the temples is called arca-vigraha
or arcavatara, the worshipable form, the Deity incarnation. This facility is
offered to neophyte devotees so that they can see the real form of the
Lord face to face and offer their respectful obeisances and sacrifices in
the form of arca. Through such facilities the neophytes gradually invoke
their original Krsna consciousness. Deity worship in the form of temple
worship is the most valuable benediction given by the Lord to beginners.
All neophytes must therefore engage in the worship of the Lord by keep-
ing the arca-vigraha (arcavatara) at home or in the temple.

TRANSLATION

Dear Lord, You are the killer of all inauspicious things. You are com-
passionate upon Your poor devotees through the expansion of Your arca-
vigraha. You should certainly think of us as Your eternal servants.

PURPORT

The form of the Lord known as arca-vigraha is an expansion of His
unlimited potencies. When the Lord is gradually satisfied with the service
of a devotee, in due course of time He accepts the devotee as one of His


--- Page 387 ---
Text 29] The Activities of the Pracetas 1523
many unalloyed servants. By nature, the Lord is very compassionate;
therefore the service of neophyte devotees is accepted by the Lord. As
confirmed in Bhagavad-gita:
patrari puspam phalam toyari
yo me bhaktya prayacchati
tad aham bhakty-upahrtam
asnami prayatatmanah
“If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit or water, |
will accept it.” (Bg. 9.26)

The devotee offers eatables in the form of vegetables, fruits, leaves and
water to the arca-vigraha. The Lord, being bhakta-vatsala, compassionate
upon His devotees, accepts these offerings. Atheists may think that the
devotees are engaged in idol worship, but the fact is different. Janardana,
the Supreme Lord, accepts bhava, the attitude of service. The neophyte
devotee engaged in the worship of the Lord may not understand the value
of such worship, but the Supreme Lord, being bhakta-vatsala, accepts His
devotee and in due course of time takes him home.

In this connection there is a story about a brahmana who was offering
sweet rice to the Lord within his mind. The br@ahmana had no money nor
any means of worshiping the Deity, but within his mind he arranged every-
thing nicely. He had gold pots to bring water from the sacred rivers to
wash the Deity, and he offered the Deity very sumptuous food, including
sweet rice. Once, before he offered the sweet rice, he thought that it was
too hot, and he thought, “Oh, let me test it. My, it is very hot.” When he
put his finger in the sweet rice to test it, his finger was burned and his
meditation broken. Although he was offering food to the Lord within
his mind, the Lord accepted it nonetheless. Consequently the Lord in
Vaikuntha immediately sent a chariot to bring the brahmana back home,
back to Godhead. Thus it is the duty of every sincere devotee to accept
the arca-vigraha at home or in the temple and worship the form of the
Lord as advised in authorized scriptures and directed by the spiritual
master.

TRANSLATION

When the Lord, out of His natural compassion, thinks of His devotee,
by that process only are all desires of the neophyte devotee fulfilled. The
Lord is situated in every living entity’s heart, although the living entity
may be very insignificant. The Lord knows everything about the living
entity, including all his desires. Although we are very insignificant, why
should the Lord not know our desires?

PURPORT

A very advanced devotee does not think himself advanced. He is always
very humble. The Supreme Personality of Godhead in His plenary expan-
sion as the Paramatma, or Supersoul, sits in everyone’s heart and can
understand the attitudes and desires of His devotees. The Lord also gives
opportunity to the nondevotees to fulfill their desires, as confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita (mattah 5712477 jianam apohanam ca).

Whatever a living entity desires, however insignificant he may be, is
noted by the Lord, who gives him a chance to fulfill his desires. If the
desires of the nondevotees are fulfilled, why not those of the devotee? A
pure devotee simply wants to engage in the service of the Lord without
material desire, and if he wants this within the core of his heart, where the
Lord is situated, and if he is without ulterior motive, why should the Lord
not understand? If a sincere devotee renders service to the Lord or to the
arca-vigraha, the form of the Lord, all his activities prove successful be-
cause the Lord is present within his heart and understands his sincerity.
Thus if a devotee, with all confidence, goes on discharging the prescribed
duties of devotional service, he will ultimately attain success.

TRANSLATION

O Lord of the universe, You are the actual teacher of the science of
devotional service. We are satisfied that Your Lordship is the ultimate
goal of our lives, and we pray that You will be satisfied with us. That is
our benediction. We do not desire anything other than Your full satisfac-
tion.

PURPORT

In thisverse the words apavarga-gurur gatih are very significant. Accord-
ing to Srimad-Bhagavatam, the Supreme Lord is the ultimate fact of the
Absolute Truth. Brahmeti paramatmeti bhagavan iti Sabdyate (Bhag.
1.2.11). The Absolute Truth is realized in three features—impersonal
Brahman, localized Paramatma and ultimately the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Bhagavan. The word apavarga means liberation. Pavarga means
material existence. In material existence, one always works very hard but
is ultimately baffled. One then dies and has to accept another body to
work very hard again. This is the cycle of material existence. Apavarga
means just the opposite. Instead of working hard like cats and dogs, one
returns home, back to Godhead. Liberation begins with merging into the
Brahman effulgence of the Supreme Lord. This conception is held by the
jiani-sampraddya, philosophical speculators, butrealization of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead is higher. When a devotee understands that the
Lord is satisfied, liberation, or merging into the effulgence of the Lord, is
notvery difficult. One has to approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead
through the impersonal Brahman effulgence just as one has to approach
the sun through the sunshine. It is not very difficult to merge into the
impersonal effulgence of the Lord, Brahman, if one has satisfied the
Supreme Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION

Dear Lord, we shall therefore pray for Your benediction because You
are the Supreme beyond all transcendence and because there is no end to
Your opulences. Consequently You are celebrated by the name Ananta.

PURPORT

There was no need for the Pracetas to ask any benediction from the
Supreme Lord because the devotees are simply satisfied by the presence
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Dhruva Maharaja practiced severe
austerities and penances to see the Supreme Lord, and his intention was
to receive benediction from the Lord. He wanted to acquire the throne of
his father—or attain an even better position—but when he was actually in
the presence of the Supreme Lord, he forgot everything. He said, “My
dear Lord, I do not wish to ask any benediction.” This is the actual
position of the devotee. The devotee simply wants to be in the presence
of the Supreme Lord—either in this world or in the next—and engage in
His service. That is the ultimate goal and benediction for the devotees.

The Lord asked the Pracetas to pray for some benediction, and they
said, “What kind of benediction should we pray for? The Lord is unlimited,
and there are unlimited benedictions.” The purport is that if one must ask
for benediction, he must ask for unlimited benediction. The words tvat
paratah are very significant in this verse. The Supreme Personality of
Godhead is paratah parat. The word para means transcendental, beyond
this material world. The impersonal Brahman effulgence is beyond this


--- Page 391 ---
Text 32] The Activities of the Pracetas 1527
material world, and this is called param padam. Aruhya krcchrena pararit
padam (Bhag. 10.2.32). Merging into the impersonal effulgence of the
Lord is called param padam, but there is a higher transcendental position,
which is the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Brahmeti
paramatmeti bhagavan iti sabdyate (Bhag. 1.2.11). The Absolute Truth is
realized first as impersonal Brahman, then as Paramatma, and finally as
Bhagavan. Thus the Personality of Godhead, Bhagavan, is paratah parat,
beyond Brahman and Paramatma realization. In this connection, Srila
Jiva Gosvami points out that paratah parat means “better than the best.”
The best is the spiritual world, and. it is known as Brahman. The Supreme
Personality of Godhead, however, is known as Parabrahman. Therefore
paratah parat means ‘better than Brahman realization.”

As will be explained in the next verse, the Pracetas planned to ask the
Lord for something that has no limit. The Lord’s pastimes, qualities, forms
and names are all unlimited. There is no limit to His name, forms, pastimes,
creation and paraphernalia. The living entity cannot conceive of the un-
limitedness of the unlimited. However, if living entities are engaged in
hearing about the unlimited potencies of the Supreme Lord, they are fac-
tually connected directly to the unlimited. Such understanding of the un-
limited becomes unlimited by hearing and chanting.

action. Similarly, when we have approached Your lotus feet and taken
shelter of them, what further benediction may we ask of You?
PURPORT

When a devotee is actually engaged in the service of the lotus feet of the
Lord, his engagement in itself is so perfect that there is no need to ask for
further benediction. When a bee approaches the pdrijata tree, it gets un-
limited supplies of honey. There is no need to go to another tree. If one is
fixed in the service of the lotus feet of the Lord, there is unlimited
transcendental bliss, and as such there is no need to ask for further bene-
diction. The parijata tree is not commonly found within this material
world. The parijata tree is also known as kalpa-vrksa, or the wish-fulfilling
tree. One can get anything he desires from such a tree. In the material
world, one can get oranges from an orange tree or mangoes from a mango
tree, but there is no possibility of getting oranges from a mango tree or
vice versa. However, one can get whatever he wants from the parijata
tree—oranges, mangoes, bananas, and so on. This tree is found in the
spiritual world. Cintamani-prakara-sadmasu kalpa-vrksa-laksavrtesu. The
spiritual world, cintamani-dhama, is surrounded by these kalpa-vrksa trees,
but the pdrijata tree is also found in the kingdom of Indra, that is, on
Indra’s heavenly planet. This parijata tree was brought by Krsna to please
Satyabhama, one of His queens, and this tree was implanted in the Dvaraka
mansions constructed for the queens. The lotus feet of the Lord are exact-
ly like the parijata trees, or wish-fulfilling trees, and the devotees are like
bumblebees. They are always attracted by the lotus feet of the Lord.

TRANSLATION

Dear Lord, as long as we have to remain within this material world due
to our material contamination and wander from one type of body to
another and from one planet to another, we pray that we may associate
with those who are engaged in discussing Your pastimes. We pray for this
benediction life after life, in different bodily forms and on different planets.

PURPORT

This is the best benediction that a devotee can ask of the Supreme Lord.
This is also confirmed by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu: sthane sthitah §ruti-
gatam tanu-van-manobhif (Bhag. 10.14.3). One may be in one position or
another according to destiny, but in any case one must continue to hear
about the activities and pastimes of the Supreme Lord, regardless of cir-
cumstances. A pure devotee does not pray for liberation or for cessation
of the cycle of birth and death because he doesnot consider thatimportant.
The most important thing for a devotee is getting a chance to hear about
the pastimes and glories of the Lord. The devotees who engage in the service
of the Lord in this world will have the same opportunity in the spiritual
world also. Thus for a devotee, everything is in the spiritual world, for as
long as he can hear about the pastimes of the Lord, or wherever he can
chant, the Lord is personally present. Tatra tisthami narada yatra gayanti
mad-bhaktah. When the pure devotees assemble to chant, hear and talk
about the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the place where they assemble
becomes Vaikuntha. For the devotee there is no need to pray to the Lord
for transferral to the Vaikuntha world. A pure devotee can create
Vaikuntha or Vrndavana anywhere simply by chanting the glories of the
Lord without offense.

The Pracetas pray for an opportunity to hear of the glories of the Lord
in every form of life (bhave bhave). A living entity transmigrates from one
body to another. The devotee is not particularly eager to stop this process.
Caitanya Mahaprabhu prays, mama janmani janmanisvare bhavatad bhaktir
ahaituki tvayi: “My dear Lord, life after life may I be fixed in Your pure
devotional service.” Out of humility, a devotee considers himself unfit to
be transferred to the spiritual world. He always thinks himself contami-
nated by the modes of material nature. Nor is there any need for a devotee
to ask to be freed from the modes of material nature. Devotional service


--- Page 394 ---
1530 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 30
itself is in the transcendental position; therefore there is no question of
asking for this special facility. The conclusion is that a pure devotee is not
anxious to stop the repetition of birth and death, but is always eager to
associate with other devotees who are engaged in chanting and hearing
about the glories of the Lord.

has stated: kaivalyarh narakdyate tridasa-pir akasa-puspayate. For a pure
devotee, kaivalya, merging into the existence of Brahman, the Brahman
effulgence, is no better than living in hell. Similarly, he considers promo-
tion to heavenly planets (tridasa-piir) just another kind of phantasmagoria.
In other words, a pure devotee does not place much value in the destina-
tion of the karmis (the heavenly planets), nor in the destination of the
jnanis (merging into the Brahman effulgence). A pure devotee considers
a moment’s association with another pure devotee to be far superior to
residing in a heavenly planet or merging in the Brahman effulgence. The

topmost benediction for those who are living in this material world and
are subjected to the repetition of birth and death (transmigration) is asso-
ciation with pure devotees. One should search out such pure devotees and
remain with them. That will make one completely happy, even though
living within the material world. This Krsna consciousness movement is
started for that purpose. A person who is overly affected materially may
take advantage of this movement and become intimately associated with
it. In this way the confused and frustrated inhabitants of this material
world may find the highest happiness in association with devotees.

TRANSLATION

Whenever pure topics of the transcendental world are discussed, the
members of the audience forget all kinds of material hankerings, at least
for the time being. Not only that, but they are no longer envious of one
another, nor do they suffer from anxiety or fear.

PURPORT

Vaikuntha means “without anxiety,” and the material world means full
of anxiety. As stated by Prahlada Maharaja: sada samudvigna-dhiyam asad-
grahat (Bhag. 7.5.5). The living entities who have accepted this material
world as a residence are full of anxiety. A place immediately becomes
Vaikuntha whenever the holy topics of the Personality of Godhead are
discussed by pure devotees. This is the process of $ravapam kirtanam
visnoh, chanting and hearing about the Supreme Lord Visnu. As the Su-
preme Lord Himself confirms:


--- Page 396 ---
1532 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 30
naham tisthami vaikunthe
yoginam hrdayesu va
tatra tisthami narada
yatra gayanti mad-bhaktah
“My dear Narada, actually I do not reside in My abode, Vaikuntha, nor do
I reside within the hearts of yogis, but I reside in that place where My
pure devotees chant My holy name and discuss My form, pastimes and
qualities.” Because of the presence of the Lord in the form of the tran-
scendental vibration, the Vaikuntha atmosphere is evoked. This atmosphere
is without fear and anxiety. One living entity does not fear another. By
hearing the holy names and glories of the Lord, a person executes pious ac-
tivities. Srnvatam sva-kathah krsnah pupya-sravapa-kirtanah (Bhag. 1.2.17).
Thus his material hankerings immediately stop. This sarnikirtana movement
started by the Society for Krishna Consciousness is meant for creating
Vaikuntha, the transcendental world that is without anxiety, even in this
material world. The method is the propagation of the sravanan kirtanam
process throughout the world. In the material world everyone is envious
of his fellow man. Animalistic envy exists in human society as long as
there is no performance of sainkirtana-yajiia, the chanting of the holy
names—Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare
Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. The Pracetas therefore decided to remain
always in the society of devotees, and they considered that to be the
highest benediction possible in human life.

TRANSLATION
The Supreme Lord, Narayana, is present amongst devotees who are en-
gaged in hearing and chanting the holy name of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. Lord Narayana is the ultimate goal of sannyasis, those in the
renounced order of life, and Narayana is worshiped through this sarikirtana
movement by those who are liberated from material contamination. Indeed,
they recite the holy name again and again.
PURPORT
The Mayavadi sannyasis are missing the real presence of Narayana.
This is because they falsely claim to be Narayana Himself. According to
the customary etiquette of Mayavadi sannyasis, they address one another
as Narayana. To say that everyone is a temple of Narayana is correct, but
to accept another human being as Narayana is a great offense. The con-
ception of daridra-narayana (poor Narayana), an attempt to identify the
poor with Narayana, is also a great offense. Even to identify Narayana
with demigods like Lord Brahma and Lord Siva is an offense.
yas tu narayanam devam
brahma-rudradi-daivataih
samatvenaiva vikseta
sa pasandi bhaved dhruvam
“One who considers Lord Narayana on a level with great demigods like
Lord Brahma and Lord Siva is immediately listed amongst nonbelievers.”
The fact is that by performing sanikirtana-yajiia one can immediately please
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then Narayana Himself descends
and immediately is present. In this age of Kali, Narayana is immediately
present in the form of Lord Caitanya. Concerning Lord Caitanya, Srimad-
Bhagavatam states:
krsna-varnam tvisakrsnarm
sangopangastra-parsadam
Yyajiaih sankirtana-prayair
yajanti hi sumedhasah
“In the age of Kali, intelligent persons perform congregational chanting to
worship the incarnation of Godhead who constantly sings the name of


--- Page 398 ---
1534 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 30
Krsna. Although His complexion is not blackish, He is Krsna Himself. He
is accompanied by His associates, servants, weapons and confidential com-
panions.” (Bhag. 11.5.32)

After all, human life is meant for pleasing Narayana, and this can easily
be done by performing sarikirtana-yajia. Whenever there is congregational
chanting of the holy names of the Lord, Gaura Narayana, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead in His incarnation as Lord Caitanya, immediately
appears and is worshiped by sankirtana-yajhia.

In this verse it is said that Narayana is nyasinam 8৫৫, the ultimate goal
of the sannyasis. The goal of those who have renounced the material
world is the attainment of Narayana. A Vaisnava sannyasi therefore dedi-
cates his life to serving Narayana; he does not falsely claim to be Narayana.
Instead of becoming nirvaira (nonenvious of other living entities), one who
tries to become Narayana becomes envious of the Supreme Lord. Therefore
the attempt to become Narayana constitutes the greatest offense. Actually
when one chants or discusses the transcendental activities of the Lord, he
immediately becomes nonenvious. In this material world everyone is
envious of everyone else, but by vibrating or discussing the holy name of
the Lord, one becomes nonenvious and devoid of material hankering.
Because of our envy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we have
become envious of all other living entities. When we are no longer envious
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there will be real peace, unity
and fraternity in human society. Without Narayana or sarnkirtana-yajiia
there cannot be peace in this material world.

TRANSLATION

Dear Lord, Your personal associates, devotees, wander all over the world
to purify even the holy places of pilgrimage. Is not such activity pleasing
to those who are actually afraid of material existence?

PURPORT

There are two kinds of devotees. One is called gosthanandi and the
other bhajananandi. The word bhajananandi refers to the devotee who
does not move but remains in one place. Such a devotee is always engaged
in the devotional service of the Lord. He chants the maha mantra as
taught by many acaryas and sometimes goes out for preaching work. The
gosthanandi is one who desires to increase the number of devotees all
over the world. He travels all over the world just to purify the world and
the people residing in it. Caitanya Mahaprabhu advised: prthivite ache
yata nagaradi grama sarvatra pracara haibe mora nama. Lord Caitanya
Mahaprabhu wanted His followers to move all over the world and preach
in every town and village. In the Caitanya-sampradaya those who strictly
follow the principles of Lord Caitanya must travel all over the world to
preach the message of Lord Caitanya, which is the same as preaching the
words of Krsna—Bhagavad-gita—and Srimad-Bhagavatam. The more the
devotees preach the principles of krsna-katha, the more people throughout
the world will benefit.

Devotees like the great sage Narada who travel all over to preach are
called gosthanandi. Narada Muni is always wandering throughout the uni-
verse just to create different types of devotees. Narada even made a hunter
a devotee. He also made Dhruva Maharaja and Prahlada devotees. Actually
all devotees are indebted to the great sage Narada, for he has wandered
both in heaven and in hell. A devotee of the Lord is not even afraid of hell.
He goes to preach the glories of the Lord everywhere—even in hell-because
there is no distinction between heaven and hell for a devotee.

“A pure devotee of Narayana is never afraid of going anywhere and every-
where. For him heaven and hell are one and the same.” (Bhag. 6.17.28)
Such devotees, wandering all over the world, deliver those who are actu-

ally afraid of this material existence. Some people are already disgusted
with material existence, being confused and frustrated by material enjoy-
ment, and some people, who are intelligent, are interested in understanding
the Supreme Lord. Both may take advantage of the pure devotee who
wanders throughout the world.

When a pure devotee goes to a place of pilgrimage, he desires to purify
that holy place of pilgrimage. Many sinful men bathe in the holy waters of the
places of pilgrimage. They take their baths in the waters of the Ganges
and Yamuna at places such as Prayag, Vrndavana and Mathura. In this way
the sinful men are purified, but their sinful actions and reactions remain
at the holy places of pilgrimage. When a devotee comes to take his bath at
those places of pilgrimage, the sinful reactions left by the sinful men are
neutralized by the devotee. Tirthi-kurvanti tirthani svantah-sthena gada-
bhrta (Bhag. 1.13.10). Because the devotee always carries the Supreme
Personality of Godhead within his heart, wherever he goes becomes a place
of pilgrimage, a holy place for understanding the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. It is therefore the duty of everyone to associate with a pure
devotee and thus attain freedom from material contamination. Everyone
should take advantage of the wandering devotees whose only business is
to deliver conditioned souls from the clutches of maya.

TRANSLATION

Dear Lord, by virtue of a moment’s association with Lord Siva, who is
very dear to You and who is Your most intimate friend, we were fortunate
to attain You. You are the most expert physician capable of treating the
incurable disease of material existence. On account of our great fortune,
we have been able to take shelter at Your lotus feet.

PURPORT

It has been said: harin vind na srtim taranti. Without taking shelter of
the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead, one cannot attain relief from
the clutches of maya, the repetition of birth, old age, disease and death.
The Pracetas received the shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead
by the grace of Lord Siva. Lord Siva is the supreme devotee of Lord Visnu,
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Vaisnavanan: yatha sambhuh: The
most exalted Vaisnava is Lord Siva, and those who are actually devotees
of Lord Siva follow Lord Siva’s advice and take shelter at the lotus feet of
Lord Visnu. The so-called devotees of Lord Siva who are simply after ma-
terial prosperity are in a way deceived by Lord Siva. He does not actually
deceive them, because Lord Siva has no business deceiving people, but
because the so-called devotees of Lord Siva want to be deceived, Lord
Siva, who is very easily pleased, allows them all kinds of material benedic-
tions. These benedictions might ironically result in the destruction of the
so-called devotees. For instance, Ravana took all material benediction
from Lord Siva, but the result was that he was ultimately destroyed with
his family, kingdom and everything else because he misused Lord Siva’s
benediction. Because of his material power, he became very proud and
puffed up so that he dared kidnap the wife of Lord Ramacandra. In this
way he was ruined. To get material benedictions from Lord Siva is not
difficult, but actually these are not benedictions. The Pracetas received
benediction from Lord Siva, and as a result they attained the shelter of
the lotus feet of Lord Visnu. This is real benediction. The gopis also wor-
shiped Lord Siva in Vrndavana, and the Lord is still staying there as
Gopisvara. The gopis, however, prayed that Lord Siva bless them by giving
them Lord Krsna as their husband. There is no harm in worshiping the
demigods, provided that one’s aim is to return home, back to Godhead.
Generally people go to the demigods for material benefit, as indicated in
Bhagavad-gita:

kamais tais tair hrta-jianah
prapadyante ‘nya-devatih


--- Page 402 ---
1538 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 30
tam tari niyamam dsthaya
prakrtya niyatah svaya
“Those whose minds are distorted by material desires surrender unto
demigods and follow the particular rules and regulations of worship ac-
cording to their own natures.” (Bg. 7.20)

One enamored by material benefits is called hrta-jiiana (one who has
lost his intelligence). In this connection it is to be noted that sometimes
in revealed scriptures Lord Siva is described as being nondifferent from
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The point is that Lord Siva and
Lord Vignu are so intimately connected that there is no difference in
opinion. The actual fact is: ekale i$vara krsnpa, ara saba bhrtya. “The only
supreme master is Krsna, and all others are His devotees or servants.”
(০০. Adi 5.142) This is the real fact, and there is no difference of opinion
between Lord Siva and Lord Visnu in this connection. Nowhere in revealed
scripture does Lord Siva claim to be equal to Lord Visnu. This is simply
the creation of the so-called devotees of Lord Siva, who claim that Lord
Siva and Lord Visnu are one. This is strictly forbidden in the vaispava-
tantra: yas tu narayanari devam. Lord Visnu, Lord Siva and Lord Brahma
are intimately connected as master and servants. Siva-virifici-nutam. Visnu
is honored and offered obeisances by Lord Siva and Lord Brahma. To
consider that they are all equal is a great offense. They are all equal in the
sense that Lord Visnu is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and all others
are His eternal servants.

Dear Lord, we have studied the Vedas, accepted a spiritual master, and
offered respect to brahmanas, advanced devotees and aged personalities
who are spiritually very advanced. We have offered our respects to them,
and we have not been envious of any brother, friends or anyone else. We
have also undergone severe austerities within the water and have not taken
food for a long time. All these spiritual assets of ours are simply offered
for Your satisfaction. We pray for this benediction only, and nothing more.
PURPORT
As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam, sarisiddhir hari-tosanam: the real
perfection of life is pleasing the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Vedais
ca sarvair aham eva vedyah: In understanding the Vedas, one has to under-
stand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who has actually under-
stood Him surrenders unto Him after many, many births. We find all these
qualifications in the Pracetas. They underwent severe austerities and


--- Page 404 ---
1540 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 30
penances within the water, and they did not take any food for a very long
time. They practiced these austerities not for material benediction but for
the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord. One may engage in any business—
material or spiritual-but the purpose should be the satisfaction of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. This verse presents a perfect picture of
Vedic civilization. People training to become devotees should be respectful
not only to the Supreme Personality of Godhead but also to those who
are elderly in knowledge, who are Aryans and actual devotees of the Lord.
An Aryan is one who does not boast but is an actual devotee of the Lord.
Aryan means advanced. Formerly, those who claimed to be Aryans had to
be devotees of the Lord. For instance, in Bhagavad-gita Krsna chastised
Arjuna by saying that he was speaking like a non-Aryan.

§ri bhagavan uvaca

kutas {एक kasmalam idam
visame samupasthitam
andrya-justam asvargyam

akirti-karam arjuna
“The Supreme Person [Bhagavan] said: My dear Arjuna, how have these
impurities come upon you? They are not at all befitting a man who knows
the progressive values of life. They do not lead to higher planets, but to
infamy.” (Bg. 2.2)

Arjuna, the ksatriya, was refusing to fight despite being directly ordered
by the Supreme Lord. He was thus chastised by the Lord as belonging to a
non-Aryan family. Anyone who is advanced in the devotional service of
the Lord certainly knows his duty. It does not matter whether this duty is
violent or nonviolent. If it is sanctioned and ordered by the Supreme Lord,
it must be performed. An Aryan performs his duty. It is not that the
Aryans are unnecessarily inimical to living entities. The Aryans never main-
tained slaughterhouses, and they are never enemies of poor animals. The
Pracetas underwent severe austerities for many, many years, even within
the water. Accepting austerities and penances is the avowed business of
those interested in advanced civilization.

The word nirendhasam means without food. Eating voraciously and
unnecessarily is not the business of an Aryan. Rather, the eating process
should be restricted as far as possible. When Aryans eat, they eat only
prescribed eatables. Regarding this, the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita:

patram [01457007 phalari toyari
yo me bhaktya prayacchati


--- Page 405 ---
Text 41] The Activities of the Pracetas 1541
tad कोः bhakty-upahrtam
asnami prayatatmanah
“If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit or water, I
will accept it.”” (Bg. 9.26) ति
Thus there are restrictions for the advanced Aryans. Although the Lord
Himself can eat anything and everything, He nonetheless restricts Himself
to vegetables, fruits, milk, and so on. This verse thus describes the activities
of those who claim to be Aryans.

Dear Lord, even great yogis and mystics who are very much advanced by
virtue of austerities and knowledge and who have completely situated
themselves in pure existence, as well as great personalities like Manu, Lord
Brahma and Lord Siva, cannot fully understand Your glories and potencies.
Nonetheless they have offered their prayers according to their own capaci-
ties. In the same way, we, although much lower than these personalities,
also offer our prayers according to our own capability.


--- Page 406 ---
1542 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 30
PURPORT

Lord Brahma, Lord Siva, Manu (the father of mankind), great saintly
persons and also great sages who have elevated themselves to the tran-
scendental platform through austerities and penance, as well as devotional
service, are imperfect in knowledge compared to the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. This is the case with anyone within this material world. No
one can be equal to the Supreme Lord in anything, certainly not in knowl-
edge. Consequently anyone’s prayer to the Supreme Personality of
Godhead is never complete. It is not possible to measure the complete
glories of the Supreme Lord, who is unlimited. Even the Lord Himself in
His incarnation as Ananta or Sesa cannot describe His own glories. Al-
though Ananta has many thousands of faces and has been glorifying the
Lord for many, many years, He could not find the limit of the glories of
the Lord. Thus it is not possible to estimate the complete potencies and
glories of the Supreme Lord.

Nonetheless, everyone in devotional service can offer essential prayers
to the Lord. Everyone is situated in a relative position, and no one is per-
fect in glorifying the Lord. Beginning with Lord Brahma and Lord Siva
down to ourselves, everyone is the servant of the Supreme Lord. We are all
situated in relative positions according to our own karma. Yet every one of
us can offer prayers with heart and soul as far as we can appreciate the
Lord’s glories. That is our perfection. Even when one is in the darkest
region of existence, he is allowed to offer prayers to the Lord according to
his own capacity. The Lord therefore says in Bhagavad-gita:

mari hi partha vyapasritya
ye pi syuh papa-yonayah
striyo vai§yds tatha sadras
te 7 yanti param gatim
“O son of Prtha, those who take shelter in Me, though they be of lower
birth—woman, vaiSyas [merchants], as well as $idras [workers] —can ap-
proach the supreme destination.” (Bg. 9.32)

If one seriously accepts the lotus feet of the Lord, he is purified by the
grace of the Lord and by the grace of the Lord’s servant. This is confirmed
by Sukadeva Gosvami: ye ’nye ca pdpd yad apasrayasrayah sudhyanti
tasmai prabhavispave namah (Bhag. 2.4.18). One who is brought under the
lotus feet of the Lord by the endeavor of the Lord’s servant, the spiritual
master, is certainly immediately purified, however lowborn he may be. He
becomes eligible to return home, back to Godhead.

Dear Lord, You have no enemies or friends. Therefore You are equal to
everyone. You cannot be contaminated by sinful activities, and Your tran-
scendental form is always beyond the material creation. You are the
Supreme Personality of Godhead because You remain everywhere within
all existence. You are consequently known as Vasudeva. We offer You our
respectful obeisances.

PURPORT

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is known as Vasudeva because He
lives everywhere. The word vas means “to live.” As stated in Brahma-
sarihita, eko ’py asau racayitun jagad-anda-kotim: the Lord, through His
plenary portion, enters into each and every universe to create the material
manifestation. He also enters into each and every heart in all living entities
and into each and every atom also (paramanu-cayantara-stham). Because
the Supreme Lord lives everywhere, He is known as Vasudeva. Although
He lives everywhere within the material world, He is not contaminated by
the modes of nature. The Lord is therefore described in [80100118500 as
apapa-viddham. He is never contaminated by the modes of material nature.
When the Lord descends on this planet, He acts in many ways. He kills
demons and performs acts not sanctioned by the Vedic principles, that is,
acts considered sinful. Even though He acts in such a way, He is never
contaminated by His action. He is therefore described herein as suddha,


--- Page 408 ---
1544 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 30
meaning always free from contamination. The Lord is also sama, equal to
everyone. In this regard, He states in Bhagavad-gita:
samo "hari sarva-bhiitesu
na me dvesyo ’sti na priyah
ye bhajanti tu mam bhaktya
mayi te tesu capy aham
“I envy no one, nor am I partial to anyone. I am equal to all. But whoever
renders service unto Me in devotion is a friend, is in Me, and I am also a
friend to him.” (Bg. 9.29) The Lord has no one as His friend or enemy,
and He is equal to everyone.

The word sattvaya indicates that the form of the Lord is not material. It
is sac-cid-ananda-vigraha. I$varah paramah krspah sac-cid-ananda-vigrahah.
His body is different from our material bodies. One should not think that
the Supreme Personality of Godhead has a material body like ours.

Text 44] The Activities of the Pracetas 1545
TRANSLATION

The great sage Maitreya continued: My dear Vidura, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, who is the protector of surrendered souls, being
thus addressed by the Pracetas and worshiped by them, replied, “May
whatever You have prayed for be fulfilled.” After saying this, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, whose prowess is never defeated, left. The
Pracetas were unwilling to be separated from Him because they had not
seen Him to their full satisfaction.

PURPORT

The word anapavarga-virya is significant in this verse. The word ana
means ‘‘without,” pavarga means “016 materialistic way of life,” and virya
means “prowess.” The prowess of the Supreme Personality of Godhead
always contains six basic opulences, one of which is renunciation. Al-
though the Pracetas desired to see the Lord to their full satisfaction, the
Lord nonetheless left. According to Srila Jiva Gosvami, this is an exhibition
of His kindness to innumerable other devotees. Although He was being
attracted by the Pracetas, He left. This is an example of His renunciation.
This renunciation was also exhibited by Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu when
He stayed with Advaita Prabhu after taking sannydsa. All the devotees
there wanted Him to stay a few days longer, but Lord Caitanya left with-
out hesitation. The conclusion is that although the Supreme Lord has un-
limited kindness for His devotees, He is not attached to anyone. He is
equally kind to His innumerable devotees all over the creation.

TRANSLATION

Thereafter all the Pracetas emerged from the waters of the sea. They
then saw that all the trees on land had grown very tall as if to obstruct
the path of the heavenly planets. These trees had covered the entire surface
of the world. At this time the Pracetas became very angry.

PURPORT

King Pracinabarhigat left his kingdom before his sons arrived after their
execution of penance and austerity. The sons, the Pracetas, were ordered
by the Supreme Personality of Godhead to come out of the water and go
to the kingdom of their father in order to take care of that kingdom.
However, when they came out, they saw that everything had been neglect-
ed due to the King’s absence. They first observed that foodgrains were
not being produced and that there were no agricultural activities. Indeed,
the surface of the world was practically covered by very tall trees. It
seemed as though the trees were determined to stop people from going
into outer space to reach the heavenly kingdoms. The Pracetas became very
angry when they saw the surface of the globe covered in this way. They
desired that the land be cleared for crops.

It is not a fact that jungles and trees attract clouds and rain, because we
find rainfall over the sea. Human beings can inhabit any place on the sur-
face of the earth by clearing jungles and converting land for agricultural
purposes. People can keep cows, and all economic problems can be solved
in that way. One need only work to produce grains and take care of the
cows. The wood found in the jungles may be used for constructing cottages.
In this way the economic problem of humanity can be solved. At the pres-
ent moment there are many vacant lands throughout the world, and if
they are properly utilized, there will be no scarcity of food. As far as rain
is concerned, it is the performance of yajfia that attracts rain. As stated
in Bhagavad-gita: ति „ , , __ _

annad bhavanti bhatani
parjanyad anna-sambhavah
yajiiad bhavati parjanyo
yajiiah karma-samudbhavah
“All living bodies subsist on food grains, which are produced from rains.
Rains are produced by performance of yajita [sacrifice] , and yajiia is born
of prescribed duties.” (Bg. 3.14)
By performing sacrifice, man will have sufficient rainfall and crops.

My dear King, at the time of devastation, Lord Siva emits fire and air
from his mouth out of anger. To make the surface of the earth completely
treeless, the Pracetas also emitted fire and air from their mouths.
PURPORT
In this verse Vidura is addressed 85 rajan, which means ““O King.” In this
regard, Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thiakura comments that a dhira never
becomes angry because he is always situated in devotional service. Ad-
vanced devotees can control their senses; therefore a devotee can be ad-
dressed as rajan. A king controls and rules in various ways amongst citizens;
similarly, one who can control his senses is the king of his senses. He is
a svami or gosvami. The svamis and gosvamis are therefore sometimes ad-
dressed as mahardja, or king.

Whenever there is some uncommon occurrence on any planet, Lord
Brahma, being in charge of the whole universe, immediately comes to con-
trol the situation. Lord Brahma also came when Hiranyakasipu underwent
severe penances and austerities and made the whole universe tremble. A
responsible man in any establishment is always alert to keep peace and
harmony within the establishment. Similarly, Lord Brahma is also al-
lowed to keep peace and harmony within this universe. He consequently
pacified the sons of King Barhisman with good logic.

Text 48] The Activities of the Pracetas 1549
PURPORT
The daughter of the trees is referred to in text thirteen of this chapter.
This daughter was born of Kandu and Pramloca. The society girl Pramloca,
after giving birth to the child, immediately left for the heavenly kingdom.
While the child was crying, the King of the moon took compassion upon
her and saved her by putting his finger into her mouth. This child was
cared for by the trees, and when she grew up, by the order of Lord
Brahma, she was delivered to the Pracetas as their wife. The name of the
girl was Mariga, as the next verse will explain. It was the predominating
deity of the trees that delivered the daughter. In this connection Srila Jiva
Gosvami Prabhupada states, vrksah tad-adhisthatr-devatah: “The ‘trees’
means the controlling deity of those trees.” In Vedic literatures we find
that there is a controlling deity of the water; similarly, there is a control-
ling deity of the trees. The Pracetas were engaged in burning all the trees
to ashes, and they considered the trees their enemies. To pacify the
Pracetas, the predominating deity of the trees, under the advice of Lord
Brahma, delivered the daughter Marisa.

TRANSLATION
Following the order of Lord Brahma, all the Pracetas accepted the girl
as their wife. From the womb of this girl, the son of Lord Brahma named
Daksa took birth. Daksa had to take birth in the womb of Marisa due to
his disobeying and disrespecting Lord Mahadeva [Siva]. Consequently he
had to give up his body twice.


--- Page 414 ---
1550 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 30
PURPORT

In this connection the word mahad-avajianat is significant. King Daksa
was the son of Lord Brahma; therefore in a previous birth he was a
brahmana, but because of his behaving like a non-brahmana (abrahmana)
by insulting or disrespecting Lord Mahadeva, he had to take birth within
the semen of a ksatriya. That is to say, he became the son of the Pracetas.
Not only that, but because of his disrespecting Lord Siva, he had to under-
go the tribulation of taking birth within the womb of a woman. In the
Dakga-yajiia arena, he was once killed by Lord Siva’s servant, Virabhadra.
Because that was not sufficient, he again took birth in the womb of Marisa.
At the end of the Daksa-yajiia and the disastrous incidents there, Daksa
offered his prayer to Lord प Although he had to give up his body and
take birth in the womb of a woman impregnated by the semen of a
ksatriya, he nonetheless received all opulence by the grace of Lord Siva.
These are the subtle laws of material nature. Unfortunately, people in this
modern age do not know how these laws are working. Having no knowl-
edge of the eternity of the spirit soul and its transmigration, the popula-
tion of the present age is in the greatest ignorance. Because of this, it is
said in Bhagavatam: mandah sumanda-matayo manda-bhagya hy upadrutah
(Bhdg. 1.1.10). The total population in this age of Kali-yuga is very bad,
lazy, unfortunate and disturbed by material conditions.

TRANSLATION

His previous body had been destroyed, but he, the same Daksa, inspired
by the supreme will, created all the desired living entities in the Caksusa
manvantara.

PURPORT
As stated in Bhagavad-gita:
sahasra-yuga-paryantam
ahar yad brahmano viduh
ratrim yuga-sahasrantarn
te ’ho-ratra-vido janah
“By human calculation, a thousand ages taken together is the duration of
Brahma’s one day. And such also is the duration of his night.” (Bg. 8.17)

Brahma’s one day consists of one thousand cycles of the four yugas—
Satya, Treta, Dvapara and Kali. In that one day there are fourteen
manvantaras, and out of these manvantaras this Caksusa manvantara is the
sixth. The various Manus existing in one day of Lord Brahma are as
follows: (1) Svayambhuva (2) Svarociga (3) Uttama (4) Tamasa (5) Raivata
(6) Caksusa (7) Vaivasvata (8) Savarni (9) Daksa-savarni (10) Brahma-
savarni (11) Dharma-savarpi (12) Rudra-savarni (13) Deva-savarni and (14)
Indra-savarni.

Thus there are fourteen Manus in one day of Brahma. In a year there
are 5,040 Manus. Brahma has to live for one hundred years; consequently
the total of Manus appearing and disappearing during the life of one
Brahma is 504,000. This is the calculation for one universe, and there are
innumerable universes. All these Manus come and go simply by the breath-
ing process of Maha-Visnu. As stated in the Brahma-sarihita:

yasyaika-nisvasita-kalam athavalambya
jivanti loma-vilaja jagad-anda-nathah
visnur mahan sa iha yasya kala-viseso
govindam adi-purusariv tam aham bhajami
The word jagad-anda-natha means Lord Brahma. There are innumerable
jagad-anda-natha Brahmas, and thus we can calculate the many Manus.
The present age is under the control of Vaivasvata Manu. Each Manu lives
4,320,000 years multiplied by 71. The present Manu has already lived for
4,320,000 years multiplied by 28. All these long lifespans are ultimately
ended by the laws of material nature. The controversy of Daksa-yajia took


--- Page 416 ---
1552 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 30
place in the Svayambhuva manvantara period. As a result, Daksa was
punishedby Lord Siva, but by virtue of his prayers to Lord Siva he became
eligible to regain his former opulence. According to Visvanatha Cakravarti
Thakura, Daksa underwent severe penances up to the fifth manvantara.
Thus at the beginning of the sixth manvantara, known as the Caksusa
manvantara, Daksa regained his former opulence by the blessings of Lord
Siva.

After being born, Daksa, by the superexcellence of his bodily luster,
covered all others’ bodily opulence. Because he was very expert in per-
forming fruitive activity, he was called by the name Daksa, meaning ‘‘the

very expert.” Lord Brahma therefore engaged Daksa in the work of gener-
ating living entities and maintaining them. In due course of time, Daksa
also engaged other prajapatis [progenitors] in the process of generation
and maintenance.
PURPORT

Daksa became almost as powerful as Lord Brahma. Consequently Lord
Brahma engaged him in generating population. Daksa was very influential
and opulent. In his own turn, Daksa engaged other prajapatis, headed by
Marici. In this way the population of the universe increased.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fourth Canto, Thirtieth
Chapter of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “The Activities of the
Pracetas.”

The great saint Maitreya continued: After that, the Pracetas lived at
home for thousands of years and developed perfect knowledge in spiritual
consciousness. At last they remembered the blessings of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead and left home, putting their wife in charge of a
perfect son.
PURPORT
After the Pracetas had finished their penances, they were blessed by the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord blessed them by telling them
1555


--- Page 419 ---
1556 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 31
that after finishing their family life they would return home, back to
Godhead, in due course of time. After finishing their family life, which
lasted thousands of years according to the calculations of the demigods,
the Pracetas decided to leave home, putting their wife in the charge of a
son named Daksa. This is the process of Vedic civilization. In the beginning
of life, as a brahmacari, one has to undergo severe penances and austerities
in order to be educated in spiritual values. The brahmacari is never allowed
to mingle with women and is thus kept from learning about sex enjoyment.
The basic flaw in modern civilization is that boys and girls are given free-
dom during school and college to enjoy sex life. Most of the children are
varna-santkara, meaning born of undesirable fathers and mothers. Conse-
quently the whole world is in chaos. Actually human civilization should be
based on the Vedic principles. This means that in the beginning of life boys
and girls should undergo penances and austerities. When they are grown,
they should get married, live for some time at home and beget children.
When the children are grown up, the man should leave home and search for
Krsna consciousness. In this way one can make one’s life perfect by going
home to the kingdom of God.

Unless one practices penances and austerities in his student life, he can-
not understand the existence of God. Without realizing Krsna, one cannot
make his life perfect. The conclusion is that when the children are grown,
the wife should be put in the children’s charge. The husband may then
leave home to develop Krsna consciousness. Everything depends on the
development of mature knowledge. King Pracinabarhisat, the father of the
Pracetas, left home before the arrival of his sons, who were engaged in
austerity within the water. As soon as the time is ripe, or as soon as one has
developed perfect Krsna consciousness, he should leave home, even though
all his duties may not be fulfilled. Pracinabarhisat was waiting for the arrival
of his sons, but, following the instructions of Narada, as soon as his intelli-
gence was properly developed, he simply left instructions for his ministers
to impart to his sons. Thus without waiting for their arrival, he left home.

Giving up a comfortable home life is absolutely necessary for human
beings and is advised by Prahlada Maharaja. Hitvatma-patam grham andha-
kiipam: To finish the materialistic way of life, one should leave his so-called
comfortable home life, which is simply a means for killing the soul (atma-
patam). The home is considered to be a dark well covered by grass, and if
one falls within this well, he simply dies without anyone’s caring. One
should therefore not be too much attached to family life, for it will spoil
one’s development of Krsna consciousness.

TRANSLATION
The Pracetas went to the seashore in the west where the great liberated
sage Jajali was residing. After perfecting the spiritual knowledge by which
one becomes equal to all living entities, the Pracetas became perfect in
Krsna consciousness.
PURPORT
The word brahma-satra means cultivation of spiritual knowledge.
Actually both the Vedas and severe austerity are known as brahma. Vedas
tattvam tapo brahma. Brahma also means the Absolute Truth. One has to
cultivate knowledge of the Absolute Truth by pursuing studies in the
Vedas and undergoing severe austerities and penances. The Pracetas
properly executed this function and consequently became equal to all
other living entities. As Bhagavad-gita confirms:
brahma-bhiitah prasannatma
na socati na kanksati
samah sarvesu bhiitesu
mad-bhaktitn labhate param
“One who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme
Brahman. He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally
disposed to every living entity. In that state he attains pure devotional
service unto Me.” (Bg. 18.54)
When one actually becomes spiritually advanced, he does not see the


--- Page 421 ---
1558 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 31
difference between one living entity and another. This platform is attained
by determination. When perfect knowledge is expanded, one ceases to see
the outward covering of the living entity. He sees, rather, the spirit soul
within the body. Thus he does not make distinctions between a human
being and an animal, a learned brahmana and a candala.

“The humble sage, by virtue of true knowledge, sees with equal vision a
learned and gentle brahmana, a cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater
[outcaste].” (Bg. 5.18)

A learned person sees everyone equally on a spiritual basis, and a learned
person, a devotee, wants to see everyone developed in Krsna consciousness.
The place where the Pracetas were residing was perfect for executing spiri-
tual activities, for it is indicated that the great sage Jajali attained mukti
(liberation) there. One desiring perfection or liberation should associate
with a person who is already liberated. This is called sadhu-sariga, associating
with a perfect devotee.

TRANSLATION

After practicing the yogasana for mystic yoga, the Pracetas managed to
control their life air, mind, words and external vision. Thus by the
pranayama process they were completely relieved of material attachment.
By remaining perpendicular, they could concentrate their minds on the
uppermost Brahman. While they were practicing this pranayama, the great
sage Narada, who is worshiped both by demons and by demigods, came to
see them.

PURPORT

In this verse the words pare amale are significant. The realization of
Brahman is explained in Srimad-Bhagavatam. The Absolute Truth is
realized in three phases—impersonal effulgence (Brahman), localized
Paramatma and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Bhagavan. In his
prayers, Lord Siva concentrated upon the personal features of Parabrahman,
described in personal terms as snigdha-pravrd-ghana-Syamam (Bhag.
4.24.45). Following the instructions of Lord Siva, the Pracetas also con-
centrated their minds on the Syamasundara form of the Supreme Brahman.
Although impersonal Brahman, Paramatma Brahman and Brahman as the
Supreme Person are all on the same transcendental platform, the personal
feature of the Supreme Brahman is the ultimate goal and last word in
transcendence.

The great sage Narada travels everywhere. He goes to the demons and
the demigods and is equally respected. He is consequently described herein
as surdsuredya, worshiped both by demons and by demigods. For Narada
Muni, the door of every house is open. Although there is perpetual
animosity between the demons and demigods, Narada Muni is welcomed
everywhere. Narada is considered one of the demigods, of course, and the
word devarsi means ‘““the saintly person among the demigods.”” Not even
the demons envy Narada Muni; therefore he is equally worshiped both by
demons and by demigods. A perfect Vaisnava’s position should be just
like Narada Muni’s, completely independent and unbiased.

TRANSLATION
As soon as the Pracetas saw that the great sage Narada had appeared,
they immediately got up even from their asanas. As required, they im-
mediately offered obeisances and worshiped him, and when they saw that
Narada Muni was properly seated, they began to ask him questions.
PURPORT
It is significant that all the Pracetas were engaged in practicing yoga to
concentrate their minds on the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Text 6] Narada Instructs the Pracetas 1561
TRANSLATION
All the Pracetas began to address the great sage Narada: O great sage, O
brahmana, we hope you met with no disturbances while coming here. It is
due to our great fortune that we are now able tosee you. By the traveling
of the sun, people are relieved from the fear of the darkness of night—a
fear brought about by thieves and rogues. Similarly, your traveling is like
the sun’s, for you drive away all kinds of fear.
PURPORT
Because of the night’s darkness, everyone is afraid of rogues and thieves,
especially in great cities. People are often afraid to go out on the streets,
and we understand that even in a great city like New York people do not
like to go out at night. More or less, when it is night, everyone is afraid,
either in the city or in the village. However, as soon as the sun rises, every-
one is relieved. Similarly, this material world is dark by nature. Everyone
is afraid of danger at every moment, but when one sees a devotee like
Narada, all fear is relieved. Just as the sun disperses darkness, the appearance
of a great sage like Narada disperses ignorance. When one meets Narada or
his representative, a spiritual master, he is freed from all anxiety brought
about by ignorance.

1562 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 31
PURPORT
Remaining in family life is a kind of concession for sense enjoyment.
One should know that sense enjoyment is not required, but one has to
accept sense enjoyment inasmuch as one has to live. As confirmed in
Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.10): kamasya nendriya-pritih. One has to become
a gosvami and control his senses. One should not simply use his senses for
sense gratification; rather, the senses should be employed just as much as
required for maintaining body and soul together. Srila Riipa Gosvami
recommends: andsaktasya visayan yatharham upayuiijatah. One should not
be attached to sense objects but should accept sense enjoyment as much
as required, no more. If one wishes to enjoy the senses more than required,
he becomes attached to family life, which means bondage. All the Pracetas
admitted their fault in remaining in household life.

rial existence.
PURPORT
The Pracetas requested Narada to enlighten them in transcendental
knowledge. Generally when a common man meets a saintly person, he
wishes to get some material benediction. However, the Pracetas were not
interested in material benefit, for they had enjoyed all this sufficiently.


--- Page 426 ---
Text 8] Narada Instructs the Pracetas 1563
Nor did they want the fulfillment of their material desires. They were
simply interested in crossing the ocean of nescience. Everyone should be
interested in getting out of these material clutches. Everyone should ap-
proach a saintly person in order to be enlightened in this connection. One
should not bother a saintly person to get blessings for material enjoyment.
Generally householders receive saintly persons to get their blessings, but
their real aim is to become happy in the material world. Asking such ma-
terial benedictions is not recommended in the 5661705.

The great sage Maitreya continued: My dear Vidura, being thus peti-

sorbed in thoughts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, began to reply.
PURPORT
In this verse bhagavan naradah indicates that Narada is always absorbed
in thoughts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Bhagavaty uttama-
Sloka avistatma. Narada has no other business than thinking of Krsna,
talking of Krsna and preaching about Krsna; therefore he is sometimes
called bhagavdn. Bhagavan means “one who possesses all opulences.” When
a person possesses Bhagavan within his heart, he is also sometimes called


--- Page 427 ---
1564 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 31
bhagavan. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura said, saksad-dharitvena
samasta-$astraih: in every $astra the spiritual master is accepted directly as
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This does not mean that the spiritual
master or a saintly person like Narada has actually become the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, but he is accepted in this way because he pos-
sesses the Supreme Personality of Godhead within his heart constantly.
As described here (@vistatma), when one is simply absorbed in the thought
of Krsna, he is also called bhagavan. Bhagavan possesses all opulence. If
one possesses Bhagavan within his heart always, does he not automatically
possess all opulence also? In that sense a great devotee like Narada can be
called bhagavan. However, we cannot tolerate when a rascal or imposter is
called bhagavan. One must possess either all opulences or the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Bhagavan, who possesses all opulences.

The great sage Narada said: When a living entity is born to engage in the
devotional service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the
supreme controller, his birth, all his fruitive activities, his lifespan, his mind
and his words are all factually perfect.
PURPORT
In this verse the word nrpam is very important. There are many other
births besides human birth, but Narada Muni is herein especially speaking


--- Page 428 ---
Text 10] Narada Instructs the Pracetas 1565
of human birth. Amongst human beings there are different types of men.
Of these, those who are advanced in spiritual consciousness or Krsna con-
sciousness are called Aryans. Amongst Aryans, one who engages in the
devotional service of the Lord is most successful in life. The word nrpam
indicates that lower animals do not engage in the devotional service of the
Lord. In perfect human society everyone should engage in the devotional
service of the Lord. It does not matter whether one is born poor or rich,
black or white. There may be so many material distinctions for one who
takes birth in human society, but everyone should engage in the Lord’s
devotional service. At the present moment civilized nations have given up
God consciousness for economic development. They are actually no longer
interested in advancing in God consciousness. Formerly their forefathers
were engaged in executing religious principles. Whether one is Hindu,
Moslem, Buddhist, Jewish or whatever, everyone has some religious insti-
tution. Real religion, however, means becoming God conscious. It is par-
ticularly mentioned herein that birth is successful if an interest in Krsna
consciousness is taken. Activity is successful if it results in serving the
Lord. Philosophical speculation or mental speculation is successful when
engaged in understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The senses
are worth possessing when engaged in the service of the Lord. Actually,
devotional service means engaging the senses in the service of the Lord.
At the present moment our senses are not purified; therefore our senses
are engaged in the service of society, friendship, love, politics, sociology,
and so on. However, when the senses are engaged in the service of the
Lord, one attains bhakti, or devotional service. In the next verse these
matters will be more clearly explained.

When one great devotee of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu saw the Lord, he
said that all his desires were fulfilled. He said, “Today everything is auspi-
cious. Today my birthplace and neighborhood are completely glorified.
Today my senses, from my eyes down to my toes, are fortunate. Today
my life is successful because I have been able to see the lotus feet that are
worshiped by the goddess of fortune.”

TRANSLATION

A civilized human being has three kinds of births. The first birth is by a
pure father and mother, and this birth is called birth by semina. The next
birth takes place when one is initiated by the spiritual master, and this birth
is called savitra. The third birth, called yajiika, takes place when one is
given the opportunity to worship Lord Vignu. Despite the opportunities
for attaining such births, even if one gets the lifespan of a demigod, if one
does not actually engage in the service of the Lord, everything is useless.
Similarly, one’s activities may be mundane or spiritual, but they are useless
if they are not meant for satisfying the Lord.

PURPORT

The word Saukra-janma means taking birth by seminal discharge. Ani-
mals can take their birth in this way too. However, a human being can be
reformed from the Saukra-janma, as recommended in the Vedic civilization.
Before the birth takes place, or before father and mother unite, there is a
ceremony called garbhadhana-sariskara, which must be adopted. This
garbhadhana-sariskara is especially recommended for higher castes, espe-
cially the brahmana caste. It is said in the $astras that if the garbhadhana-
samskara is not practiced amongst the higher castes, the entire family be-
comes Sidra. It is also stated that in this age of Kali, everyone is siidra due
to the absence of the garbhadhana-samskara. This is the Vedic system.
According to the paficaratrika system, however, even though everyone is a
Sidra due to the absence of the garbhadhana-samskara, if a person has but
alittle tendency to become Krsna conscious, he should be given the chance
to elevate himself to the transcendental platform of devotional service.
Our Krsna consciousness movement adopts this paicaratrika-vidhi, as ad-
vised by Srila Sanatana Gosvami, who says:

Yyatha kaficanatarm yati
karsyam rasa-vidhanatah


--- Page 430 ---

“As bell-metal, when mixed with mercury, is transformed to gold, a per-
son, even though not golden pure, can be transformed into a brahmana or
dvija simply by the initiation process.”” Thus if one is initiated by a proper
person, he can be accepted as twice-born immediately. In our Krsna con-
sciousness movement, we therefore offer the student his first initiation and
allow him to chant the Hare Krsna mahd-mantra. By chanting the Hare
Krsna maha mantra regularly and following the regulative principles, one
becomes qualified to be initiated as a brdhmana because unless one is a
qualified brahmana he cannot be allowed to worship Lord 12100. This is
called ydjitika-janma. In our Krsna consciousness society, unless one is
twice initiated—first by chanting Hare Krsna and second by the Gayatri
mantra—he is not allowed to enter the kitchen or Deity room to execute
duties. However, when one is elevated to the platform on which he can
worship the Deity, his previous birth does not matter.

“Even if one is born in the family of a candala, if one engages in the devo-
tional service of the Lord, he becomes the best of brahmanas. But even a
brahmana who is devoid of devotional service is on the level of the lowest
dog-eater.”

If a person is advanced in devotional service, it does not matter whether
he was born in a canddla family. He becomes purified. As Sri Prahlada
মি viprad dvisad-guna-yutad aravinda-nabha-

padaravinda-vimukhdac chvapacam varistham

(Bhag. 7.9.10)
Even if one is a brahmana and is qualified with all the brahminical qualifi-
cations, he is considered degraded if he is averse to worshiping the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. But if a person is attached to the service
of the Lord, he becomes glorified even if he is born in a candala family.
Indeed, such a canddla can deliver not only himself but all his family pre-
decessors. Without devotional service, even a proud brahmana cannot de-
liver himself, and what to speak of his family. In many instances in the
Sastras it is seen that even a brahmana has become a ksatriya, vaiSya, sidra,
mleccha or non-brahmanpa. And there are many instances of one’s being


--- Page 431 ---
1568 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 31
born a ksatriya or vaiSya or even lower, and, in the eighteenth year, attain-
ing elevation to the brahminical platform by the process of initiation.
Therefore Narada Muni says:
yasya yal laksanam proktam
puriso varnabhivyaijakam
yad anyatrapi drsyeta
tat tenaiva vinirdiset (Bhag. 7.11.35)
It is not a fact that because one is born in a brahmana family he is auto-
matically a brahmana. He has a better chance to become a brahmana, but
unless he meets all the brahminical qualifications, he cannot be accepted as
such. On the other hand, if the brahminical qualifications are found in the
person of a $iidra, he should immediately be accepted as a brahmana. To
substantiate this there are many quotations from Bhagavatam, Mahabharata,
Bharadvdja-samhita and the Paficardtra, as well as many other scriptures.
As far as the duration of life of the demigods, concerning Lord Brahma
it is said:
sahasra-yuga-paryantam
ahar yad brahmano viduh
ratrirm yuga-sahasrantam
te ’ho-ratra-vido janah (Bg. 8.17)
The duration of one day of Brahma is one thousand times greater than the
four yugas aggregating to 4,300,000 years. Similarly, Brahma’s one night.
Brahma lives for one hundred years of such days and nights. The word
vibudhayusa indicates that even if one gets a long life span, his life span 15
useless if he is not a devotee. A living entity is the eternal servitor of the
Supreme Lord, and unless he comes to the platform of devotional service,
his life span, good birth, glorious activities and everything else are null and
void.

TRANSLATION

Without devotional service, what is the meaning of severe austerities,
the process of hearing, the power of speech, the power of mental specu-
lation, elevated intelligence, strength and the power of the senses?

PURPORT
From the Upanisads we learn:
ndyam dtma pravacanena labhyo
na medhaya na bahuna srutena
yam evaisa vrnute tena labhyas
tasyaisa atma vivrnute tanim svam
(Mundaka Upanisad 3.2.3)
Our relationship with the Supreme Lord is never advanced by simple
study of the Vedas. There are many Mayavadi sannydasis fully engaged in
studying the Vedas, Vedanta-sitra and Upanisads, but unfortunately they
cannot grasp the real essence of knowledge. In other words, they do not
know the Supreme Personality of Godhead. What, then, is the use in studying
all the Vedas, if one cannot grasp the essence of the Vedas, Krsna? The
Lord confirms in Bhagavad-gita, vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah: “By
all the Vedas, I am to be known.” (Bg. 15.15)

There are many religious systems wherein penances and austerities are
greatly stressed, but at the end no one understands Krsna, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. There is therefore no point in such penance
(tapasya). If one has actually approached the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, he does not need to undergo severe austerities. The Supreme
Personality of Godhead is understood through the process of devotional
service. In the Ninth Chapter of Bhagavad-gita devotional service is ex-
plained as raja-guhyam, the king of all confidential knowledge. There are
many good reciters of Vedic literatures, and they recite works such as the
Ramayana, Srimad-Bhagavatam and Bhagavad-gita. Sometimes these pro-
fessional readers manifest very good scholarship and exhibit word jugglery.
Unfortunately they are never devotees of the Supreme Lord. Consequently


--- Page 433 ---
1570 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 31
they cannot impress upon the audience the real essence of knowledge,
Krsna. There are also many thoughtful writers and creative philosophers,
but despite all their learning, if they cannot approach the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead, they are simply useless mental speculators. There are
many sharply intelligent people in this material world, and they discover
so many things for sense gratification. They also analytically study all the
material elements, but despite their expert knowledge and expert scien-
tific analysis of the whole cosmic manifestation, their endeavors are
useless because they cannot understand the Supreme Personality of God-
head.

As far as our senses are concerned, there are many animals, both beasts
and birds, who are very expert in exercising their senses more keenly than
human beings. For example, vultures or hawks can go very high in the sky
but can see a small body on the ground very clearly. This means that their
eyesight is so keen that they can find an eatable corpse from a great
distance. Certainly their eyesight is much keener than human beings’, but
this does not mean that their existence is more important than that of a
human being. Similarly, dogs can smell many things from a far distance.
Many fish can understand by the power of sound that an enemy is coming.
All these examples are described in Srimad-Bhagavatam. If one’s senses
cannot help him attain the highest perfection of life, realization of the
Supreme, they are all useless.

TRANSLATION
Transcendental practices that do not ultimately help one realize the

Supreme Personality of Godhead are useless, be they mystic yoga prac-
tices, the analytical study of matter, severe austerity, the acceptance of
sannya3sa, or the study of Vedic literature. All these may be very important
aspects of spiritual advancement, but unless one understands the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Hari, all these processes are useless.

PURPORT

In Caitanya-caritamrta it is said:
bhakti vina kevala jiane ‘mukti’ nahi haya
bhakti sadhana kare yei ‘prapta-brahmalaya’

(Cc. Madhya 24.109)
Impersonalists do not take to devotional service but take to other practices,
such as the analytical study of the material elements, the discrimination
between matter and spirit, and the mystic yoga system. These are beneficial
only insofar as they are complementary to devotional service. Caitanya
Mahaprabhu therefore told Sanatana Gosvami that without a touch of
devotional service, jiana, yoga and sainkhya philosophy cannot give one
the desired results. The impersonalists wish to merge into the Supreme
Brahman; however, merging into the Supreme Brahman also requires a
touch of devotional service. The Absolute Truth is realized in three phases—
impersonal Brahman, Paramatma and the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
All these require a touch of devotional service. Sometimes it is actually
seen that these Mayavadis also chant the Hare Krsna maha-mantra, although
their motive is to merge into the Brahman effulgence of the Absolute.
The yogis also at times take to chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra, but
their purpose is different from that of the bhaktas. In all processes—
karma, jana or yoga—bhakti is required. That is the purport of this
verse.

TRANSLATION

Factually the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the original source of
all self-realization. Consequently the goal of all auspicious activities—karma,
jnana, yoga and bhakti—is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

PURPORT

The living entity is the marginal energy of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, and the material world is the external energy. Under the circum-
stances, one must understand that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is
factually the original source of both matter and spirit. This is explained in
the Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-gita:

bhimir apo 71000 vayuh
kharir mano buddhir eva ca
ahankara itiyam me
bhinna prakrtir astadha
apareyam itas tv anyam
[01701018877 viddhi me param

“Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego—all together
these eight comprise My separated material energies. Besides this inferior
nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is a superior energy of Mine, which
consists of all living entities who are struggling with material nature and
are sustaining the universe.” (Bg. 7.4-5)

The entire cosmic manifestation is but a combination of matter and
spirit. The spiritual part is the living entity, and these living entities are
described as prakrti, or energy. The living entity is never described as
purusa, the Supreme Person; therefore to identify the living entity with


--- Page 436 ---
Text 14] Narada Instructs the Pracetas 1573
the Supreme Lord is simply ignorance. The living entity is the marginal
potency of the Supreme Lord, although there is factually no difference
between the energy and the energetic. The duty of the living entity is to
understand his real identity. When he does, Krsna gives him all the facilities
to come to the platform of devotional service. That is the perfection of
life. This is indicated in the Vedic Upanisad:
yam evaisa vrnute tena labhyas
tasyaisa atma vivrnute tani svam
Lord Krsna confirms this in Bhagavad-gita:
tesam satata-yuktanam
bhajatam priti-pirvakam
dadami buddhi-yogarh tam
yena mam upayanti te
“To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give
the understanding by which they can come to Me.” (Bg. 10.10) The con-
clusion is that one must come to the platform of bhakti-yoga, even though
one may begin with karma-yoga, jidna-yoga or astanga-yoga. Unless one
comes to the platform of bhakti-yoga, self-realization or realization of the
Absolute Truth cannot be achieved.

TRANSLATION

As pouring water on the root of a tree energizes the trunk, branches,
twigs and everything else, and as supplying food to the stomach enlivens
the senses and limbs of the body, so simply worshiping the Supreme
Personality of Godhead through devotional service automatically satisfies
the demigods, who are parts of that Supreme Personality.

PURPORT

Sometimes people ask why this Krsna consciousness movement simply
advocates worship of Krsna to the exclusion of the demigods. The answer
is given in this verse. The example of pouring water on the root of a tree is
very appropriate. In Bhagavad-gita it is said:

अ bhagavan uvdca
ardhva-milam adhah-sakham
asvattham prahur avyayam
chandarsi yasya parpani
yas tam veda sa veda-vit
“The blessed Lord said: There is a banyan tree that has its roots upward
and its branches down and whose leaves are the Vedic hymns. One who
knows this tree is the knower of the Vedas.” (Bg. 15.1)
This cosmic manifestation has expanded downward and the root is the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. As the Lord confirms in Bhagavad-gita:
aham sarvasya prabhavo
mattah sarvam pravartate
iti matva bhajante mam
budha bhava-samanvitah
“I am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates
from Me. The wise who perfectly know this engage in My devotional
service and worship Me with all their hearts.” (Bg. 10.8)

Krsna is the root of everything; therefore rendering service to the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna (krsna-sevd), means automatically
serving all the demigods. Sometimes it is argued that karma and jidna
require a mixture of bhakti in order to be successfully executed, and
sometimes it is argued that bhakti also requires karma and jiidna for its


--- Page 438 ---
Text 15] Narada Instructs the Pracetas 1575
successful termination. The fact is, however, that although karma and
jana cannot be successful without bhakti, bhakti does not require the
help of karma and jiigna. Actually, as described by Srila Riipa Gosvami,
anyabhilasita-sinyar jidana-karmady-anavrtam: pure devotional service
should not be contaminated by the touch of karma and jiana. Modern
society is involved in various types of philanthropic works, humanitarian
works, and so on, but people do not know that these activities will never
be successful unless Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is brought
into the center. One may ask what harm there is in worshiping Krsna and
the different parts of His body, the demigods, and the answer is also given
in this verse. The point is that by supplying food to the stomach, the
indriyas, the senses, are automatically satisfied. If one tries to feed his
eyes or ears independently, the result is only havoc. Simply by supplying
food to the stomach, we satisfy all of the senses. It is neither necessary
nor feasible to render separate service to the individual senses. The con-
clusion is that by serving Krsna (krsna-seva), everything is complete. As
confirmed in Caitanya-caritamrta: krsne bhakti kaile sarva-karma krta
haya (Cc. Madhya 22.62). If one is engaged in the devotional service of the
Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, everything is automatically
accomplished.

TRANSLATION

During the rainy season, water is generated from the sun, and in due
course of time, during the summer season, the very same water is again
absorbed by the sun. Similarly, all living entities, moving and inert, are
generated from the earth, and again, after some time, they all return to the
earth as dust. Similarly, everything emanates from the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, and in due course of time everything enters into Him again.

PURPORT

Because of their poor fund of knowledge, impersonalist philosophers
cannot understand how everything comes out from the Supreme Person
and then merges into Him again. As Brahma-sarihita confirms:

yasya prabhd prabhavato jagad-anda-koti-
kotisv asesa-vasudhadi-vibhiti-bhinnam
tad brahma niskalam anantam asesa-bhiitari
govindam adi-purusari tam ahari bhajami
(Bs. 5.40)
Transcendental rays emanate from the body of Krsna, and within those
rays, which are the Brahman effulgence, everything is existing. This is
confirmed in Bhagavad-gita. Mat-sthani sarva-bhiitani (Bg. 9.4).

Although Krsna is not personally present everywhere, His energy is
nonetheless the cause of all creation. The entire cosmic manifestation is
nothing but a display of Krsna’s energy. The two examples given in this
verse are very vivid. During the rainy season, the rain, by rejuvenating the
production of vegetables on earth, enables man and animals to obtain
living energy. When there is no rain, food is scarce, and man and animal
simply die. All vegetables, as well as moving living entities, are originally
products of the earth. They come from the earth, and again they merge
into the earth. Similarly, the total material energy is generated from the
body of Krsna, and at such a time the entire cosmic manifestation is
visible. When Krsna winds up His energy, everything vanishes. This is
explained in a different way in Brahma-santhita:

yasyaika-niSvasita-kalam athavalambya
jivanti loma-vilaja jagad-anda-nathah
vispur mahdan sa tha yasya kald-viseso
govindam adi-purusari tam ahari bhajami
(Bs. 5.48)

Text 16] Narada Instructs the Pracetas 1577
This entire material creation comes from the body of the Supreme Person-
ality of Godhead and at the time of annihilation again enters into Him.
This process of creation and dissolution is made possible by the breathing
of the Maha-Visnu, who is only a plenary portion of Krsna.

TRANSLATION
Just as the sunshine is nondifferent from the sun, the cosmic manifesta-
tion is also nondifferent from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The
Supreme Personality is therefore all-pervasive within this material creation.
When the senses are active, they appear to be part and parcel of the body,
but when the body is asleep, their activities are unmanifest. Similarly, the
whole cosmic creation appears different and yet nondifferent from the
Supreme Person.
PURPORT
This confirms the philosophy of acintya-bhedabheda-tattva (simulta-
neously one and different) propounded by Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is simultaneously different and non-


--- Page 441 ---
1578 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 31
different from this cosmic manifestation. In the previous verse it has been
explained that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as the root of a tree,
is the original cause of everything. It was also explained how the Supreme
Personality of Godhead is all-pervasive. He is present within everything in
this material manifestation. Since the energy of the Supreme Lord is non-
different from Him, this material cosmic manifestation is also nondifferent
from Him, although it appears different. The sunshine is not different
from the sun itself, but it is simultaneously also different. One may be in
the sunshine, but he is not on the sun itself. Those who live in this material
world are living on the bodily rays of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
but they cannot see Him personally in the material condition.

In this verse the word padam indicates the place where the Supreme
Personality of Godhead resides. As confirmed in 140100105৫0, i$avasyam
ida sarvam. The proprietor of a house may live in one room of the house.
but the entire house belongs to him. A king may live in one room in
Buckingham Palace, but the entire palace is considered his property. It is
not necessary for the king to live in every room of that palace for it to be
his. He may be physically absent from the rooms, but still the entire
palace is understood to be his royal domicile.

The sunshine is light, the sun globe itself is light, and the sun-god is also
light. However, the sunshine is not identical with the sun-god, Vivasvan.
This is the meaning of simultaneously one and different (acintya-
bhedabheda-tattva). All the planets rest on the sunshine, and because of
the heat of the sun, they all revolve in their orbits. On each and every
planet, the trees and plants grow and change colors due to the sunshine.
Being the rays of the sun, the sunshine is nondifferent from the sun. Simi-
larly, all the planets, resting on the sunshine, are nondifferent from the
sun. The entire material world is completely dependent on the sun, being
produced by the sun, and the cause, the sun, is inherent in the effects.
Similarly, Krsna is the cause of all causes, and the effects are permeated
by the original cause. The entire cosmic manifestation should be under-
stood as the expanded energy of the Supreme Lord.

When one sleeps, the senses are inactive, but this does not mean that
the senses are absent. When one is awakened, the senses become active
again. Similarly, this cosmic creation is sometimes manifest and sometimes
unmanifest. As stated in Bhagavad-gita:

bhiita-gramah sa evayari
९८८८४८८ bhiitva praliyate

ratry-aggame ‘vasah partha
prabhavaty ahar-agame


--- Page 442 ---
Text 17] Narada Instructs the Pracetas 1579
“Again and again the day comes, and this host of beings is active, and
again the night falls, O Partha, and they are helplessly dissolved.” (Bg. 8.19)
When the cosmic manifestation is dissolved, it is in a kind of sleeping
condition, an inactive state. Whether the cosmic manifestation is active
or inactive, the energy of the Supreme Lord is always existing. Thus the
words ‘“‘appearance” and ‘‘disappearance” apply only to the cosmic mani-
festation.

modes of passion, darkness and goodness appear as consecutive energies.
Sometimes they appear, and sometimes they disappear.
PURPORT
Darkness, illumination and clouds sometimes appear and sometimes dis-
appear, but even when they have disappeared, the potency is still there,
always existing. In the sky sometimes we see clouds, sometimes rainfall
and sometimes snow. Sometimes we see night, sometimes day, sometimes
illumination and sometimes darkness. All these exist due to the sun, but


--- Page 443 ---
1580 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 31
the sun is unaffected by all these changes. Similarly, although the Supreme
Personality of Godhead is the original cause of the total cosmic manifesta-
tion, He is unaffected by the material existence. This is confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita:
bhamir apo 77100 vayuh
khari mano buddhir eva ca
ahankara itiyam me
bhinna prakrtir astadha
“Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego—all to-
gether these eight comprise My separated material energies.” (Bg. 7.4)

Although the material or physical elements are the energy of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, they are separate. The Supreme
Personality of Godhead is therefore not affected by material conditions.
The Vedanta-sitra confirms (janmady asya yatah) that the creation, main-
tenance and dissolution of this cosmic manifestation are due to the exist-
ence of the Supreme Lord. Nonetheless the Lord is unaffected by all these
changes in the material elements. This is indicated by the word praviha
(emanation). The sun always shines brilliantly and is not affected by
clouds or darkness. Similarly, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is al-
ways present in His spiritual energy and is not affected by the material
emanations. Brahma-sarihita confirms:

iSvarah paramah krsnah
sac-cid-ananda-vigrahah
anadir adir govindah
sarva-kdrana-karanam
“Krsna, who is known as Govinda, is the Supreme Godhead. He has an
eternal, blissful, spiritual body. He is the origin of all. He has no other
origin, and He is the prime cause of all causes.” (Bs. 5.1)

Although He is the supreme cause, the cause of all causes, He is still
parama, transcendental, and His form is sac-cid-ananda, eternal, spiritual
bliss. Krsna is the shelter of everything, and this is the verdict of all scrip-
ture. Krsna is the remote cause, and material nature is the immediate
cause of the cosmic manifestation. In the Caitanya-caritamrta it is said that
understanding prakrti, or nature, to be the cause of everything is like
understanding the nipples on the neck of a goat to be the cause of milk.
Material nature is the immediate cause of the cosmic manifestation, but
the original cause is Narayana, Krsna. Sometimes people think that the


--- Page 444 ---
Text 18] Narada Instructs the Pracetas 1581
cause of an earthen pot is the earth. We see on a potter’s wheel a sufficient
amount of earth to produce many pots, and although unintelligent men
will say that the earth on the wheel is the cause of the pot, those who are
actually advanced will find that the original cause is the potter, who
supplies the earth and moves the wheel. Material nature may be a helping
factor in the creation of this cosmic manifestation, but it is not the ulti-
mate cause. In Bhagavad-gita the Lord therefore says:
mayadhyaksena prakrtih
siiyate sa-caracaram

“This material nature is working under My direction, O son of Kunti, and
producing all moving and unmoving beings.” (Bg. 9.10)

The Supreme Lord casts His glance over material energy, and His glance
agitates the three modes of nature. Creation then takes place. The conclu-
sion is that nature is not the cause of the material manifestation. The
Supreme Lord is the cause of all causes.

TRANSLATION

Because the Supreme Lord is the cause of all causes, He is the Supersoul
of all individual living entities, and He exists as both the remote and imme-
diate cause. Since He is aloof from the material emanations, He is free
from their interactions and is Lord of material nature. You should there-
fore engage in His devotional service, thinking yourself qualitatively one
with Him.

PURPORT

According to Vedic calculations, there are three causes of creation—
time, the ingredient and the creator. Combined, these are called
tritayatmaka, the three causes. Everything in this material world is created
by these three causes. All of these causes are found in the Personality of
Godhead. As confirmed in Brahma-sarihita: sarva-karana-karanam. Narada
Muni therefore advises the Pracetas to worship the direct cause, the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. As stated before, when the root of a
tree is watered, all the parts are energized. According to the advice of
Narada Muni, one should directly engage in devotional service. This will
include all pious activity. Caitanya-caritamrta states: krspe bhakti kaile
sarva-karma krta haya. When one worships the Supreme Lord Krsna in
devotional service, he automatically performs all other pious activity. In
this verse the words sva-tejasa dhvasta-guna-pravaham are very significant.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is never affected by the material
qualities, although they all emanate from His spiritual energy. Those who
are really conversant with this knowledge can utilize everything for the
service of the Lord because nothing in this material world is unconnected
to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION

By showing mercy to all living entities, being satisfied somehow or
other, and controlling the senses from sense enjoyment, one can very
quickly satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Janardana.

PURPORT

These are some of the ways in which the Supreme Personality of
Godhead can be satisfied by the devotee. The first item mentioned is
dayaya sarva-bhiitesu, showing mercy to all conditioned souls. The best
way to show mercy is to spread Krsna consciousness. The entire world is
suffering for want of this knowledge. People should know that the Supreme
Personality of Godhead is the original cause of everything. Knowing this,
everyone should directly engage in His devotional service. Those who are
actually learned, advanced in spiritual understanding, should preach Krsna
consciousness all over the world so that people may take to it and make
their lives successful.

The word sarva-bhatesu is significant because it applies not only to
human beings but to all the living entities appearing in the 8,400,000
species of life. The devotee can do good not only to humanity but to all
living entities as well. Everyone can benefit spiritually by the chanting of
the Hare Krsna maha-mantra. When the transcendental vibration of Hare
Krsna is sounded, even the trees, animals and insects benefit. Thus when
one chants the Hare Krsna mahd-mantra loudly, he actually shows mercy
to all living entities. To spread the Krsna consciousness movement through-
out the world, the devotees should be satisfied in all conditions.

head. To attain this state, one has to control his senses. The senses are
automatically controlled when one’s mind is engaged in the service of the
Lord.

TRANSLATION
Being completely cleansed of all material desires, the devotees are freed
from all mental contamination. Thus they can always think of the Lord
constantly and address Him very feelingly. The Supreme Personality of
Godhead, knowing Himself to be controlled by His devotees, does not
leave them for a second, just as the sky overhead never becomes invisible.
PURPORT
It is clear from the previous verse that the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Janardana, is very quickly satisfied by the activities of His de-
votees. The pure devotee is always absorbed in the thought of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. As stated, §rnvatari sva-kathah krspah. By always
thinking of Krsna, the pure devotee’s heart is freed from all kinds of
desires. In the material world, the heart of the living entity is filled with
material desires. When the living entity is cleansed, he does not think of
anything material. As the mind is completely cleansed, one attains the


--- Page 448 ---
Text 21] Narada Instructs the Pracetas 1585
perfectional stage of mystic yoga, for then the yogi always sees the
Supreme Personality of Godhead within his heart. As soon as the Lord is
seated within the heart of the devotee, the devotee cannot be contaminated
by the material modes of nature. As long as one is under the control of the
material modes, he desires so many things and makes so many plans for
material sense enjoyment. As soon as the Lord is perceived in the heart,
all material desires vanish. When the mind is completely free from material
desire, the devotee can think of the Lord constantly. In this way he be-
comes completely dependent upon the lotus feet of the Lord. Caitanya
Mahaprabhu prays:
ayi nanda-tanuja 10170070718
patitam mari visame bhavambudhau
krpaya tava pada-parikaja-
sthita-dhiili-sadrsam vicintaya
“My dear Lord, I am Your eternal servant, but somehow or other I have
fallen into the ocean of this material world. Kindly pick me up and fix me
as a speck of dust at Your lotus feet.” Similarly, Srila Narottama dasa
Thakura prays:
ha ha prabhu nanda-suta, vrsabhanu-sutd-yuta,
karund karaha ei-bdra
narottama-dasa kaya, nd theliha raiga-paya,
toma vine ke ache amdra
“My dear Lord, You are now present with the daughter of King
Vrsabhanu, Srimati Radharani. Now both of You please be merciful
upon me. Don’t kick me away, because I have no shelter other than You.”
In this way the Supreme Personality of Godhead becomes dependent
on His devotee. The Lord is invincible, yet He is conquered by His pure
devotee. He enjoys being dependent on His devotee, just as Krsna enjoyed
being dependent on the mercy of mother Yasoda. Thinking Himself de-
pendent on the devotee gives the Supreme Lord great enjoyment. Some-
times a king may engage a joker, and in the process of joking, the king is
sometimes insulted. The king, however, enjoys these activities. Everyone
worships the Supreme Lord with great reverence; therefore the Lord some-
times wants to enjoy the chastisement of His devotees. In this way the
relationship eternally existing between the Lord and His devotees is fixed,
just like the sky overhead.

TRANSLATION
The Supreme Personality of Godhead becomes very dear to those de-
votees who have no material possessions but are fully happy in possessing
the devotional service of the Lord. Indeed, the Lord relishes the devotional
activities of such devotees. Those who are puffed up with material educa-
tion, wealth, aristocracy and fruitive activity are very proud of possessing
material things, and they often deride the devotees. Even if such people
offer the Lord worship, the Lord never accepts them.
PURPORT
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is dependent on His pure devotees.
He does not even accept the offerings of those who are not devotees. A
pure devotee is one who feels He does not possess anything material. A
devotee is always happy in possessing the devotional service of the Lord.
Devotees may sometimes appear materially poor, but because they are
spiritually advanced and enriched, they are most dear to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Such devotees are free from attachment to family,
society, friendship, children and so on. They abandon affection for all
these material possessions and are always happy in possessing the shelter
of the lotus feet of the Lord. The Supreme Personality of Godhead under-
stands the position of His devotee. If a person derides a pure devotee, he
is never recognized by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In other
words, the Supreme Lord never excuses one who offends a pure devotee.

There are many examples of this in history. A great mystic yogi, Durvasa
Muni, offended the great devotee Ambarisa Maharaja. The great sage
Durvasa was to be chastised by the Sudaréana cakra of the Lord. Even
though the great mystic directly approached the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, he was never excused. Those on the path of liberation should
be very careful not to offend a pure devotee.

udvisrjet— can give up; puman— a person; krta-jiah— grateful.
TRANSLATION
Although the Supreme Personality of Godhead is self-sufficient, He be-
comes dependent on His devotees. He does not care for the goddess of
fortune, nor for the kings and demigods who are after the favors of the
goddess of fortune. Where is that person who is actually grateful and will
not worship the Personality of Godhead?
PURPORT
Laksmi, the goddess of fortune, is worshiped by all materialistic men,
including big kings and demigods in heaven. Laksmi, however, is always
after the Supreme Personality of Godhead, even though He does not re-
quire her service. Brahma-sarnhita says that the Lord is worshiped by


--- Page 451 ---
1588 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 31
hundreds and thousands of goddesses of fortune, but the Supreme Lord
does not require service from any of them because if He so desires He can
produce millions of goddesses of fortune through His spiritual energy, the
pleasure potency. This very Personality of Godhead, out of His causeless
mercy, becomes dependent on the devotees. How fortunate, then, is a devo-
tee who is thus favored by the Personality of Godhead. What ungrateful
devotee will not worship the Lord and enter into His devotional service?
Actually a devotee cannot forget his obligation to the Supreme Personality
of Godhead even for a single moment. Srila Vi§vanatha Cakravarti Thakura
says that both the Supreme Lord and His devotee are rasa-jiia, full of tran-
scendental humor. The mutual attachment between the Supreme Lord and
His devotee is never to be considered material. It always exists as a tran-
scendental fact. There are eight types of transcendental ecstasy (known as
bhava, anubhava, sthayibhava and so on), and these are discussed in The
Nectar of Devotion. Those who are unaware of the position of the living
entity and the Supreme Person, Krsna, think that the mutual attachment
between the Lord and His devotees is a creation of the material energy.
Factually such attachment is natural both for the Supreme Lord and for
the devotee, and it cannot be accepted as material.

TRANSLATION
The great sage Maitreya continued: My dear King Vidura, Sri Narada
Muni, the son of Lord Brahma, thus described all these relationships with
the Supreme Personality of Godhead to the Pracetas. Afterwards, he re-
turned to Brahmaloka.
PURPORT
One has to hear about the Supreme Personality of Godhead from a pure
devotee. The Pracetas got this opportunity from the great sage Narada,
who told them of the activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead
and His devotees.

TRANSLATION
Hearing from Narada’s mouth the glories of the Lord, which vanquish
all the ill fortune of the world, they also became attached to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Meditating on His lotus feet, they advanced to
the ultimate destination.
PURPORT
Here it is seen that by hearing the glories of the Lord from a realized
devotee the Pracetas easily attained strong attachment for the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Then, meditating on the lotus feet of the Supreme
Lord at the end of their lives, they advanced to the ultimate goal, Visnu-
loka. It is sure and certain that anyone who always hears the glories of the

1590 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 4, Ch. 31
Lord and thinks of His lotus feet will reach that supreme destination. As
Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita:
man-mand bhava mad-bhakto
mad-ydji mam namas-kuru
mam evaigyasi satyam te
pratijane priyo ’si me
“Always think of Me and become My devotee. Worship Me and offer your
homage unto Me. Thus you will come to me without fail. I promise you
this because you are My very dear friend.” (Bg. 18.65)

My dear Vidura, I have told you everything you wanted to know about
the conversation between Narada and the Pracetas, the conversation de-
scribing the glories of the Lord. I have related this as far as possible.

PURPORT

Srimad-Bhagavatam describes the glories of the Lord and His devotees.
Because the whole subject matter is the glorification of the Lord, natu-
rally the glorification of His devotees automatically follows.

PURPORT
Dhruva Maharaja was the son of King Uttanapada, and as far as the
descendants of Dhruva Maharaja or King Uttanapada are concerned, their
activities are described up to the point of the Pracetas. Now Sri Sukadeva
Gosvami desires to describe the descendants of Maharaja Priyavrata, the
second son of Svayambhuva Manu.

My dear King, in this way, after hearing the transcendental messages of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His devotees from the great sage
Maitreya, Vidura was overwhelmed with ecstasy. With tears in his eyes,

Text 29] Narada Instructs the Pracetas 1593
he immediately fell down at the lotus feet of his guru, his spiritual master.
He then fixed the Supreme Personality of Godhead within the core of his
heart.
PURPORT
This is a sign of associating with great devotees. A devotee takes instruc-
tions from a liberated soul and is thus overwhelmed by ecstasy from tran-
scendental pleasure. As stated by Prahlada Maharaja:
naisarn matis tavad urukramanghrim
sprsaty anarthapagamo yad-arthah
mahiyasam pada-rajo *bhisekam
niskificananam na vrnita yavat (Bhag. 7.5.32)
One cannot become a perfect devotee of the Lord without having
touched the lotus feet of a great devotee. One who has nothing to do with
this material world is called niskificana. The process of self-realization and
the path home, back to Godhead, means surrendering to the bona fide
spiritual master and taking the dust of his lotus feet on one’s head. Thus
one advances on the path of transcendental realization. Vidura had this
relationship with Maitreya, and he attained the results.

Sri Vidura said: O great mystic, O greatest of all devotees, by your
causeless mercy I have been shown the path of liberation from this world
of darkness. By following this path, a person liberated from the material
world can return home, back to Godhead.
PURPORT
This material world is called tamah, dark, and the spiritual world is
called light. The Vedas enjoin that everyone should try to get out of the
darkness and go to the kingdom of light. Information of that kingdom of
light can be attained through the mercy of a self-realized soul. One also
has to get rid of all material desires. As soon as one frees himself from
material desires and associates with a liberated person, the path back
home, back to Godhead, is clear.

great sage Maitreya, and, taking his permission, started for the city of
Hastinapura to see his own kinsmen, although he had no material desires.

Text 31] Narada Instructs the Pracetas 1595
PURPORT

When a saintly person wants to see his kinsmen, he has no material de-
sire to see them. He simply wants to give them some instructions so that
they can benefit. Vidura belonged to the royal family of the Kauravas,
and although he knew that all the family members were destroyed at the
Battle of Kuruksetra, he nonetheless wanted to see his elder brother,
Dhrtarastra, to see if he could deliver him from the clutches of maya.
When a great saintly person like Vidura sees his relatives, he desires only
to deliver them from the clutches of maya. Vidura thus offered his re-
spectful obeisances to his spiritual master and departed for the city of
Hastinapura, the kingdom of the Kauravas.

out difficulty a long life, wealth, good reputation, good fortune and,
ultimately, the opportunity to return home, back to Godhead.

Chapter of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “Narada Instructs the
Pracetas.”
