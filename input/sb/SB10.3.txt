Preface

We must know the present need of human society. And what is that
need? Human society is no longer bounded by geographical limits to par-
ticular countries or communities. Human society is broader than in the
Middle Ages, and the world tendency is toward one state or one human
society. The ideals of spiritual communism, according to Srimad-
Bhagavatam, are based more or less on the oneness of the entire human
society, nay, of the entire energy of living beings. The need is felt by
great thinkers to make this a successful ideology. Srimad-Bhagavatam
will fill this need in human society. It begins, therefore, with the apho-
rism of Vedanta philosophy janmady asya yatah to establish the ideal of
a common cause.

Human society, at the present moment, is not in the darkness of
oblivion. It has made rapid progress in the field of material comforts,
education and economic development throughout the entire world. But
there is a pinprick somewhere in the social body at large, and therefore
there are large-scale quarrels, even over less important issues. There is
need of a clue as to how humanity can become one in peace, friendship
and prosperity with a common cause. Srimad-Bhagavatam will fill this
need, for it is a cultural presentation for the respiritualization of the
entire human society.

Srimad-Bhagavatam should be introduced also in the schools and col-
leges, for it is recommended by the great student-devotee Prahlada
Maharaja in order to change the demoniac face of society.

Disparity in human society is due to lack of principles in a godless
civilization. There is God, or the Almighty One, from whom everything
emanates, by whom everything is maintained and in whom everything

is merged to rest. Material science has tried to find the ultimate
source of creation very insufficiently, but it is a fact that there is one
ultimate source of everything that be. This ultimate source is ex-
plained rationally and authoritatively in the beautiful Bhagavatam, or
Srimad-Bhagavatam.

Srimad-Bhagavatam is the transcendental science not only for know-
ing the ultimate source of everything but also for knowing our relation
with Him and our duty toward perfection of the human society on the
basis of this perfect knowledge. It is powerful reading matter in the
Sanskrit language, and it is now rendered into English elaborately so that
simply by a careful reading one will know God perfectly well, so much so
that the reader will be sufficiently educated to defend himself from the
onslaught of atheists. Over and above this, the reader will be able to con-
vert others to accepting God as a concrete principle.

Srimad-Bhagavatam begins with the definition of the ultimate source.
It is a bona fide commentary on the Vedanta-sitra by the same author,
Srila Vyasadeva, and gradually it develops into nine cantos up to the
highest state of God realization. The only qualification one needs to study
this great book of transcendental knowledge is to proceed step by step
cautiously and not jump forward haphazardly like with an ordinary
book. It should be gone through chapter by chapter, one after another.
The reading matter is so arranged with its original Sanskrit text, its
English transliteration, synonyms, translation and purports so that one is
sure to become a God-realized soul at the end of finishing the first nine
cantos.

The Tenth Canto is distinct from the first nine cantos because it deals
directly with the transcendental activities of the Personality of Godhead
Sri Krsna. One will be unable to capture the effects of the Tenth Canto
without going through the first nine cantos. The book is complete in
twelve cantos, each independent, but it is good for all to read them in
small installments one after another.

I must admit my frailties in presenting Srimad-Bhagavatam, but still
I am hopeful of its good reception by the thinkers and leaders of society
on the strength of the following statement of Srimad-Bhagavatam
(1.5.11);

tad-vag-visargo janatagha-viplavo
yasmin prati-§lokam abaddhavaty api

“On the other hand, that literature which is full with descriptions of the
transcendental glories of the name, fame, form and pastimes of the un-
limited Supreme Lord is a transcendental creation meant to bring about a
revolution in the impious life of a misdirected civilization. Such tran-
scendental literatures, even though irregularly composed, are heard,

sung and accepted by purified men who are thoroughly honest.”

Introduction

“This Bhagavata Purana is as brilliant as the sun, and it has arisen
just after the departure of Lord Krsna to His own abode, accompanied by
religion, knowledge, etc. Persons who have lost their vision due to the
dense darkness of ignorance in the age of Kali shall get light from this
Purana.” (Srimad-Bhagavatam 1.3.43)

The timeless wisdom of India is expressed in the Vedas, ancient
Sanskrit texts that touch upon all fields of human knowledge. Originally
preserved through oral tradition, the Vedas were first put into writing
five thousand years ago by Srila Vyasadeva, the “literary incarnation of
God.” After compiling the Vedas, Vyasadeva set forth their essence in
the aphorisms known as Vedanta-sitras. Srimad-Bhagavatam is Vyasa-
deva’s commentary on his own Vedanta-sitras. It was written in the
maturity of his spiritual life under the direction of Narada Muni, his
spiritual master. Referred to as “‘the ripened fruit of the tree of Vedic
literature,” Srimad-Bhagavatam is the most complete and authoritative
exposition of Vedic knowledge.

After compiling the Bhagavatam, Vyasa impressed the synopsis of it
upon his sun, the sage Sukadeva Gosvami. Sukadeva Gosvami subse-
quently recited the entire Bhagavatam to Maharaja Pariksit in an assem-
bly of learned saints on the bank of the Ganges at Hastinapura (now
Delhi). Maharaja Pariksit was the emperor of the world and was a great
rajarsi (saintly king). Having received a warning that he would die
within a week, he renounced his entire kingdom and retired to the bank
of the Ganges to fast until death and receive spiritual enlightenment.
The Bhagavatam begins with Emperor Pariksit’s sober inquiry to
Sukadeva Gosvami: ‘“You are the spiritual master of great saints and
devotees. I am therefore begging you to show the way of perfection for
all persons, and especially for one who is about to die. Please let me know
what a man should hear, chant, remember and worship, and also what he
should not do. Please explain all this to me.”

Sukadeva Gosvami’s answer to this question, and numerous other
questions posed by Maharaja Pariksit, concerning everything from the
nature of the self to the origin of the universe, held the assembled sages

xiii


--- Page 5 ---
xv Srimad-Bhagavatam

in rapt attention continuously for the seven days leading to the King’s
death. The sage Sita Gosvami, who was present on the bank of the
Ganges when Sukadeva Gosvami first recited Srimad-Bhagavatam,
later repeated the Bhagavatam before a gathering of sages in the forest
of Naimisaranya. Those sages, concerned about the spiritual welfare of
the people in general, had gathered to perform a long, continuous chain
of sacrifices to counteract the degrading influence of the incipient age of
Kali. In response to the sages’ request that he speak the essence of Vedic
wisdom, Sita Gosvami repeated from memory the entire eighteen thou-
sand verses of Srimad-Bhagavatam, as spoken by Sukadeva Gosvami to
Maharaja Pariksit.

The reader of Srimad-Bhagavatam hears Sita Gosvami relate the
questions of Maharaja Pariksit and the answers of Sukadeva Gosvami.
Also, Sata Gosvami sometimes responds directly to questions put by
Saunaka Rsi, the spokesman for the sages gathered at Naimisaranya. One
therefore simultaneously hears two dialogues: one between Maharaja
Pariksit and Sukadeva Gosvami on the bank of the Ganges, and another
at Naimisaranya between Sita Gosvami and the sages at Naimisaranya
Forest, headed by Saunaka Rsi. Furthermore, while instructing King
Pariksit, Sukadeva Gosvami often relates historical episodes and gives
accounts of lengthy philosophical discussions between such great souls as
the saint Maitreya and his disciple Vidura. With this understanding of
the history of the Bhagavatam, the reader will easily be able to follow its
intermingling of dialogues and events from various sources. Since philo-
sophical wisdom, not chronological order, is most important in the text,
one need only be attentive to the subject matter of Srimad-Bhagavatam
to appreciate fully its profound message.

The translator of this edition compares the Bhagavatam to sugar
candy — wherever you taste it, you will find it equally sweet and relisha-
ble. Therefore, to taste the sweetness of the Bhagavatam, one may begin
by reading any of its volumes. After such an introductory taste, however,
the serious reader is best advised to go back to Volume One of the First
Canto and then proceed through the Bhagavatam, volume after volume,
in its natural order.

This edition of the Bhagavatam is the first complete English transla-
tion of this important text with an elaborate commentary, and it is the
first widely available to the English-speaking public. It is the product of

Introduction xv
the scholarly and devotional effort of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhakti-
vedanta Swami Prabhupada, the world’s most distinguished teacher of
Indian religious and philosophical thought. His consummate Sanskrit
scholarship and intimate familiarity with Vedic culture and thought as
well as the modern way of life combine to reveal to the West a magnifi-
cent exposition of this important classic.

Readers will find this work of value for many reasons. For those in-
terested in the classical roots of Indian civilization, it serves as a vast
reservoir of detailed information on virtually every one of its aspects.
For students of comparative philosophy and religion, the Bhagavatam
offers a penetrating view into the meaning of India’s profound spiritual
heritage. To sociologists and anthropologists, the Bhagavatam reveals the
practical workings of a peaceful and scientifically organized Vedic
culture, whose institutions were integrated on the basis of a highly
developed spiritual world-view. Students of literature will discover the
Bhagavatam to be a masterpiece of majestic poetry. For students of psy-
chology, the text provides important perspectives on the nature of con-
sciousness, human behavior and the philosophical study of identity.
Finally, to those seeking spiritual insight, the Bhagavatam offers simple
and practical guidance for attainment of the highest self-knowledge and
realization of the Absolute Truth. The entire multivolume text, pre-
sented by the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, promises to occupy a significant
place in the intellectual, cultural and spiritual life of modern man for a
long time to come.

CHAPTER THIRTEEN
The Stealing of the
Boys and Calves by Brahma
This chapter describes Lord Brahma’s attempt to take away the calves
and cowherd boys, and it also describes the bewilderment of Lord
Brahma and finally the clearance of his illusion.

Although the incident concerning Aghasura had been performed one
year before, when the cowherd boys were five years old, when they were
six years old they said, “It happened today.” What happened was this.
After killing Aghasura, Krsna, along with His associates the cowherd
boys, went for a picnic within the forest. The calves, being allured by
green grasses, gradually went far away, and therefore Krsna’s associates
became a little agitated and wanted to bring back the calves. Krsna,
however, encouraged the boys by saying, “You take your tiffin without
being agitated. I shall go find the calves.” And thus the Lord departed.
Then, just to examine the potency of Krsna, Lord Brahma took away all
the calves and cowherd boys and kept them in a secluded place.

When Krsna was unable to find the calves and boys, He could under-
stand that this was a trick performed by Brahma. Then the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead, the cause of all causes, in order to please Lord
Brahma, as well as His own associates and their mothers, expanded Him-
self to become the calves and boys, exactly as they were before. In this
way, He discovered another pastime. A special feature of this pastime
was that the mothers of the cowherd boys thus became more attached to
their respective sons, and the cows became more attached to their calves.
After nearly a year, Baladeva observed that all the cowherd boys and
calves were expansions of Krsna. Thus He inquired from Krsna and was
informed of what had happened.

When one full year had passed, Brahma returned and saw that Krsna
was still engaged as usual with His friends and the calves and cows. Then
Krsna exhibited all the calves and cowherd boys as four-armed forms of
Narayana. Brahma could then understand Krsna’s potency, and he was

1

2 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 10, Ch. 13
astonished by the pastimes of Krsna, his worshipable Lord. Krsna,
however, bestowed His causeless mercy upon Brahma and released him
from illusion. Thus Brahma began to offer prayers to glorify the
Supreme Personality of Godhead.

greatly fortunate personality; tvaya—by you; bhagavata-uttama—O
best of devotees; yat—because; nitanayasi—you are making newer and

TRANSLATION

Srila Sukadeva Gosvami said: O best of devotees, most fortunate
Pariksit, you have inquired very nicely, for although constantly
hearing the pastimes of the Lord, you are perceiving His activities
to be newer and newer.

PURPORT

Unless one is very advanced in Krsna consciousness, one cannot stick
to hearing the pastimes of the Lord constantly. Nitya nava-navaya-
manam: even though advanced devotees hear continually about the Lord
for years, they still feel that these topics are coming to them as newer and

fresher. Therefore such devotees cannot give up hearing of the pastimes
of Lord Krsna. Premanjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santah sadaiva

have developed love for Krsna. Yar Syamasundaram acintya-guna-svari-
pari govindam adi-purusarn tam ahari bhajami (Brahma-samhita 5.38).
Pariksit Maharaja, therefore, is addressed as bhagavatottama, the best of
devotees, because unless one is very much elevated in devotional service,
one cannot feel ecstasy from hearing more and more and appreciate the
topics as ever fresher and newer.

TRANSLATION
Paramaharnsas, devotees who have accepted the essence of life,
are attached to Krsna in the core of their hearts, and He is the aim
of their lives. It is their nature to talk only of Krsna at every


--- Page 10 ---
4 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 10, Ch. 13
moment, as if such topics were newer and newer. They are at-
tached to such topics, just as materialists are attached to topics of
women and sex.
PURPORT
The word sara-bhrtam means paramaharisas. The harisa, or swan,

accepts milk from a mixture of milk and water and rejects the water.
Similarly, the nature of persons who have taken to spiritual life and
Krsna consciousness, understanding Krsna to be the life and soul of
everyone, is that they cannot give up krsna-katha, or topics about Krsna,
at any moment. Such paramahamsas always see Krsna within the core
of the heart (santah sadaiva hrdayesu vilokayanti). Kama (desires),
krodha (anger) and bhaya (fear) are always present in the material
world, but in the spiritual, or transcendental, world one can use them
for Krsna. Kamam krsna-karmarpane. The desire of the paramahari-
sas, therefore, is to act always for Krsna. Krodhari bhakta-dvesi jane.
They use anger against the nondevotees and transform bhaya, or fear,
into fear of being deviated from Krsna consciousness. In this way, the
life of a paramahamsa devotee is used entirely for Krsna, just as the life
of a person attached to the material world is used simply for women and
money. What is day for the materialistic person is night for the spiritu-
alist. What is very sweet for the materialist—namely women and
money —is regarded as poison by the spiritualist.

sandarsanam visayinam atha yositam ca

ha hanta hanta visa-bhaksanato ‘py asadhu
This is the instruction of Caitanya Mahaprabhu. For the paramahamsa,
Krsna is everything, but for the materialist, women and money are
everything.

are clean and soft. Therefore, this must be considered the best
place for our sporting and pastimes.

where our Krsna-Balarama temple is situated. Everyone who visits this

TRANSLATION

Like the whorl of a lotus flower surrounded by its petals and
leaves, Krsna sat in the center, encircled by lines of His friends,
who all looked very beautiful. Every one of them was trying to
look forward toward Krsna, thinking that Krsna might look
toward him. In this way they all enjoyed their lunch in the forest.

PURPORT

To a pure devotee, Krsna is always visible, as stated in the Brahma-
sarnhita (santah sadaiva hrdayesu vilokayanti) and as indicated by
Krsna Himself in Bhagavad-gita (sarvatah pani-padam tat sarvato ’ksi-
siro-mukham). If by accumulating pious activities (krta-punya-pufijah)
one is raised to the platform of pure devotional service, Krsna is always
visible in the core of one’s heart. One who has attained such perfection is
all-beautiful in transcendental bliss. The present Krsna consciousness
movement is an attempt to keep Krsna in the center, for if this is done all
activities will automatically become beautiful and blissful.

TRANSLATION
Krsna is yajiia-bhuk —that is, He eats only offerings of yajia—

but to exhibit His childhood pastimes, He now sat with His flute
tucked between His waist and His tight cloth on His right side and
with His horn bugle and cow-driving stick on His left. Holding in
His hand a very nice preparation of yogurt and rice, with pieces of
suitable fruit between His fingers, He sat like the whorl of a lotus
flower, looking forward toward all His friends, personally joking
with them and creating jubilant laughter among them as He ate. At

that time, the denizens of heaven were watching, struck with
wonder at how the Personality of Godhead, who eats only in yajiia,
was now eating with His friends in the forest.
PURPORT
When Krsna was eating with His cowherd boyfriends, a certain
bumblebee came there to take part in the eating. Thus Krsna joked,
“Why have you come to disturb My brahmana friend Madhumangala?
You want to kill a brahmana. This is not good.” All the boys would laugh
and enjoy, speaking such joking words while eating. Thus the inhabi-
tants of the higher planets were astonished at how the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead, who eats only when yajfia is offered, was now eating
like an ordinary child with His friends in the forest.

tan—that those calves were going away; drstva—seeing; bhaya-
santrastan—to the cowherd boys, who were disturbed by fear that within
the dense forest the calves would be attacked by some ferocious animals;
ice —Krsna said; krsnah asya bhi-bhayam—XKrsna, who is Himself the
fearful element of all kinds of fear (when Krsna is present, there is no
fear); mitrani—My dear friends; asat—from your enjoyment of eating;

TRANSLATION

When Krsna saw that His friends the cowherd boys were
frightened, He, the fierce controller even of fear itself, said, just to
mitigate their fear, “My dear friends, do not stop eating. I shall
bring your calves back to this spot by personally going after them
Myself.”

PURPORT

In the presence of Krsna’s friendship, a devotee cannot have any fear.
Krsna is the supreme controller, the controller of even death, which is
supposed to be the ultimate fear in this material world. Bhayam
dvittyabhinivesatah syat (Bhag. 11.2.37). This fear arises because of
lack of Krsna consciousness; otherwise there cannot be any fear. For one
who has taken shelter of the lotus feet of Krsna, this material world of
fear becomes hardly dangerous at all.

--- Page 20 ---
14 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 10, Ch. 13
Bhavambudhih, the material ocean of fear, becomes very easy to cross by
the mercy of the supreme controller. This material world, in which there
is fear and danger at every step (padam pada yad vipadam), is not
meant for those who have taken shelter at Krsna’s lotus feet. Such per-
sons are delivered from this fearful world.
samasrita ye pada-pallava-plavar
mahat-padari punya-yaso murareh
bhavambudhir vatsa-padar param padari
pada pada yad vipaddm na tesam

- (Bhag. 10.14.58)
Everyone, therefore, should take shelter of the Supreme Person, who is
the source of fearlessness, and thus be secure.

TRANSLATION

“Let Me go and search for the calves,” Krsna said. “Don’t dis-
turb your enjoyment.” Then, carrying His yogurt and rice in His
hand, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, immediately
went out to search for the calves of His friends. To please His


--- Page 21 ---
Text 15] Brahma Stealing the Boys and Calves 15
friends, He began searching in all the mountains, mountain caves,
bushes and narrow passages.
PURPGRT
The Vedas (Svetasvatara Up. 6.8) assert that the Supreme Personality
of Godhead has nothing to do personally (na tasya karyam karanam ca
vidyate) because He is doing everything through His energies and poten-
cies (parasya Saktir vividhaiva srizyate). Nonetheless, here we see that
He took personal care to find the calves of His friends. This was Krsna’s
causeless mercy. Mayadhyaksena prakrtih sityate sa-caracaram: all the
affairs of the entire world and the entire cosmic manifestation are work-
ing under His direction, through His different energies. Still, when there
is a need to take care of His friends, He does this personally. Krsna
assured His friends, “Don’t be afraid. I am going personally to search for
your calves.” This was Krsna’s causeless mercy.

TRANSLATION

O Maharaja Pariksit, Brahma, who resides in the higher plan-
etary system in the sky, had observed the activities of the most
powerful Krsna in killing and delivering Aghasura, and he was
astonished. Now that same Brahma wanted to show some of his
own power and see the power of Krsna, who was engaged in His
childhood pastimes, playing as if with ordinary cowherd boys.
Therefore, in Krsna’s absence, Brahma took all the boys and calves
to another place. Thus he became entangled, for in the very near
future he would see how powerful Krsna was.

PURPORT

When Aghasura was being killed by Krsna, who was accompanied by
His associates, Brahma was astonished, but when he saw that Krsna was
very much enjoying His pastimes of lunch, he was even more astonished
and wanted to test whether Krsna was actually there. Thus he became
entangled in Krsna’s maya. After all, Brahma was born materially. As
mentioned here, ambhojanma-janih: he was born of ambhoja, a lotus
flower. It does not matter that he was born of a lotus and not of any man,
animal or material father. A lotus is also material, and anyone born
through the material energy must be subject to the four material
deficiencies: bhrama (the tendency to commit mistakes), pramada (the
tendency to be illusioned), vipralipsa (the tendency to cheat) and kara-
ndpatava (imperfect senses). Thus Brahma also became entangled.

Brahma, with his maya, wanted to test whether Krsna was actually
present. These cowherd boys were but expansions of Krsna’s personal
self (ananda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhavitabhih). Later Krsna would show
Brahma how He expands Himself into everything as His personal


--- Page 23 ---
Text 16] Brahma Stealing the Boys and Calves 17
pleasure, ananda-cinmaya-rasa. Hladini saktir asmat: Krsna has a tran-
scendental potency called hladini Sakti. He does not enjoy anything that
is a product of the material energy. Brahma, therefore, would see Lord
Krsna expand His energy.

Brahma wanted to take away Krsna’s associates, but instead he took
away some other boys and calves. Ravana wanted to take away Sita, but
that was impossible, and instead he took away a maya Sita. Similarly,
Brahma took away mayarbhakah: boys manifested by Krsna’s maya.
Brahma could show some extraordinary opulence to the mayarbhakah;
but he could not show any extraordinary potency to Krsna’s associates.
That he would see in the very near future. Mayarbhakasya iSituh. This
bewilderment, this maya, was caused by the supreme controller,
prabhavatah—the all-potent Supreme Person, Krsna—and we shall see
the result. Anyone materially born is subject to bewilderment. This
pastime is therefore called brahma-vimohana-lila, the pastime of
bewildering Brahma. Mohitarh nabhijanati mam ebhyah param avya-
yam (Bg. 7.13). Materially born persons cannot fully understand Krsna.
Even the demigods cannot understand Him (muhyanti yat sirayah).
Tene brahma hrda ya adi-kavaye (Bhag. 1.1.1). Everyone, from Brahma
down to the small insect, must take lessons from Krsna.

Thereafter, when Krsna was unable to find the calves, He
returned to the bank of the river, but there He was also unable to
see the cowherd boys. Thus He began to search for both the calves
and the boys, as if He could not understand what had happened.
PURPORT
Krsna could immediately understand that Brahma had taken away
both the calves and the boys, but as an innocent child He searched here
and there so that Brahma could not understand Krsna’s maya. This was
all a dramatic performance. A player knows everything, but still he plays
on the stage in such a way that others do not understand him.

Although Krsna is visva-vit, the knower of everything happening in
the entire cosmic manifestation, as an innocent child He showed ig-
norance of Brahma’s actions, although He could immediately understand
that these were the doings of Brahma. This pastime is called brahma-
vimohana, the bewilderment of Brahma. Brahma was already bewildered
by Krsna’s activities as an innocent child, and now he would be further
bewildered.

Thereafter, just to create pleasure both for Brahma and for the

Although Brahma was already entangled in bewilderment, he wanted
to show his power to the cowherd boys; but after he took away the boys
and their calves and returned to his abode, Krsna created further

astonishment for Brahma, and for the mothers of the boys, by establish-
ing the lunch pastimes in the forest again and replacing all the calves and
boys, just as they had appeared before. According to the Vedas, ekam
bahu syam: the Personality of Godhead can become many, many millions
upon millions of calves and cowherd boys, as He did to bewilder Brahma
more and more.

By His Vasudeva feature, Krsna simultaneously expanded Him-

with their exact bodily features, their particular types of hands,
legs and other limbs, their sticks, bugles and flutes, their lunch
bags, their particular types of dress and ornaments placed in
various ways, their names, ages and forms, and their special ac-
tivities and characteristics. By expanding Himself in this way,
beautiful Krsna proved the statement samagra-jagad visnumayam:
“Lord Visnu is all-pervading.”
PURPORT
As stated in the Brahma-samhita (5.33):
advaitam acyutam anadim ananta-ripam
adyam purana-purusari nava-yauvanar ca

Krsna, param brahma, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is adyam,
the beginning of everything; He is adi-purusam, the ever-youthful
original person. He can expand Himself in more forms than one can
imagine, yet He does not fall down from His original form as Krsna;
therefore He is called Acyuta. This is the Supreme Personality of God-
head. Sarva visnumayam jagat. Sarvari khalv 1007 brahma. Krsna
thus proved that He is everything, that He can become everything, but
that still He is personally different from everything (mat-sthani sarva-
bhitani na cahari tesv avasthitah). This is Krsna, who is understood by
acintya-bhedabheda-tattva philosophy. Pirnasya parnam ৫৫৫১৫ pur-
nam evavasisyate: Krsna is always complete, and although He can create
millions of universes, all of them full in all opulences, He remains as
opulent as ever, without any change (advaitam). This is explained by
different Vaisnava acaryas through philosophies such as visuddhadvaita,
visistadvaita and dvaitadvaita. Therefore one must learn about Krsna
from the dacdryas. Acaryavan puruso veda: one who follows the path of
the acaryas knows things as they are. Such a person can know Krsna as
He is, at least to some extent, and as soon as one understands Krsna
(janma karma ca me divyam evam yo vetti tattvatah), one is liberated
from material bondage (tyaktva dehar punar janma naiti mam eti so
rjuna).

TRANSLATION

Now expanding Himself so as to appear as all the calves and
cowherd boys, all of them as they were, and at the same time ap-
pear as their leader, Krsna entered Vrajabhimi, the land of His
father, Nanda Maharaja, just as He usually did while enjoying their
company.

PURPORT

Krsna usually stayed in the forest and pasturing ground, taking care
of the calves and cows with His associates the cowherd boys. Now that the
original group had been taken away by Brahma, Krsna Himself assumed
the forms of every member of the group, without anyone’s knowledge,
even the knowledge of Baladeva, and continued the usual program. He
was ordering His friends to do this and that, and He was controlling the
calves and going into the forest to search for them when they went
astray, allured by new grass, but these calves and boys were He Himself.
This was Krsna’s inconceivable potency. As explained by Srila Jiva
Gosvami, radha krsna-pranaya-vikrtir hladini saktir asmat. Radha and

Krsna are the same. Krsna, by expanding His pleasure potency, becomes
Radharani. The same pleasure potency (ananda-cinmaya-rasa) was ex-
panded by Krsna when He Himself became all the calves and boys and
enjoyed transcendental bliss in Vrajabhtami. This was done by the
yogamaya potency and was inconceivable to persons under the potency
of mahamaya.

TRANSLATION

The mothers of the boys, upon hearing the sounds of the flutes
and bugles being played by their sons, immediately rose from
their household tasks, lifted their boys onto their laps, embraced
them with both arms and began to feed them with their breast
milk, which flowed forth because of extreme love specifically for
Krsna. Actually Krsna is everything, but at that time, expressing
extreme love and affection, they took special pleasure in feeding
Krsna, the Parabrahman, and Krsna drank the milk from His re-
spective mothers as if it were a nectarean beverage.

PURPORT

Although all the elderly gopis knew that Krsna was the son of mother
३5०८३, they still desired, “If Krsna had become my son, I would also
have taken care of Him like mother Yasoda.”” This was their inner ambi-
tion. Now, in order to please them, Krsna personally took the role of
their sons and fulfilled their desire. They enhanced their special love for

Krsna by embracing Him and feeding Him, and Krsna tasted their breast
milk to be just like a nectarean beverage. While thus bewildering
Brahma, He enjoyed the special transcendental pleasure created by
yogamaya between all the other mothers and Himself.

Thereafter, all the cows entered their different sheds and began
mooing loudly, calling for their respective calves. When the calves
arrived, the mothers began licking the calves’ bodies again and
again and profusely feeding them with the milk flowing from their
milk bags.
PURPORT
All the dealings between the calves and their respective mothers tak-
ing care of them were enacted by Krsna Himself.

TRANSLATION
Previously, from the very beginning, the gopis had motherly
affection for Krsna. Indeed, their affection for Krsna exceeded
even their affection for their own sons. In displaying their affec-
tion, they had thus distinguished between Krsna and their sons,
but now that distinction disappeared.
PURPORT
The distinction between one’s own son and another’s son is not un-
natural. Many elderly women have motherly affection for the sons of
others. They observe distinctions, however, between those other sons and
their own. But now the elderly gopis could not distinguish between their
own sons and Krsna, for since their own sons had been taken by Brahma,
Krsna had expanded as their sons. Therefore, their extra affection for
their sons, who were now Krsna Himself, was due to bewilderment
resembling that of Brahma. Previously, the mothers of Sridama,
Sudiama, Subala and Krsna’s other friends did not have the same affec-
tion for one another’s sons, but now the gopis treated all the boys as their
own. Sukadeva Gosvami, therefore, wanted to explain this increment of
affection in terms of Krsna’s bewilderment of Brahma, the gopis, the
cows and everyone else.

own sons continuously increased, for Krsna had now become their
sons. There was no limit to the increment of their affection for
their sons, who were now Krsna. Every day they found new in-
spiration for loving their children as much as they loved Krsna.

TRANSLATION
In this way, Lord Sri Krsna, having Himself become the cowherd
boys and groups of calves, maintained Himself by Himself. Thus
He continued His pastimes, both in Vrndavana and in the forest,
for one year.
PURPORT
Everything was Krsna. The calves, the cowherd boys and their main-
tainer Himself were all Krsna. In other words, Krsna expanded Himself
in varieties of calves and cowherd boys and continued His pastimes un-
interrupted for one year. As stated in Bhagavad-gita, Krsna’s expansion
is situated in everyone’s heart as the Supersoul. Similarly, instead of ex-
panding Himself as the Supersoul, He expanded Himself as a portion of
calves and cowherd boys for one continuous year.

One day, five or six nights before the completion of the year,

Up to this time, even Balarama was captivated by the bewilderment
that covered Brahma. Even Balarama did not know that all the calves and

expansion of Krsna. This was disclosed to Balarama just five or six days
before the completion of the year.

toward their calves with great anxiety, each running as if with one
pair of legs. Their milk bags full and flowing with milk, their
heads and tails raised, and their humps moving with their necks,
they ran forcefully until they reached their calves to feed them.
PURPORT
Generally the calves and cows are pastured separately. The elderly
men take care of the cows, and the small children see to the calves. This
time, however, the cows immediately forgot their position as soon as they
saw the calves below Govardhana Hill, and they ran with great force,
their tails erect and their front and hind legs joined, until they reached
their calves.

34 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 10, Ch. 13
PURPORT
After Brahma stole the original cowherd boys and calves, Krsna ex-
panded Himself to become the boys and calves again. Therefore, because
the boys were actually Krsna’s expansions, the cowherd men were es-
pecially attracted to them. At first the cowherd men, who were on top of
the hill, were angry, but because of Krsna the boys were extremely at-
tractive, and therefore the cowherd men immediately came down from
the hill with special affection.

Thereafter the elderly cowherd men, having obtained great feel-
ing from embracing their sons, gradually and with great difficulty
and reluctance ceased embracing them and returned to the forest.
But as the men remembered their sons, tears began to roll down
from their eyes.
PURPORT
In the beginning the cowherd men were angry that the cows were
being attracted by the calves, but when the men came down from the
hill, they themselves were attracted by their sons, and therefore the men
embraced them. To embrace one’s son and smell his head are symptoms
of affection.

TRANSLATION

Because of an increase of affection, the cows had constant attach-
ment even to those calves that were grown up and had stopped
sucking milk from their mothers. When Baladeva saw this attach-
ment, He was unable to understand the reason for it, and thus He
began to consider as follows.

PURPORT |

The cows had younger calves who had started sucking milk from their
mothers, and some of the cows had newly given birth, but now, because
of love, the cows enthusiastically showed their affection for the older
calves, which had left off milking. These calves were grown up, but still
the mothers wanted to feed them. Therefore Balarama was a little
surprised, and He wanted to inquire from Krsna about the reason for
their behavior. The mothers were actually more anxious to feed the older
calves, although the new calves were present, because the older calves
were expansions of Krsna. These surprising events were taking place by
the manipulation of yogamaya. There are two mayas working under the
direction of Krsna—mahamaya, the energy of the material world, and
yogamadya, the energy of the spiritual world. These uncommon events
were taking place because of the influence of yogamaya. From the very


--- Page 42 ---
36 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 10, Ch. 13
day on which Brahma stole the calves and boys, yogamaya acted in such
a way that the residents of Vrndavana, including even Lord Balarama,
could not understand how yogamaya was working and causing such un-
common things to happen. But as yogamdaya gradually acted, Balarama
in particular was able to understand what was happening, and therefore
He inquired from Krsna.

TRANSLATION
What is this wonderful phenomenon? The affection of all the
inhabitants of Vraja, including Me, toward these boys and calves is
increasing as never before, just like our affection for Lord Krsna,
the Supersoul of all living entities.
PURPORT
This increase of affection was not maya; rather, because Krsna had
expanded Himself as everything and because the whole life of everyone
in Vrndavana was meant for Krsna, the cows, because of affection for
Krsna, had more affection for the older calves than for the new calves,
and the men increased in their affection for their sons. Balarama was
astonished to see all the residents of Vrndavana so affectionate toward
their own children, exactly as they had been for Krsna. Similarly, the


--- Page 43 ---
Text 37] Brahma Stealing the Boys and Calves 37
cows had grown affectionate toward their calves—as much as toward
Krsna. Balarama was surprised to see the acts of yogamaya. Therefore He
inquired from Krsna, “What is happening here? What is this mystery?”

TRANSLATION
Who is this mystic power, and where has she come from? Is she
a demigod or a demoness? She must be the illusory energy of My
master, Lord Krsna, for who else can bewilder Me?
PURPORT
Balarama was surprised. This extraordinary show of affection, He’
thought, was something mystical, performed either by the demigods or
some wonderful man. Otherwise, how could this wonderful change take
place? “This maya might be some raksasi-maya,”” He thought, “but how
can raksasi-maya have any influence upon Me? This is not possible.
Therefore it must be the maya of Krsna.” He thus concluded that the
mystical change must have been caused by Krsna, whom Balarama con-
sidered His worshipable Personality of Godhead. He thought, “It was ar-
ranged by Krsna, and even I could not check its mystic power.” Thus
Balarama understood that all these boys and calves were only expansions
of Krsna.

Every individual is different. There are even differences between twin
brothers. Yet when Krsna expanded Himself as the boys and calves, each
boy and each calf appeared in its own original feature, with the same in-
dividual way of acting, the same tendencies, the same color, the same
dress, and so on, for Krsna manifested Himself with all these differences.
This was Krsna’s opulence.

TRANSLATION

Lord Baladeva said, “0 supreme controller! These boys are not
great demigods, as I previously thought. Nor are these calves great
sages like Narada. Now I can see that You alone are manifesting
Yourself in all varieties of difference. Although one, You are exist-
ing in the different forms of the calves and boys. Please briefly ex-
plain this to Me.” Having thus been requested by Lord Baladeva,
Krsna explained the whole situation, and Baladeva understood it.

PURPORT .

Inquiring from Krsna about the actual situation, Lord Balarama said,
“My dear Krsna, in the beginning I thought that all these cows, calves
and cowherd boys were either great sages and saintly persons or demi-
gods, but at the present it appears that they are actually Your expansions.
They are all You; You Yourself are playing as the calves and cows and
boys. What is the mystery of this situation? Where have those other
calves and cows and boys gone? And why are You expanding Yourself as
the cows, calves and boys? Will You kindly tell Me what is the cause?”
At the request of Balarama, Krsna briefly explained the whole situation:
how the calves and boys were stolen by Brahma and how He was conceal-
ing the incident by expanding Himself so that people would not know
that the original cows, calves and boys were missing. Balarama under-
stood, therefore, that this was not maya but Krsna’s opulence. Krsna has
all opulences, and this was but another opulence of Krsna.

“At first,” Lord Balarama said, “I thought that these boys and calves


--- Page 46 ---
40 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 10, Ch. 13
were a display of the power of great sages like Narada, but now I see that
all these boys and calves are You.” After inquiring from Krsna, Lord
Balarama understood that Krsna Himself had become many. That the
Lord can do this is stated in the Brahma-samhita (5.33). Advaitam
acyutam andadim ananta-ripam: although He is one, He can expand
Himself in so many forms. According to the Vedic version, ekari bahu
syam: He can expand Himself into many thousands and millions but
still remain one. In that sense, everything is spiritual because everything
is an expansion of Krsna; that is, everything is an expansion either of
Krsna Himself or of His potency. Because the potency is nondifferent
from the potent, the potency and the potent are one (sakti-saktimator
abhedah). The Mayavadis, however, say, cid-acit-samanvayah: spirit
and matter are one. This is a wrong conception. Spirit (cit) is different
from matter (acit), as explained by Krsna Himself in Bhagavad-gita
(7.4-5) :
bhamir apo 71410 vayuh
4110778 mano buddhir eva ca
aharkdara ittyam me
bhinna prakrtir astadha
apareyam itas tv anyari
prakrtirh viddhi me param
Jjiva-bhuatarn maha-baho
yayedari dharyate jagat
“Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego—all
together these eight comprise My separated material energies. But
besides this inferior nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is a superior
energy of Mine, which consists of all living entities who are struggling
with material nature and are sustaining the universe.” Spirit and matter
cannot be made one, for actually they are superior and inferior energies,
yet the Mayavadis, or Advaita-vadis, try to make them one. This is
wrong. Although spirit and matter ultimately come from the same one
source, they cannot be made one. For example, there are many things
that come from our bodies, but although they come from the same
source, they cannot be made one. We should be careful to note that al-


--- Page 47 ---
Text 40] Brahma Stealing the Boys and Calves 41
though the supreme source is one, the emanations from this source
should be separately regarded as inferior and superior. The difference
between the Mayavada and Vaisnava philosophies is that the Vaisnava
philosophy recognizes this fact. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s philosophy,
therefore, is called acintya-bhedabheda—simultaneous oneness and dif-
ference. For example, fire and heat cannot be separated, for where there
is fire there is heat and where there is heat there is fire. Nonetheless, al-
though we cannot touch fire, heat we can tolerate. Therefore, although
they are one, they are different.

‘When Lord Brahma returned after a moment of time had passed
(according to his own measurement), he saw that although by
human measurement a complete year had passed, Lord Krsna,
after all that time, was engaged just as before in playing with the
boys and calves, who were His expansions.

PURPORT

Lord Brahma had gone away for only a moment of his time, but when

he returned, a year of human time had passed. On different planets, the

calculation of time is different. To give an example, a man-made satellite
may orbit the earth in an hour and twenty-five minutes and thus com-
plete one full day, although a day ordinarily takes twenty-four hours for
those living on earth. Therefore, what was but a moment for Brahma was
one year on earth. Krsna continued to expand Himself in so many forms
for one year, but by the arrangement of yogamaya no one could under-
stand this but Balarama.

After one moment of Brahma’s calculation, Brahma came back to see
the fun caused by his stealing the boys and calves. But he was also afraid
that he was playing with fire. Krsna was his master, and he had played
mischief for fun by taking away Krsna’s calves and boys. He was really
anxious, so he did not stay away very long; he came back after a moment
(of his calculation). When Brahmi returned, he saw that all the boys,
calves and cows were playing with Krsna in the same way as when he had
come upon them; by Krsna’s display of yogamayda, the same pastimes
were going on without any change.

On the day when Lord Brahma had first come, Baladeva could not go
with Krsna and the cowherd boys, for it was His birthday, and His
mother had kept Him back for the proper ceremonial bath, called san-
tika-snana. Therefore Lord Baladeva was not taken by Brahma at that
time. Now, one year later, Brahma returned, and because he returned on
exactly the same day, Baladeva was again kept at home for His birthday.
Therefore, although this verse mentions that Brahma saw Krsna and all
the cowherd boys, Baladeva is not mentioned. It was five or six days
earlier that Baladeva had inquired from Krsna about the extraordinary
affection of the cows and cowherd men, but now, when Brahma
returned, Brahma saw all the calves and cowherd boys playing with
Krsna as expansions of Krsna, but he did not see Baladeva. As in the pre-
vious year, Lord Baladeva did not go to the woods on the day Lord
Brahma appeared there.

TRANSLATION

Lord Brahma thought: Whatever boys and calves there were in
Gokula, I have kept them sleeping on the bed of my mystic po-
tency, and to this very day they have not yet risen again.

PURPORT

For one year Lord Brahma kept the calves and boys lying down in a
cave by his mystic power. Therefore when Brahma saw Lord Krsna still
playing with all the cows and calves, he began trying to reason about
what was happening. “What is this?”’ he thought. “Maybe I took those
calves and cowherd boys away but now they have been taken from that
cave. Is this what has happened? Has Krsna brought them back here?”
Then, however, Lord Brahma saw that the calves and boys he had taken
were still in the same mystic maya into which he had put them. Thus he
concluded that the calves and cowherd boys now playing with Krsna were
different from the ones in the cave. He could understand that although
the original calves and boys were still in the cave where he had put them,
Krsna had expanded Himself and so the present demonstration of calves
and boys consisted of expansions of Krsna. They had the same features,
the same mentality and the same intentions, but they were all Krsna.

TRANSLATION
A similar number of boys and calves have been playing with
Krsna for one whole year, yet they are different from the ones illu-

from?
PURPORT
Although appearing like calves, cows and cowherd boys, these were all
Visnu. Actually they were visnu-tattva, not jiva-tattva. Brahma was
surprised. “The original cowherd boys and cows,” he thought, “are still
where I put them last year. So who is it that is now keeping company
with Krsna exactly as before? Where have they come from?” Brahma
was surprised that his mystic power had been neglected. Without touch-
ing the original cows and cowherd boys kept by Brahma, Krsna had cre-
ated another assembly of calves and boys, who were all expansions of
visnu-tattva. Thus Brahma’s mystic power was superseded.

TRANSLATION

Thus Lord Brahma, thinking and thinking for a long time, tried
to distinguish between those two sets of boys, who were each sepa-
rately existing. He tried to understand who was real and who was
not real, but he couldn’t understand at all.

PURPORT

Brahma was puzzled. “The original boys and calves are still sleeping
as I have kept them,” he thought, “but another set is here playing with
Krsna. How has this happened ?”” Brahma could not grasp what was hap-
pening. Which boys were real, and which were not real? Brahma was un-
able to come to any definite conclusion. He pondered the matter for a
long while. “How can there be two sets of calves and boys at the same
time? Have the boys and calves here been created by Krsna, or has Krsna
created the ones lying asleep? Or are both merely creations of Krsna?”
Brahma thought about the subject in many different ways. “After I go to
the cave and see that the boys and calves are still there, does Krsna go
take them away and put them here so that I come here and see them, and
does Krsna then take them from here and put them there?” Brahma
could not figure out how there could be two sets of calves and cowherd
boys exactly alike. Although thinking and thinking, he could not under-
stand at all.

TRANSLATION

Thus because Lord Brahma wanted to mystify the all-pervading
Lord Krsna, who can never be mystified, but who, on the contrary,
mystifies the entire universe, he himself was put into bewilder-
ment by his own mystic power.

PURPORT

Brahmi wanted to bewilder Krsna, who bewilders the entire universe.
The whole universe is under Krsna’s mystic power (mama maya
duratyaya), but Brahma wanted to mystify Him. The result was that
Brahma himself was mystified, just as one who wants to kill another may
himself be killed. In other words, Brahma was defeated by his own at-
tempt. In a similar position are the scientists and philosophers who want
to overcome the mystic power of Krsna. They challenge Krsna, saying,
“What is God? We can do this, and we can do that.” But the more they
challenge Krsna in this way, the more they are implicated in suffering.
The lesson here is that we should not try to overcome Krsna. Rather, in-
stead of endeavoring to surpass Him, we should surrender to Him
(sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam Saranam vraja).

Instead of defeating Krsna, Brahma himself was defeated, for he could
not understand what Krsna was doing. Since Brahma, the chief person
within this universe, was so bewildered, what is to be said of so-called
scientists and philosophers? Sarva-dharman parityajya mam 61077
Saranarm vraja. We should give up all our tiny efforts to defy the ar-
rangement of Krsna. Instead, whatever arrangements He proposes, we
should accept. This is always better, for this will make us happy. The


--- Page 53 ---
Text 44] Brahma Stealing the Boys and Calves 47
more we try to defeat the arrangement of Krsna, the more we become
implicated in Krsna’s maya (daivi hy esd gunamayi mama maya
duratyaya). But one who has reached the point of surrendering to the in-

॥ structions of Krsna (mam eva ye prapadyante) is liberated, free from
krsna-maya (mayam etam taranti te). The power of Krsna is just like a
government that cannot be overcome. First of all there are laws, and then
there is police power, and beyond that is military power. Therefore, what
is the use of trying to overcome the power of the government? Similarly,
what is the use of trying to challenge Krsna?

From the next verse it is clear that Krsna cannot be defeated by any
kind of mystic power. If one gets even a little power of scientific knowl-
edge, one tries to defy God, but actually no one is able to bewilder Krsna.
When Brahma, the chief person within the universe, tried to bewilder
Krsna, he himself was bewildered and astonished. This is the position of
the conditioned soul. Brahma wanted to mystify Krsna, but he himself
was mystified.

The word visnum is significant in this verse. Visnu pervades the entire
material world, whereas Brahma merely occupies one subordinate post.
yasyaika-nisvasita-kalam athavalambya

Jjivanti loma-vila-ja jagadanda-nathah
(Brahma-sarhita 5.48)

The word nathah, which refers to Lord Brahma, is plural because there
are innumerable universes and innumerable Brahmas. Brahma is but a
tiny force. This was exhibited in Dvaraka when Krsna called for Brahma.
One day when Brahma came to see Krsna at Dvaraka, the doorman, at
Lord Krsna’s request, asked, “Which Brahma are you?”’ Later, when
Brahma inquired from Krsna whether this meant that there was more
than one Brahma, Krsna smiled and at once called for many Brahmas
from many universes. The four-headed Brahma of this universe then
saw innumerable other Brahmas coming to see Krsna and offer their
respects. Some of them had ten heads, some had twenty, some had a
hundred and some had a million heads. Upon seeing this wonderful ex-
hibition, the four-headed Brahma became nervous and began to think of
himself as no more than a mosquito in the midst of many elephants.
Therefore, what can Brahma do to bewilder Krsna?

As the darkness of snow on a dark night and the light of a glow-

ferior person who tries to use it against a person of great power is
unable to accomplish anything; instead, the power of that inferior
person is diminished.
PURPORT
When one wants to supersede a superior power, one’s own inferior
power becomes ludicrous. Just as a glowworm in the daytime and snow at
night have no value, Brahma’s mystic power became worthless in the
presence of Krsna, for greater mystic power condemns inferior mystic
power. On a dark night, the darkness produced by snow has no meaning.
The glowworm appears very important at night, but in the daytime its
glow has no value; whatever little value it has is lost. Similarly, Brahma
became insignificant in the presence of Krsna’s mystic power. Krsna’s
maya was not diminished in value, but Brahma’s maya was condemned.
Therefore, one should not try to exhibit one’s insignificant opulence
before a greater power:

wearing yellow garments. Brahma was contemplating his own power and
the immense, unlimited power of Krsna, but before he could come to a
conclusion, he saw this immediate transformation.

sarapya-mukti in Vaikuntha and who consequently have forms exactly
like the form of the Lord. However, these Visnu forms appearing before
Lord Brahma also possessed the mark of Srivatsa and the Kaustubha
gem, which are special characteristics possessed only by the Supreme
Lord Himself. This proves that all these boys and calves were in fact
directly expansions of Visnu, the Personality of Godhead, not merely His
associates of Vaikuntha. Visnu Himself is included within Krsna. All the
opulences of Visnu are already present in Krsna, and consequently for
Krsna to demonstrate so many Visnu forms was actually not very
astonishing.

The Srivatsa mark is described by the Vaisnava-tosani as being a curl
of fine yellow hair on the upper portion of the right side of Lord Visnu’s
chest. This mark is not for ordinary devotees. It is a special mark of
Visnu or Krsna.

--- Page 58 ---
52 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 10, Ch. 13
PURPORT

The word bhiri-punyavad-arpitaih is significant in this verse. These
forms of Visnu were worshiped by those who had performed pious ac-
tivities (sukrtibhih) for many births and who were constantly engaged in
devotional service (sravanam kirtanar visnoh). Bhakti, devotional ser-
vice, is the engagement of those who have performed highly developed
pious activities. The accumulation of pious activities has already been
mentioned elsewhere in the Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.12.11), where
Sukadeva Gosvami says,

ittharn satam brahma-sukhanubhitya
dasyarh gatanam para-daivatena
mayasritanam nara-darakena
sakam vijahruh krta-punya-pufijah
“Those who are engaged in self-realization, appreciating the Brahman
effulgence of the Lord, and those engaged in devotional service, accept-
ing the Supreme Personality of Godhead as master, as well as those who
are under the clutches of maya, thinking the Lord an ordinary person,
cannot understand that certain exalted personalities—after accumulating
volumes of pious activities—are now playing with the Lord in friendship
as cowherd boys.”

In our Krsna-Balarama Temple in Vrndavana, there is a tamadla tree
that covers an entire corner of the courtyard. Before there was a temple
the tree was lying neglected, but now it has developed very luxuriantly,
covering the whole corner of the courtyard. This is a sign of bhari-
punya.

TRANSLATION

Those Visnu forms, by Their pure smiling, which resembled the
increasing light of the moon, and by the sidelong glances of Their
reddish eyes, created and protected the desires of Their own devo-
tees, as if by the modes of passion and goodness.

PURPORT

Those Visnu forms blessed the devotees with Their clear glances and
smiles, which resembled the increasingly full light of the moon (sreyah-
kairava-candrika-vitaranam). As maintainers, They glanced upon Their
devotees, embracing them and protecting them by smiling. Their smiles
resembled the mode of goodness, protecting all the desires of the devo-
tees, and the glancing of Their eyes resembled the mode of passion. Ac-
tually, in this verse the word rajah means not “passion” but “‘affection.”
In the material world, rajo-guna is passion, but in the spiritual world it is
affection. In the material world, affection is contaminated by rajo-guna
and tamo-guna, but in the suddha-sattva the affection that maintains the
devotees is transcendental.

The word svakarthanam refers to great desires. As mentioned in this
verse, the glance of Lord Visnu creates the desires of the devotees. A
pure devotee, however, has no desires. Therefore Sanatana Gosvami
comments that because the desires of devotees whose attention is fixed on
Krsna have already been fulfilled, the Lord’s sidelong glances create
variegated desires in relation to Krsna and devotional service. In the ma-
terial world, desire is a product of rajo-guna and tamo-guna, but desire
in the spiritual world gives rise to a variety of everlasting transcendental
service. Thus the word svakarthanam refers to eagerness to serve Krsna.

In Vrndavana there is a place where there was no temple, but a devo-
tee desired, ‘Let there be a temple and seva, devotional service.”
Therefore, what was once an empty corner has now become a place of
pilgrimage. Such are the desires of a devotee.

All beings, both moving and nonmoving, from the four-headed
Lord Brahma down to the most insignificant living entity, had

PURPORT
Innumerable living entities are engaged in different types of worship
of the Supreme, according to their abilities and karma, but everyone is
engaged (jivera ‘svarupa’ haya—krsnera ‘nitya-dasa’); there is no one
who is not serving. Therefore the maha-bhagavata, the topmost devotee,
sees everyone as being engaged in the service of Krsna; only himself
does he see as not engaged. We have to elevate ourselves from a lower
position to a higher position, and the topmost position is that of direct
service in Vrndavana. But everyone is engaged in service. Denial of the
service of the Lord is maya.

Text 52] Brahma Stealing the Boys and Calves 55
“Only Krsna is the supreme master, and all others are His servants. As
Krsna desires, everyone dances according to His tune.” (Cc. Adi 5.142)
There are two kinds of living entities—the moving and the nonmov-
ing. Trees, for example, stand in one place, whereas ants move. Brahma
saw that all of them, down to the smallest creatures, had assumed dif-
ferent forms and were accordingly engaged in the service of Lord Visnu.
One receives a form according to the way one worships the Lord. In
the material world, the body one receives is guided by the demigods. This
is sometimes referred to as the influence of the stars. As indicated in
Bhagavad-gita (3.27) by the words prakrteh kriyamanani, according to
the laws of nature one is controlled by the demigods. .
All living entities are serving Krsna in different ways, but when they
are Krsna conscious, their service is fully manifest. As a flower in the
bud gradually fructifies and yields its desired aroma and beauty, so when
a living entity comes to the platform of Krsna consciousness, the beauty
of his real form comes into full blossom. That is the ultimate beauty and
the ultimate fulfillment of desire.

the twenty-four elements for the creation of the material world,
headed by the mahat-tattva.

PURPORT

In this verse the word mahimabhih means aisvarya, or opulence. The
Supreme Personality of Godhead can do whatever He likes. That is His
aisvarya. No one can command Him, but He can command everyone.
Sad-aisvarya-pirnam. The Lord is full in six opulences. The yoga-sid-
dhis, the perfections of yoga, such as the ability to become smaller than
the smallest (anima-siddhi) or bigger than the biggest (mahima-siddhi),
are present in Lord Visnu. Sad-aisvaryaih [00700 ya iha bhagavan
(Cc. Adi 1.3). The word aja means mdyd, or mystic power. Everything
mysterious is in full existence in Vispu.

The twenty-four elements mentioned are the five working senses
(pafica-karmendriya), the five senses for obtaining knowledge (pafica-

five sense objects (parica-tanmatra), the mind (manas), the false ego
(aharikara), the mahat-tattva, and material nature (prakrti). All twenty-
four of these elements are employed for the manifestation of this ma-
terial world. The mahat-tattva is divided into different subtle categories,
but originally it is called the mahat-tattva.

TRANSLATION

Then Lord Brahma saw that kala (the time factor), svabhava
(one’s own nature by association), sarhskara (reformation), kama
(desire), karma (fruitive activity) and the gunas (the three modes
of material nature), their own independence being completely
subordinate to the potency of the Lord, had all taken forms and
were also worshiping those visnu-mirtis.

PURPORT

No one but Visnu has any independence. If we develop consciousness
of this fact, then we are in actual Krsna consciousness. We should always
remember that Krsna is the only supreme master and that everyone else
is His servant (ekale iSvara krsna, ara saba bhrtya). Be one even
Narayana or Lord Siva, everyone is subordinate to Krsna (Siva-virisici-
nutam). Even Baladeva is subordinate to Krsna. This is a fact.

ekale iSvara krsna, ara saba bhrtya
yare yaiche nacaya, se taiche kare nrtya
(Ce. Adi 5.142)
One should understand that no one is independent, for everything is part
and parcel of Krsna and is acting and moving by the supreme desire of
Krsna. This understanding, this consciousness, is Krsna consciousness.

“A person who considers demigods like Brahma and Siva to be on an
equal level with Narayana must certainly be considered an offender.” No
one can compare to Narayana, or Krsna. Krsna is Narayana, and
Narayana is also Krsna, for Krsna is the original Narayana. Brahma him-
self addresses Krsna, narayanas {एव na hi sarva-dehinam: “You are
also Narayana. Indeed, You are the original Narayana.” (Bhag. 10.14.14)

Kala, or the time factor, has many assistants, such as svabhava,
sammskara, kama, karma and guna. Svabhava, or one’s own nature, is

formed according to the association of the material qualities. Kara-
nam guna-sango ’sya sad-asad-yoni-janmasu (Bg. 13.22). Sat and asat-
svabhava— one’s higher or lower nature—is formed by association with
the different qualities, namely sattva-guna, rajo-guna and tamo-guna.
We should gradually come to the sattva-guna, so that we may avoid the
two lower gunas. This can be done if we regularly discuss Srimad-
Bhagavatam and hear about Krsna’s activities. Nasta-prayesv abhadresu
nityarn bhagavata-sevaya (Bhag. 1.2.18). All the activities of Krsna
described in Srimad-Bhagavatam, beginning even with the pastimes
concerning Pitana, are transcendental. Therefore, by hearing and dis-
cussing Srimad-Bhagavatam, the rajo-guna and tamo-guna are sub-
dued, so that only sattva-guna remains. Then rajo-guna and tamo-guna
cannot do us any harm.

Varnasrama-dharma, therefore, is essential, for it can bring peo-
ple to sattva-guna. Tada rajas-tamo-bhavah kama-lobhadayas ca ye
(Bhag.1.2.19). Tamo-guna and rajo-guna increase lust and greed,
which implicate a living entity in such a way that he must exist in this
material world in many, many forms. That is very dangerous. One
should therefore be brought to sattva-guna by the establishment of var-
nasrama-dharma and should develop the brahminical qualifications of
being very neat and clean, rising early in the morning and seeing
marigala-aratrika, and so on. In this way, one should stay in sattva-
guna, and then one cannot be influenced by tamo-guna and rajo-guna.

tada rajas-tamo-bhavah

The opportunity for this purification is the special feature of human life;
in other lives, this is not possible. Such purification can be achieved very
easily by radha-krsna-bhajana, devotional service rendered to Radha
and Krsna, and therefore Narottama dasa Thakura sings, hari hari
viphale janama gondinu, indicating that unless one worships Radha-
Krsna, one’s human form of life is wasted. Vasudeve bhagavati

engagement in the service of Vasudeva, one very quickly renounces ma-
terial life. The members of the Krsna consciousness movement, for ex-
ample, being engaged in vasudeva-bhakti, very quickly come to the stage
of being nice Vaisnavas, so much so that people are surprised that mlec-
chas and yavanas are able to come to this stage. This is possible by
vasudeva-bhakti. But if we do not come to the stage of sattva-guna in
this human life, then, as Narottama dasa Thakura sings, hari hari
viphale janama goriainu—there is no profit in gaining this human form
of life.

Sri Viraraghava Acarya comments that each of the items mentioned in
the first half of this verse is a cause for material entanglement. Kala, or
the time factor, agitates the modes of material nature, and svabhava is
the result of association with these modes. Therefore Narottama dasa
Thakura says, bhakta-sane vasa. If one associates with bhaktas, then
one’s svabhava, or nature, will change. Our Krsna consciousness move-
ment is meant to give people good association so that this change may
take place, and we actually see that by this method people all over the
world are gradually becoming devotees.

As for samskara, or reformation, this is possible by good association,
for by good association one develops good habits, and habit becomes sec-
ond nature. Therefore, bhakta-sane vasa: let people have the chance to
live with bhaktas. Then their habits will change. In the human form of
life one has this chance, but as Narottama dasa Thakura sings, hari hari
viphale janama gondinu: if one fails to take advantage of this oppor-
tunity, one’s human life is wasted. We are therefore trying to save
human society from degradation and actually elevate people to the higher
nature.

As for kama and karma—desires and activities—if one engages in de-
votional service, one develops a different nature than if one engages in
activities of sense gratification, and of course the result is also different.
According to the association of different natures, one receives a particu-
lar type of body. Karanam guna-sango ’sya sad-asad-yoni-janmasu
(Bg. 13.22). Therefore we should always seek good association, the
association of devotees. Then our life will be successful. A man is known
by his company. If one has the chance to live in the good association of
devotees, one is able to cultivate knowledge, and naturally one’s
character or nature will change for one’s eternal benefit.

Mere Sastra-jiana, or knowledge in the Vedas, does not help anyone
understand the Personality of Godhead. Only one who is favored or
shown mercy by the Lord can understand Him. This is also explained in
the Upanisads (Mundaka Up. 3.2.3):
nayam atma pravacanena labhyo
na medhasa na bahuna srutena
yam evaisa vrnute tena labhyas
tasyaisa atma vivrnute tanum svam
“The Supreme Lord is not obtained by expert explanations, by vast intel-
ligence, or even by much hearing. He is obtained only by one whom He
Himself chooses. To such a person, He manifests His own form.”


--- Page 67 ---
Text 54] Brahma Stealing the Boys and Calves 61

One description given of Brahman is satya brahma, ananda-riapam:
“Brahman is the Absolute Truth and complete ananda, or bliss.” The
forms of Visnu, the Supreme Brahman, were one, but They were
manifested differently. The followers of the Upanisads, however, cannot
understand the varieties manifested by Brahman. This proves that Brah-
man and Paramatma can actually be understood only through devotion,
as confirmed by the Lord Himself in Srimad-Bhagavatam (bhaktyaham
ekaya grahyah, Bhag. 11.14.21). To establish that Brahman indeed has
transcendental form, Srila Viévanatha Cakravarti Thakura gives various
quotations from the $astras. In the Svetasvatara Upanisad (3.8), the
Supreme is described as aditya-varnar tamasah parastat, “He whose
self-manifest form is luminous like the sun and transcendental to the
darkness of ignorance.” Ananda-matram ajaram puranam ekam san-
tam bahudha drsyamanam: “The Supreme is blissful, with no tinge of
unhappiness. Although He is the oldest, He never ages, and although
one, He is experienced in different forms.” Sarve nityah 5250८405 ca
dehds tasya paratmanah: “All the forms of that Supreme Person are
eternal.” (Maha-varaha Purana) The Supreme Person has a form, with
hands and legs and other personal features, but His hands and legs are
not material. Bhaktas know that the form of Krsna, or Brahman, is not at
all material. Rather, Brahman has a transcendental form, and when one
is absorbed in it, being fully developed in bhakti, one can understand
Him (premanjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena). The Mayavadis, how-
ever, cannot understand this transcendental form, for they think that it
is material.

Transcendental forms of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His
person are so great that the impersonal followers of the Upanisads cannot
reach the platform of knowledge to understand them. Particularly, the
transcendental forms of the Lord are beyond the reach of the imper-
sonalists, who can only understand, through the studies of the
Upanisads, that the Absolute Truth is not matter and that the Absolute
Truth is not materially restricted by limited potency.

Yet although Krsna cannot be seen through the Upanisads, in some
places it is said that Krsna can in fact be known in this way.
Aupanisadari purusam: “He is known by the Upanisads.”” This means
that when one is purified by Vedic knowledge, one is then allowed to
enter into devotional understanding (mad-bhaktir labhate param).

“The seriously inquisitive student or sage, well equipped with knowl-
edge and detachment, realizes that Absolute Truth by rendering devo-
tional service in terms of what he has heard from the Vedanta-sruti.”
(Bhag. 1.2.12) The word $ruta-grhitaya refers to Vedanta knowledge,
not sentimentality. Sruta-grhita is sound knowledge.

Lord Visnu, Brahma thus realized, is the reservoir of all truth, knowl-
edge and bliss. He is the combination of these three transcendental
features, and He is the object of worship for the followers of the
Upanisads. Brahma realized that all the different forms of cows, boys
and calves transformed into Visnu forms were not transformed by
mysticism of the type that a yogi or demigod can display by specific
powers invested in him. The cows, calves and boys transformed into
visnu-mirtis, or Visnu forms, were not displays of visnu-maya, or Visnu
energy, but were Visnu Himself. The respective qualifications of Visnu
and vispu-maya are just like those of fire and heat. In heat there is the
qualification of fire, namely warmth; and yet heat is not fire. The
manifestation of the Visnu forms of the boys, cows and calves was not
like the heat, but rather like the fire—they were all actually Visnu. Fac-
tually, the qualification of Visnu is full truth, full knowledge and full
bliss. Another example may be given with material objects, which may
be reflected in many, many forms. For example, the sun is reflected in
many waterpots, but the reflections of the sun in many pots are not ac-
tually the sun. There is no actual heat and light from the sun in the pot,
although it appears as the sun. But each and every one of the forms
Krsna assumed was fully Visnu.

We should discuss Srimad-Bhagavatam daily as much as possible, and
then everything will be clarified, for Bhagavatam is the essence of all
Vedic literature (nigama-kalpataror galitarh phalam). It was written by
Vyasadeva (mahamuni-krte) when he was self-realized. Thus the more
we read Srimad-Bhagavatam, the more its knowledge becomes clear.
Each and every verse is transcendental.

Then, by the power of the effulgence of those visnu-miirtis,
Lord Brahma, his eleven senses jolted by astonishment and
stunned by transcendental bliss, became silent, just like a child’s
clay doll in the presence of the village deity.

PURPORT

Brahma was stunned because of transcendental bliss (muhyanti yat
surayah). In his astonishment, all his senses were stunned, and he was
unable to say or do anything. Brahma had considered himself absolute,
thinking himself the only powerful deity, but now his pride was sub-
dued, and he again became merely one of the demigods—an important

त demigod, of course, but a demigod nonetheless. Brahma, therefore, can-
not be compared to God —Krsna, or Narayana. It is forbidden to compare
Narayana even to demigods like Brahma and Siva, what to speak of
others.

“One who considers demigods like Brahma and Siva to be on an equal

should not equate the demigods with Narayana, for even Sankaracarya
has forbidden this (narayanah paro *vyaktat). Also, as mentioned in the
Vedas, eko narayana asin na brahma nesanah: “In the beginning of cre-

no existence of Brahma or Siva.” Therefore, one who at the end of his

TRANSLATION

The Supreme Brahman is beyond mental speculation, He is self-
manifest, existing in His own bliss, and He is beyond the material
energy. He is known by the crest jewels of the Vedas by refutation
of irrelevant knowledge. Thus in relation to that Supreme Brah-
man, the Personality of Godhead, whose glory had been shown by
the manifestation of all the four-armed forms of Visnu, Lord
Brahma, the lord of Sarasvati, was mystified. ‘““What is this?” he
thought, and then he was not even able to see. Lord Krsna, under-
standing Brahma’s position, then at once removed the curtain of
His yogamaya.


--- Page 72 ---
66 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 10, Ch. 13
PURPORT

Brahma was completely mystified. He could not understand what he
was seeing, and then he was not even able to see. Lord Krsna, under-
standing Brahma’s position, then removed that yogamaya covering. In
this verse, Brahma is referred to as iresa. Ira means Sarasvati, the god-
dess of learning, and [7658 is her husband, Lord Brahma. Brahma,
therefore, is most intelligent. But even Brahma, the lord of Sarasvati,
was bewildered about Krsna. Although he tried, he could not understand
Lord Krsna. In the beginning the boys, the calves and Krsna Himself had
been covered by yogamaya, which later displayed the second set of
calves and boys, who were Krsna’s expansions, and which then displayed
so many four-armed forms. Now, seeing Brahma’s bewilderment, Lord
Krsna caused the disappearance of that yogamayd. One may think that
the maya taken away by Lord Krsna was mahamaya, but Srila
Viévanatha Cakravarti Thakura comments that it was yogamaya, the po-
tency by which Krsna is sometimes manifest and sometimes not
manifest. The potency which covers the actual reality and displays some-
thing unreal is mahamaya, but the potency by which the Absolute Truth
is sometimes manifest and sometimes not is yogamaya. Therefore, in
this verse the word aja refers to yogamaya.

Krsna’s energy —His maya-sakti, or svaripa-sakti—is one, but it is
manifested in varieties. Pardsya saktir vividhaiva srizyate (Svetasvatara
Up. 6.8). The difference between Vaisnavas and Mayavadis is that
Mayavadis say that this maya is one, whereas Vaisnavas recognize its
varieties. There is unity in variety. For example, in one tree, there are
varieties of leaves, fruits and flowers. Varieties of energy are required
for performing the varieties of activity within the creation. To give
another example, in a machine all the parts may be iron, but the machine
includes varied activities. Although the whole machine is iron, one part
works in one way, and other parts work in other ways. One who does not
know how the machine is working may say that it is all iron; nonetheless,
in spite of its being iron, the machine has different elements, all working
differently to accomplish the purpose for which the machine was made.
One wheel runs this way, another wheel runs that way, functioning
naturally in such a way that the work of the machine goes on. Conse-
quently we give different names to the different parts of the machine,
saying, “This is a wheel,” “This is a screw,” “This is a spindle,” “This


--- Page 73 ---
Text 57] Brahma Stealing the Boys and Calves 67
is the lubrication,” and so on. Similarly, as explained in the Vedas,

parasya Saktir vividhaiva $rivyate

svabhavikt jiana-bala-kriya ca

Krsna’s power is variegated, and thus the same Sakti, or potency, works
in variegated ways. Vividha means “varieties.” There is unity in variety.
Thus yogamaya and mahamaya are among the varied individual parts
of the same one potency, and all of these individual potencies work in
their own varied ways. The sarvit, sandhini and ahladini potencies —
Krsna’s potency for existence, His potency for knowledge and His po-
tency for pleasure —are distinct from yogamaya. Each is an individual
potency. The ahladini potency is Radharani. As Svaripa Damodara
Gosvami has explained, radha krsna-pranaya-vikrtir hladini Saktir
asmat (Cc. Adi 1.5). The ahladini-sakti is manifested as Radharani, but
Krsna and Radharani are the same, although one is potent and the other
is potency.

Brahma was mystified about Krsna’s opulence (nija-mahimani) be-
cause this opulence was atarkya, or inconceivable. With one’s limited
senses, one cannot argue about that which is inconceivable. Therefore
the inconceivable is called acintya, that which is beyond cintya, our
thoughts and arguments. Acintya refers to that which we cannot con-
template but have to accept. Srila Jiva Gosvami has said that unless we
accept acintya in the Supreme, we cannot accommodate the conception of
God. This must be understood. Therefore we say that the words of sastra
should be taken as they are, without change, since they are beyond our
arguments. Acintyah khalu ye bhava na tams tarkena yojayet: “That
which is acintya cannot be ascertained by argument.” People generally
argue, but our process is not to argue but to accept the Vedic knowledge
as it is. When Krsna says, “This is superior, and this is inferior,” we ac-
cept what He says. It is not that we argue, “Why is this superior and that
inferior?”” If one argues, for him the knowledge is lost.

This path of acceptance is called avaroha-pantha. The word avaroha
is related to the word avatara, which means “that which descends.” The
materialist wants to understand everything by the aroha-pantha—by
argument and reason —but transcendental matters cannot be understood
in this way. Rather, one must follow the avaroha-pantha, the process of


--- Page 74 ---
68 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 10, Ch. 13
descending knowledge. Therefore one must accept the parampara
system. And the best parampara is that which extends from Krsna
(evar parampara-praptam). What Krsna says, we should accept (imam
rajarsayo viduh). This is called the avaroha-pantha.

Brahma, however, adopted the aroha-pantha. He wanted to under-
stand Krsna’s mystic power by his own limited, conceivable power, and
therefore he himself was mystified. Everyone wants to take pleasure in
his own knowledge, thinking, “I know something.” But in the presence
of Krsna this conception cannot stand, for one cannot bring Krsna within
the limitations of prakrti. One must submit. There is no alternative. Na
tars tarkena yojayet. This submission marks the difference between
Krsna-ites and Mayavadis.

The phrase atan-nirasana refers to the discarding of that which is ir-
relevant. (Atat means “that which is not a fact.””) Brahman is some-
times described as asthiilam ananv ahrasvam adirgham, “that which is
not large and not small, not short and not long.” (Brhad-aranyaka
Up. 5.8.8) Neti neti: “It is not this, it is not that.” But what is it? In de-
scribing a pencil, one may say, “It is not this; it is not that,” but this does
not tell us what it is. This is called definition by negation. In Bhagavad-
gita, Krsna also explains the soul by giving negative definitions. Na
Jayate mriyate va: “It is not born, nor does it die. You can hardly under-
stand more than this.”” But what is it? It is eternal. Ajo nityah sasvato
’yarh purano na hanyate hanyamane Sarire: “It is unborn, eternal,
ever-existing, undying and primeval. It is not slain when the body is
slain.” (Bg. 2.20) In the beginning the soul is difficult to understand,
and therefore Krsna has given negative definitions:

nainam chindanti Sastrani
nainar dahati pavakah
na cainam kledayanty apo
na Sosayati marutah
“The soul can never be cut into pieces by any weapon, nor can it be
burned by fire, nor moistened by water, nor withered by the wind.”
(Bg. 2.23) Krsna says, “It is not burned by fire.”” Therefore, one has to
imagine what it is that is not burned by fire. This is a negative definition.

Lord Brahma’s external consciousness then revived, and he

We actually do not die. At death, we are merely kept inert for some
time, just as during sleep. At night we sleep, and all our activities stop,
but as soon as we arise, our memory immediately returns, and we think,
“Oh, where am 1? What do I have to १०२०० This is called suptotthita-
nyaya. Suppose we die. “Die” means that we become inert for some time
and then again begin our activities. This takes place life after life, ac-
cording to our karma, or activities, and svabhava, or nature by associa-
tion. Now, in the human life, if we prepare ourselves by beginning the
activity of our spiritual life, we return to our real life and attain perfec-
tion. Otherwise, according to karma, svabhava, prakrti and so on, our
varieties of life and activity continue, and so also do our birth and death.

form, and then one’s activities will be permanent. Krta-punya-punjah:
this stage is attained after one accumulates the results of pious
activities for many, many lives. Janma-koti-sukrtair na labhyate (Cc.
Madhya 8.70). The Krsna consciousness movement wants to stop koti-
janma, repeated birth and death. In one birth, one should rectify every-
thing and come to permanent life. This is Krsna consciousness.

Then, looking in all directions, Lord Brahma immediately saw

livelihood for the inhabitants and which were equally pleasing in
all seasons.

PURPORT

Janajivya-drumakirnam: trees and vegetables are essential, and they
give happiness all year round, in all seasons. That is the arrangement in
Vrndavana. It is not that in one season the trees are pleasing and
in another season not pleasing; rather, they are equally pleasing
throughout the seasonal changes. Trees and vegetables provide the real

TRANSLATION
Vrndavana is the transcendental abode of the Lord, where there
is no hunger, anger or thirst. Though naturally inimical, both
human beings and fierce animals live there together in transcen-
dental friendship.
PURPORT
The word vana means “forest.” We are afraid of the forest and do not
wish to go there, but in Vrndavana the forest animals are as good as
demigods, for they have no envy. Even in this material world, in the
forest the animals live together, and when they go to drink water they do
not attack anyone. Envy develops because of sense gratification, but in
Vrndavana there is no sense gratification, for the only aim is Krsna’s
satisfaction. Even in this material world, the animals in Vrndavana are
not envious of the sadhus who live there. The sadhus keep cows and sup-
ply milk to the tigers, saying, ‘Come here and take a little milk.” Thus
envy and malice are unknown in Vrndavana. That is the difference be-
tween Vrndavana and the ordinary world. We are horrified to hear the


--- Page 78 ---
72 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 10, Ch. 13
name of vana, the forest, but in Vrndavana there is no such horror.
Everyone there is happy by pleasing Krsna. Krsnotkirtana-gana-nar-
tana-parau. Whether a gosvami or a tiger or other ferocious animal,
everyone’s business is the same—to please Krsna. Even the tigers are
also devotees. This is the specific qualification of Vrndavana. In
Vrndavana everyone is happy. The calf is happy, the cat is happy, the
dog is happy, the man is happy —everyone. Everyone wants to serve
Krsna in a different capacity, and thus there is no envy. One may some-
times think that the monkeys in Vrndavana are envious, because they
cause mischief and steal food, but in Vrndivana we find that the
monkeys are allowed to take butter, which Krsna Himself distributes.
Krsna personally demonstrates that everyone has the right to live. This is
Vrndavana life. Why should I live and you die? No. That is material life.
The inhabitants of Vrndavana think, “Whatever is given by Krsna, let
us divide it as prasdda and eat.” This mentality cannot appear all of a
sudden, but it will gradually develop with Krsna consciousness; by
sadhana, one can come to this platform.

In the material world one may collect funds all over the world in order
to distribute food freely, yet those to whom the food is given may not
even feel appreciative. The value of Krsna consciousness, however, will
gradually be very much appreciated. For instance, in an article about the
temple of the Hare Krsna movement in Durban, South Africa, the Dur-
ban Post reported, “All the devotees here are very active in the service of
Lord Krsna, and the results are obvious to see: happiness, good health,
peace of mind, and the development of all good qualities.” This is the
nature of Vrndavana. Harav abhaktasya kuto mahad-gunah: without
Krsna consciousness, happiness is impossible; one may struggle, but one
cannot have happiness. We are therefore trying to give human society
the opportunity for a life of happiness, good health, peace of mind and all
good qualities through God consciousness.

tatra—there (in Vrndavana); udvahat—assuming; pasupa-varisa-
SiSutva-natyam—the play of being a child in a family of cowherd men
(another of Krsna’s names is Gopala, “He who maintains the cows”);
brahma—the Absolute Truth; advayam—without a second; param—
the Supreme; anantam—unlimited; agadha-bodham—possessing un-
limited knowledge; vatsan—the calves; sakhin—and His friends, the
boys; iva pura—just as before; paritah—everywhere; vicinvat—
searching; ekam—alone, all by Himself; sa-pani-kavalam—with a
morsel of food in His hand; paramesthi—Lord Brahma; acasta—saw.

TRANSLATION

Then Lord Brahma saw the Absolute Truth —who is one without
a second, who possesses full knowledge and who is unlimited —
assuming the role of a child in a family of cowherd men and stand-
ing all alone, just as before, with a morsel of food in His hand,
searching everywhere for the calves and His cowherd friends.

PURPORT

The word agadha-bodham, meaning “full of unlimited knowledge,”
is significant in this verse. The Lord’s knowledge is unlimited, and
therefore one cannot touch where it ends, just as one cannot measure the
ocean. What is the extent of our intelligence in comparison to the vast
expanse of water in the ocean? On my passage to America, how insignifi-
cant the ship was, like a matchbox in the midst of the ocean. Krsna’s in-
telligence resembles the ocean, for one cannot imagine how vast it is. The
best course, therefore, is to surrender to Krsna. Don’t try to measure
Krsna.

The word advayam, meaning ‘‘one without a second,” is also signifi-
cant. Because Brahma was overcast by Krsna’s maya, he was thinking
himself the Supreme. In the material world, everyone thinks, “I am the
best man in this world. I know everything.” One thinks, “Why should I
read Bhagavad-gita? 1 know everything. I have my own interpretation.”


--- Page 80 ---
74 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 10, Ch. 13
Brahma, however, was able to understand that the Supreme Personality
is Krsna. Isvarah paramah krsnah. Another of Krsna’s names, therefore,
is paramesvara.

Now Brahma saw Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, appear-
ing as a cowherd boy in Vrndavana, not demonstrating His opulence but
standing just like an innocent boy with some food in His hand, loitering
with His cowherd boyfriends, calves and cows. Brahma did not see Krsna
as catur-bhuja, the opulent Narayana; rather, he simply saw an innocent
boy. Nonetheless, he could understand that although Krsna was not
demonstrating His power, He was the same Supreme Person. People
generally do not appreciate someone unless he shows something wonder-
ful, but here, although Krsna did not manifest anything wonderful,
Brahma could understand that the same wonderful person was present
like an ordinary child, although He was the master of the whole creation.
Thus Brahma prayed, govindam adi-purusari tam 0110772 bhajami: “You
are the original person, the cause of everything. I bow down to You.”
This was his realization. Tam aha bhajami. This is what is wanted.
Vedesu durlabham: one cannot reach Krsna merely by Vedic knowledge.
Adurlabham atma-bhaktau: but when one becomes a devotee, then one
can realize Him. Brahma, therefore, became a devotee. In the beginning
he was proud of being Brahma, the lord of the universe, but now he
understood, “Here is the Lord of the universe. I am simply an insignifi-
cant agent. Govindam adi-purusari tam 00772 bhajami.”

Krsna was playing like a dramatic actor. Because Brahma had some
false prestige, thinking that he had some power, Krsna showed him his
real position. A similar incident occurred when Brahma went to see
Krsna in Dvaraka. When Krsna’s doorman informed Lord Krsna that
Lord Brahma had arrived, Krsna responded, “Which Brahma? Ask him
which Brahma.” The doorman relayed this question, and Brahma was
astonished. “Is there another Brahma besides me?”’ he thought. When
the doorman informed Lord Krsna, ‘It is four-headed Brahma,” Lord
Krsna said, “Oh, four-headed. Call others. Show him.”” This 15 Krsna’s
position. For Krsna the four-headed Brahma is insignificant, to say
nothing of “four-headed scientists.” Materialistic scientists think that al-
though this planet earth is full of opulence, all others are vacant. Because
they simply speculate, this is their scientific conclusion. But from the
Bhagavatam we understand that the entire universe is full of living en-


--- Page 81 ---
Text 62] Brahma Stealing the Boys and Calves 75
tities everywhere. Thus it is the folly of the scientists that although they
do not know anything, they mislead people by presenting themselves as
scientists, philosophers and men of knowledge.

TRANSLATION
After seeing this, Lord Brahma hastily got down from his swan
carrier, fell down like a golden rod and touched the lotus feet of
Lord Krsna with the tips of the four crowns on his heads. Offering
his obeisances, he bathed the feet of Krsna with the water of his
tears of joy.
PURPORT
Lord Brahma bowed down like a stick, and because Lord Brahma’s
complexion is golden, he appeared to be like a golden stick lying down
before Lord Krsna. When one falls down before a superior just like a
stick, one’s offering of obeisances is called dandavat. Danda means


--- Page 82 ---
76 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 10, Ch. 13
“stick,” and vat means “like.” It is not that one should simply say,
““dandavat.” Rather, one must fall down. Thus Brahma fell down, touch-
ing his foreheads to the lotus feet of Krsna, and his crying in ecstasy is to
be regarded as an abhiseka bathing ceremony of Krsna’s lotus feet.

He who appeared before Brahma as a human child was in fact the Ab-
solute Truth, Parabrahman (brahmeti paramatmeti bhagavan iti sabd-
yate). The Supreme Lord is narakrti; that is, He resembles a human
being. It is not that He is four-armed (catur-bahu). Narayana is catur-
bahu, but the Supreme Person resembles a human being. This is also
confirmed in the Bible, where it is said that man was made in the image
of God.

Lord Brahma saw that Krsna, in His form as a cowherd boy, was
Parabrahman, the root cause of everything, but was now appearing as a
human child, loitering in Vrndavana with a morsel of food in His hand.
Astonished, Lord Brahma hastily got down from his swan carrier and let
his body fall to the earth. Usually, the demigods never touch the ground,
but Lord Brahma, voluntarily giving up his prestige as a demigod, bowed
down on the ground before Krsna. Although Brahma has one head in
each direction, he voluntarily brought all his heads to the ground and
touched Krsna’s feet with the tips of his four helmets. Although his in-
telligence works in every direction, he surrendered everything before
the boy Krsna.

It is mentioned that Brahma washed the feet of Krsna with his tears,
and here the word sujalaih indicates that his tears were purified. As soon
as bhakti is present, everything is purified (sarvopadhi-vinirmuktam).
Therefore Brahma’s crying was a form of bhakty-anubhava, a transfor-
mation of transcendental ecstatic love.

Rising and falling again and again at the lotus feet of Lord Krsna
for a long time, Lord Brahma remembered over and over the
Lord’s greatness he had just seen.

As stated in one prayer,

“Let others study the Vedas, smrti and Mahabharata, fearing material
existence, but I shall worship Nanda Maharaja, in whose courtyard is
crawling the Supreme Brahman. Nanda Maharaja is so great that the
Parabrahman is crawling in his yard, and therefore I shall worship him.”
(Padyavali 126)

Brahma was falling down in ecstasy. Because of the presence of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, who exactly resembled a human child,
Brahma was naturally astonished. Therefore with a faltering voice he
offered prayers, understanding that here was the Supreme Person.

TRANSLATION

Then, rising very gradually and wiping his two eyes, Lord
Brahma looked up at Mukunda. Lord Brahma, his head bent low,
his mind concentrated and his body trembling, very humbly
began, with faltering words, to offer praises to Lord Krsna.

PURPORT

Brahma, being very joyful, began to shed tears, and he washed the
lotus feet of Krsna with his tears. Repeatedly he fell and rose as he
recalled the wonderful activities of the Lord. After repeating obeisances
for a long time, Brahma stood up and smeared his hands over his eyes.
Srila Viévanatha Cakravarti Thaikura comments that the word locane in-
dicates that with his two hands he wiped the two eyes on each of his four
faces. Seeing the Lord before him, Brahma began to offer prayers with
great humility, respect and attention.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Tenth Canto, Thirteenth
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled ‘The Stealing of the Boys
and Calves by Brahma.”

The Author

His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada appeared in
this world in 1896 in Calcutta, India. He first met his spiritual master,
Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami, in Calcutta in 1922. Bhakti-
siddhanta Sarasvati, a prominent religious scholar and the founder of
sixty-four Gaudiya Mathas (Vedic institutes), liked this educated young
man and convinced him to dedicate his life to teaching Vedic knowledge.
Srila Prabhupiada became his student, and eleven years later (1933) at
Allahabad he became his formally initiated disciple.

At their first meeting, in 1922, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati
Thakura requested Srila Prabhupada to broadcast Vedic knowledge
through the English language. In the years that followed, Srila Prabhu-
pada wrote a commentary on the Bhagavad-gita, assisted the Gaudiya
Matha in its work and, in 1944, without assistance, started an English
fortnightly magazine, edited it, typed the manuscripts and checked the
galley proofs. He even distributed the individual copies and struggled to
maintain the publication. Once begun, the magazine never stopped; it is
now being continued by his disciples in the West and is published in
nineteen languages.

Recognizing Srila Prabhupada’s philosophical learning and devo-
tion, the Gaudiya Vaisnava Society honored him in 1947 with the title
“Bhaktivedanta.” In 1950, at the age of fifty-four, Srila Prabhupada
retired from married life, adopting the vanaprastha (retired) order to
devote more time to his studies and writing. Srila Prabhupada traveled to
the holy city of Vrndavana, where he lived in very humble circum-
stances in the historic medieval temple of Radha-Damodara. There he
engaged for several years in deep study and writing. He accepted the re-
nounced order of life (sannydsa) in 1959. At Radha-Damodara, Srila
Prabhupada began work on his life’s masterpiece: a multivolume trans-
lation of and commentary on the eighteen-thousand-verse Srimad-
Bhagavatam (Bhagavata Purana). He also wrote Easy Journey to Other
Planets.

After publishing three volumes of the Bhagavatam, Srila Prabhupada
came to the United States, in 1965, to fulfill the mission of his spiritual
master. Subsequently, His Divine Grace wrote more than sixty volumes

80


--- Page 87 ---
The Author 81
of authoritative translations, commentaries and summary studies of the
philosophical and religious classics of India.

In 1965, when he first arrived by freighter in New York City, Srila
Prabhupada was practically penniless. It was after almost a year of great
difficulty that he established the International Society for Krishna Con-
sciousness in July of 1966. Before his passing away on November 14,
1977, he guided the Society and saw it grow to a worldwide confederation
of more than one hundred asramas, schools, temples, institutes and farm
communities,

In 1968, Srila Prabhupada created New Vrindaban, an experimental
Vedic community in the hills of West Virginia. Inspired by the success of
New Vrindaban, now a thriving farm community of more than one thou-
sand acres, his students have since founded several similar communities
in the United States and abroad.

In 1972, His Divine Grace introduced the Vedic system of primary and
secondary education in the West by founding the Gurukula school in
Dallas, Texas. Since then, under his supervision, his disciples have
established children’s schools throughout the United States and the rest
of the world. As of 1978, there are ten gurukula schools worldwide, with
the principal educational center now located in Vrndavana, India.

Srila Prabhupada also inspired the construction of several large inter-
national cultural centers in India. The center at Sridhama Mayapur in
West Bengal is the site for a planned spiritual city, an ambitious project
for which construction will extend over the next decade. In Vrndavana,
India, is the magnificent Krsna-Balarama Temple and International
Guesthouse. There is also a major cultural and educational center in
Bombay. Other centers are planned in a dozen other important locations
on the Indian subcontinent.

Srila Prabhupada’s most significant contribution, however, is his
books. Highly respected by the academic community for their authori-
tativeness, depth and clarity, they are used as standard textbooks in
numerous college courses. His writings have been translated into twenty-
eight languages. The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, established in 1972 ex-
clusively to publish the works of His Divine Grace, has thus become the
world’s largest publisher of books in the field of Indian religion and
philosophy.

In just twelve years, in spite of his advanced age, Srila Prabhupada
circled the globe fourteen times on lecture tours that took him to six con-
tinents. In spite of such a vigorous schedule, Srila Prabhupada continued
to write prolifically. His writings constitute a veritable library of Vedic
philosophy, religion, literature and culture.

There is no strong accentuation of syllables in Sanskrit, or pausing
between words in a line, only a flowing of short and long (twice as
long as the short) syllables. A long syllable is one whose vowel is
long (a, i, च+ €+ ai, 0, au), or whose short vowel is followed by more
than one consonant (including anusvara and visarga). Aspirated
consonants (such as kha and gha) count as only single consonants.

““The Srimad-Bhagavatam is widely acclaimed as
the bible of Indian devotionalism par excellence. His
Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhu-
pada has produced an exquisite edition of the
Bhagavatam with English translation and commen-
tary. Through his lucid commentary, the author
reveals the real spirit of the text. The profound es-
sence of bhakti, divine love, radiates from every
page. The physical layout of these volumes and the
many beautiful illustrations are pleasing to the eye as
well as to the mind.”

Dr. T.M.P. Mahadevan

Chief, Oriental Division

““It has been my great pleasure recently to have
read the Srimad-Bhagavatam in the superb edition
authorized by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhu-
pada. The consummate care and devotion to the
Sanskrit word and its precious meaning are evident
on every page. I am sure this monumental work will
go far to bring the sublime message of the
Bhagavatam to numerous Westerners who otherwise
would miss this opportunity.”’
