Preface

We must know the present need of human society. And what is that
need? Human society is no longer bounded by geographical limits to
particular countries or communities. Human society is broader than in the
Middle Ages, and the world tendency is toward one state or one human
society. The ideals of spiritual communism, according to Srimad-
Bhégavatam, are based more or less on the oneness of the entire human
society, nay, on the entire energy of living beings. The need is felt by great
thinkers to make this a successful ideology. द्य Bhagavatam will fill
this need in human society. It begins, therefore, with the aphorism of
Vedanta philosophy (janmady asya yatah) to establish the ideal of a
common cause.

Human society, at the present moment, is not in the darkness of
oblivion. It has made rapid progress in the field of material comforts,
education and economic development throughout the entire world. But
there is a pinprick somehwere in the social body at large, and therefore
there are large-scale quarrels, even over less important issues. There is need
of a clue as to how humanity can become one in peace, friendship and
prosperity with a common cause. Srimad-Bhagavatam will fill this need,
for it is a cultural presentation for the re-spiritualization of the entire
human society.

Srimad-Bhagavatam should be introduced also in the schools and col-
leges, for it is recommended by the great student devotee Prahlada
Maharaja in order to change the demonic face of society.

Disparity in human society is due to lack of principles in a godless
civilization. There is God, or the Almighty One, from whom everything
emanates, by whom everything is maintained and in whom everything is
merged to rest. Material science has tried to find the ultimate source of
creation very insufficiently, but it is a fact that there is one ultimate source

1


--- Page 2 ---
2 Srimad-Bhagavatam
of everything that be. This ultimate source is explained rationally and
authoritatively in the beautiful Bhagavatam or Srimad-Bhagavatam.

Srimad-Bhagavatam is the transcendental science not only for knowing
the ultimate source of everything but also for knowing our relation with
Him and our duty towards perfection of the human society on the basis of
this perfect knowledge. It is powerful reading matter in the Sanskrit
language, and it is now rendered into English elaborately so that simply by
a careful reading one will know God perfectly well, so much so that the
reader will be sufficiently educated to defend himself from the onslaught
of atheists. Over and above this, the reader will be able to convert
others to accept God as a concrete principle.

S$rimad-Bhagavatam begins with the definition of the ultimate source.
It is a bona fide commentary on the Vedanta-siitra by the same author,
Srila Vyasadeva, and gradually it develops into nine cantos up to the
highest state of God realization. The only qualification one needs to study
this great book of transcendental knowledge is to proceed step by step
cautiously and not jump forward haphazardly like with an ordinary book.
It should be gone through chapter by chapter, one after another. The
reading matter is so arranged with its original Sanskrit text, its English
transliteration, synonyms, translation and purports so that one is sure to
become a God realized soul at the end of finishing the first nine cantos.

The Tenth Canto is distinct from the first nine cantos, because it deals
directly with the transcendental activities of the Personality of Godhead
Sri Krsna. One will be unable to capture the effects of the Tenth Canto
without going through the first nine cantos. The book is complete in
twelve cantos, each independent, but it is good for all to read them in
small installments one after another.

I must admit my frailties in presenting Srimad-Bhagavatam, but still 1
am hopeful of its good reception by the thinkers and leaders of society on
the strength of the following statement of Srimad-Bhagavatam.

tad vagvisargo janatagha-viplavo
yasmin pratislokam abaddhavaty api
namany anantasya yaso ‘nkitani yac
chrnvanti gayanti grnanti sadhavah
(Bhag. 1.5.11)

“On the other hand, that literature which is full with descriptions of

the transcendental glories of the name, fame, form and pastimes of the

unlimited Supreme Lord is a transcendental creation meant to bring about
a revolution in the impious life of a misdirected civilization. Such tran-
scendental literatures, even though irregularly composed, are heard, sung
and accepted by purified men who are thoroughly honest.”

Introduction

The conception of God and the conception of Absolute Truth are not
on the same level. The Srimad-Bhdgavatam hits on the target of the
Absolute Truth. The conception of God indicates the controller, whereas
the conception of the Absolute Truth indicates the summum bonum or
the ultimate source of all energies. There is no difference of opinion about
the personal feature of God as the controller because a controller cannot
be impersonal. Of course modern government, especially democratic
government, is impersonal to some extent, but ultimately the chief
executive head is a person, and the impersonal feature of government is
subordinate to the personal feature. So without a doubt whenever we refer
to control over others we must admit the existence of a personal feature.
Because there are different controllers for different managerial positions,
there may be many small gods. According to the Bhagavad-gita any
controller who has some specific extraordinary power is called a vibhiiti-
mat sattva, or controller empowered by the Lord. There are many vibhiiti-
mat sattvas, controllers or gods with various specific powers, but the
Absolute Truth is one without a second. This Srimad-Bhagavatam desig-
nates the Absolute Truth or the summum bonum as the param satyam.

The author of Srimad-Bhagavatam, Srila Vyasadeva, first offers his
respectful obeisances unto the param satyam (Absolute Truth), and be-
cause the param satyam is the ultimate source of all energies, the param
satyam is the Supreme Person. The gods or the controllers are undoubtedly
persons, but the param satyam from whom the gods derive powers of
control is the Supreme Person. The Sanskrit word vara (controller)
conveys the import of God, but the Supreme Person is called the param-
esvara, or the supreme (88৫70. The Supreme Person or paramesvara is the
supreme conscious personality, and because He does not derive any power
from any other source, He is supremely independent. In the Vedic litera-
tures Brahma is described as the supreme god or the head of all other gods
like Indra, Candra, Varuna, etc., but the Srimad-Bhagavatam confirms that
even Brahma is not independent as far as his power and knowledge are
concerned. He received knowledge in the form of the Vedas from the
Supreme Person who resides within the heart of every living being. That
Supreme Personality knows everything directly and indirectly. Individual
infinitesimal persons, who are parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality,
may know directly and indirectly everything about their bodies or external

5

features, but the Supreme Personality knows everything about both His
external and internal features.

The words janmady asya suggest that the source of all production,
maintenance or destruction is the same supreme conscious person. Even in
our present experience we can know that nothing is generated from inert
matter, but inert matter can be generated from the living entity. For in-
stance, by contact with the living entity, the material body develops into a
working machine. Men with a poor fund of knowledge mistake the bodily
machinery to be the living being, but the fact is that the living being is the
basis of the bodily machine. The bodily machine is useless as soon as the
living spark is away from it. Similarly, the original source of all material
energy is the Supreme Person. This fact is expressed in all the Vedic litera-
tures, and all the exponents of spiritual science have accepted this truth.
The living force is called Brahman, and one of the greatest acaryas (teach-
ers), namely Sripada Sankaracarya, has preached that Brahman is substance
whereas the cosmic world is category. The original source of all energies is
the living force, and He is logically accepted as the Supreme Person. He is
therefore conscious of everything past, present and future, and also of each
and every corner of His manifestations, both material and spiritual. An im-
perfect living being does not even know what is happening within his own
personal body. He eats his food but does not know how this food is trans-
formed into energy or how it sustains his body. When a living being is per-
fect, he is aware of everything that happens, and since the Supreme Person
is all-perfect, it is quite natural that He knows everything in all detail. Con-
sequently the perfect personality is addressed in the Srimad-Bhagavatam
as Vasudeva, or one who lives everywhere in full consciousness and in full
१ of His complete energy. All of this is clearly explained in the

rimad-Bhagavatam, and the reader has ample opportunity to study this
critically.

In the modern age Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu preached the Srimad-
Bhagavatam by practical demonstration. It is easier to penetrate into the
topics of the Srimad-Bhagavatam through the medium of Sti Caitanya’s
causeless mercy. Therefore a short sketch of His life and precepts is in-
serted herein to help the reader understand the real merit of Srimad-
Bhagavatam.

It is imperative that one learn the Srimad-Bhagavatam from the person
Bhagavatam. The person Bhagavatam is one whose very life is Srimad-
Bhagavatam in practice. Since Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is the Absolute
Personality of Godhead, He is both Bhagavan and Bhagavatam in person
and in sound. Therefore His process of approaching the Srimad-Bhagavatam


--- Page 6 ---
Introduction 7
is practical for all the people of the world. It was His wish that the
Srimad-Bhagavatam be preached in every nook and corner of the world by
those who happened to take their birth in India.

The Srimad-Bhagavatam is the science of Krsna, the Absolute Personality
of Godhead of whom we have preliminary information from the text of
the Bhagavad-gita. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has said that anyone, regard-
less of what he is, who is well versed in the science of Krsna (Srimad-
Bhagavatam and Bhagavad-gitd) can become an authorized preacher or
preceptor in the science of Krsna.

There is a need for the science of Krsna in human society for the good
of all suffering humanity of the world, and we simply request the leaders
of all nations to pick up this science of Krsna for their own good, for the
good of society and for the good of all the world’s people.

A SHORT SKETCH OF THE LIFE AND TEACHINGS OF LORD
CAITANYA, THE PREACHER OF SRIMAD-BHAGAVATAM

Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, the great apostle of love of God and the
father of the congregational chanting of the holy name of the Lord,
advented Himself at Sridhama Mayapura,a quarter in the city of Navadvipa
in Bengal, on the Phalguni Pirnima evening in the year 1407 Sakabda
(corresponding to February 1486 by the Christian calendar).

His father, Sti Jagannatha Miéra, a learned brahmapa from the district
of Sylhet, came to Navadvipa as a student because at that time Navadvipa
was considered to be the center of education and culture. He domiciled on
the banks of the Ganges after marrying Srimati Sacidevi, a daughter of
Srila Nilambara Cakravarti, the great learned scholar of Navadvipa.

Jagannatha Misra had a number of daughters by his wife Srimati
Sacidevi, and most of them expired at an early age. Two surviving sons,
Sri Vigvariipa and Visvambhara, became at last the object of their paternal
affection. The tenth and youngest son, who was named Viévambhara, later
became known as Nimai Pandit and then, after accepting the renounced
order of life, Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.

Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu exhibited His transcendental activities
for forty-eight years and then disappeared in the year 1455 Sakabda at
Puri.

For His first twenty-four years He remained at Navadvipa as a student
and householder. His first wife was Srimati Laksmipriya, who died at an
early age when the Lord was away from home. When He returned from


--- Page 7 ---
\
8 Srimad-Bhagavatam
East Bengal He was requested by His mother to accept a second wife, and
He agreed. His second wife was Srimati Visnupriya Devi, who bore the
separation of the Lord throughout her life because the Lord took the order
of sannydsa at the age of twenty-four when Srimati Visnupriya was barely
sixteen years old.

After taking sannydsa, the Lord made His headquarters at Jagannatha
Puri due to the request of His mother, Srimati Sacidevi. The Lord remained
for twenty-four years at Purl. For six years of this time He travelled
continuously all over India (and especially throughout southern India)
preaching the Srimad-Bhagavatam.

Lord Caitanya not only preached the Srimad-Bhagavatam but propa-
gated the teaching of the Bhagavad-gita as well in the most practical way.
In the Bhagavad-gita Lord Sri Krsna is depicted as the Absolute Personality
of Godhead, and His last teachings in that great book of transcendental
knowledge instruct that one should give up all the modes of religious
activities and accept Him (Lord Sri Krsna) as the only worshipable Lord.
The Lord then assured that all His devotees would be protected from all
sorts of sinful acts and that for them there would be no cause for anxiety.

Unfortunately, despite Lord Sri Krsna’s direct order and the teachings
of the Bhagavad-gita, less intelligent people misunderstand Him to be
nothing but a great historical personality, and thus they cannot accept
Him as the original Personality of Godhead. Such men with a poor fund
of knowledge are misled by many nondevotees. Thus the teachings of the
Bhagavad-gita were misinterpreted even by great scholars. After the disap-
pearance of Lord Sti Krsna there were hundreds of commentaries on the
Bhagavad-gita by many erudite scholars, and almost every one of them was
motivated by self-interest.

Lord SriCaitanya Mahaprabhu is the selfsame Lord Sri Krsna. This time,
however, He appeared as a great devotee of the Lord in order to preach
to the people in general, as well as to religionists and philosophers, about
the transcendental position of Sr Krsna, the primeval Lord and the cause
of all causes. The essence of His preaching is that Lord Sti Krsna, who
appeared at Vrajabhiimi (Vrndavana) as the son of the King of Vraja
(Nanda Maharaja), is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and is therefore
worshipable by all. Vrndavana-dhama is nondifferent from the Lord because
the name, fame, form and place where the Lord manifests Himself are all
identical with the Lord as absolute knowledge. Therefore Vrndavana-dhama
is as worshipable as the Lord. The highest form of transcendental worship
of the Lord was exhibited by the damsels of Vrajabhiimi in the form of
pure affection for the Lord, and Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu recom-

Introduction 9
mends this process as the most excellent mode of worship. He accepts the
$rimad-Bhagavata Purina as the spotless literature for understanding the
Lord, and He preached that the ultimate goal of life for all human beings
is to attain the stage of prema or love of God.

Many devotees of Lord Caitanya like Srila Vrndavana-dasa Thakur, Sri
Locanadasa Thakur, Srila Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami, Sri Kavikarnapiira,
Sri Prabodhananda Sarasvati, Sri Ripa Gosvami, Sri Sanatana Gosvami,
Sri Raghunitha Bhatta Gosvami, इपर Jiva Gosvami, Sri Gopila Bhatta
Gosvami, SH Raghunitha Dasa Gosvami and in this latter age within two
hundred years, & Vigvanitha Cakravarti, Sri Baladeva Vidyabhiisana, Sri
Syamananda Gosvami, Sri Narottama-dasa Thakur, Sri Bhaktivinode Thakur
and at last Sri Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur (our spiritual master) and
many other great and renowned scholars and devotees of the Lord, have
prepared voluminous books and literatures on the life and precepts of the
Lord. Such literatures are all based on the $astras like the Vedas, Puranas,
Upanisads, Ramayana, Mahabharata and other histories and authentic
literatures approved by the recognized dcaryas. They are unique in com-
position and unrivaled in presentation, and they are full of transcendental
knowledge. Unfortunately the people of the world are still ignorant of
them, but when these literatures, which are mostly in Sanskrit and Bengali,
come to light the world and when they are presented before thinking
people, then India’s glory and the message of love will overflood this
morbid world, which is vainly searching after peace and prosperity by
various illusory methods not approved by the dciryas in the chain of
disciplic succession.

The readers of this small description of the life and precepts of Lord
Caitanya will profit much to go through the books of Srila Vrndavana-dasa
Thakur (Sri Caitanya-bhigavata) and Srila Krspadasa Kavirdja Gosvami
(ग Caitanya-caritimrta). The early life of the Lord is most fascinatingly
expressed by the author of Caitanya-bhagavata, and as far as the teachings
are concerned, they are more vividly explained in the Caitanya-caritamrta.
Now they are available to the English speaking public in our Teachings
of Lord Caitanya.

The Lord’s early life was recorded by one of His chief devotees and
contemporaries, namely Srila Murari Gupta, a medical practitioner of that
time, and the latter part of the life of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu was
recorded by His private secretary Sri Damodara Gosvami or Srila Svariipa
Damodara, who was practically a constant companion of the Lord at Puri.
These two devotees recorded practically all the incidences of the Lord’s
activities, and later on all thebooks dealing with the Lord, which are above


--- Page 9 ---
10 Srimad-Bhagavatam
mentioned, were composed on the basis of karcas by Srila Damodara
Gosvami and Murari Gupta.

So the Lord advented Himself on the Phalguni Piirnima evening of 1407
Sakabda, and it was by the will of the Lord that there was a lunar eclipse
on that evening. During the hours of eclipse it was the custom of the
Hindu public to take bath in the Ganges or any other sacred river and
chant the Vedic mantras for purification. When Lord Caitanya was born
during the lunar eclipse, all India was roaring with the holy sound of Hare
Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama
Rama, Hare Hare. These sixteen names of the Lord are mentioned in many
Puranas and Upanisads, and they are described as the Taraka-Brahman-
Nama of this age. It is recommended in the sastras that offenseless chanting
of these holy names of the Lord can deliver a fallen soul from material
bondage. There are innumerable names of the Lord both in India and
outside, and all of them are equally good because all of them indicate the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. But because these sixteen are especially
recommended for this age, people should take advantage of them and
follow the path of the great acaryas who attained success by practicing the
rules of the $astras (revealed scriptures).

The simultaneous occurrence of the Lord’s appearance and the lunar
eclipse indicated the distinctive mission of the Lord. This mission was to
preach the importance of chanting the holy names of the Lord in this age
of Kali (quarrel). In this present age quarrels take place even over trifles,
and therefore the sastras have recommended for this age a common plat-
form for realization, namely chanting the holy names of the Lord. People
can hold meetings to glorify the Lord in their respective languages and
with melodious songs, and if such performances are executed in an offense-
less manner, it is certain that the participants will gradually attain spiritual
perfection without having to undergo more rigorous methods. At such
meetings everyone, the leaned and the foolish, the rich and the poor, the
Hindus and the Muslims, the Englishman and the Indians, and the candala
and the brihmanas, can all hear the transcendental sounds and thus cleanse
the dust of material association from the mirror of the heart. To confirm
the Lord’s mission all the people of the world will accept the holy name of
the Lord as the common platform for the universal religion of mankind.
In other words, the advent of the holy name took place along with the
advent of Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.

When the Lord was on the lap of His mother, He would at once stop
crying as soon as the ladies surrounding Him chanted the holy names and
clapped their hands. This peculiar incidence was observed by the neighbors


--- Page 10 ---
Introduction 11
with awe and veneration. Sometimes the young girls took pleasure in
making the Lord cry and then stopping Him by chanting the holy name.
So from His very childhood the Lord began to preach the importance of
the holy name. In His early age Lord Sri Caitanya was known as Nimai.
This name was given by His beloved mother because the Lord took His
birth beneath a nim tree in the courtyard of His paternal house.

When the Lord was offered solid food at the age of six months in the
anna-prasana ceremony, the Lord indicated His future activities. At this
time it was customary to offer the child both coins and books in order to
get some indication of the future tendencies of the child. The Lord was
offered on one side coins and on the other the Srimad-Bhagavatam. The
Lord accepted the Bhagavatam instead of the coins.

When He was a mere baby crawling in the yard, one day a snake ap-
peared before Him, and the Lord began to play with it. All the members
of the house were struck with fear and awe, but after alittle while the snake
went away, and the baby was taken away by His mother. Once He was
stolen by a thief who intended to steal His ornaments, but the Lord took
a pleasure trip on the shoulder of the bewildered thief who was searching
for a solitary place in order to rob the baby. It so happened that the thief,
wandering hither and thither, finally arrived just before the house of
Jagannatha Misra and, being afraid of being caught, dropped the baby at
once. Of course the anxious parents and relatives were glad to see the lost
child.

Once a pilgrim bradhmana was received at the house of Jagannatha Misra,
and when he was offering food to the Godhead, the Lord appeared before
him and partook of the prepared food. The eatables had to be rejected
because the child touched them, and so the brahmana had to make
another preparation. The next time the same thing happened, and when
this happened repeatedly for the third time, the baby was finally put to
bed. At about twelve at night when all the members of the house were fast
asleep within their closed rooms, the pilgrim brahmana offered his specially
prepared foods to the Deity, and, in the same way, the baby Lord appeared
before the pilgrim and spoiled his offerings. The brahmana then began to
cry, but since everyone was fast asleep, no one could hear him. At that
time the baby Lord appeared before the fortunate brahmana and disclosed
His identity as Krsna Himself. The brahmana was forbidden to disclose this
incidence, and the baby returned to the lap of His mother.

There are many similar incidences in His childhood. As a naughty boy
He sometimes used to tease the orthodox brahmanas who used to bathe in
the Ganges. When the brahmanas complained to His father that He was


--- Page 11 ---
12 Srimad-Bhagavatam

splashing them with water instead of attending school, the Lord suddenly
appeared before His father as though just coming from school with all His
school clothes and books. At the bathing ghat He also used to play jokes
on the neighboring girls who engaged in worshiping Siva in hopes of getting
good husbands. This is a common practice amongst unmarried girls in
Hindu families. While they were engaged in such worship, the Lord
naughtily appeared before them and said, “My dear sisters, please give Me
all the offerings you have just brought for Lord Siva. Lord Siva is My
devotee, and Parvati is My maidservant. If you worship Me, then Lord
Siva and all the other demigods will be more satisfied.” Some of them
refused to obey the naughty Lord, and He would curse them that due to
their refusal they would be married to old men who had seven children by
their previous wives. Out of fear and sometimes out of love the girls would
also offer Him various goods, and then the Lord would bless them and as-
sure them that they would have very good young husbands and that they
would be mothers of dozens of children. The blessings would enliven the
girls, but they used often to complain of these incidences to their mothers.

In this way the Lord passed His early childhood. When He was just
sixteen years old He started His own catugpathi (village school conducted
by a learned brahmana). In this school He would simply explain Krsna,
even in readings of grammar. Srila Jiva Gosvami, in order to please the
Lord, later composed a grammar in Sanskrit, in which all the rules of
grammar were explained with examples that used the holy names of the
Lord. This grammar is still current. It is known as Hari-namamrta-vyakarana
and is prescribed in the syllabus of schools in Bengal.

During this time a great Kashmir scholar named Kesava Ka$mirl
came to Navadvipa to hold discussions on the $astras. The Kashmir pan-
dit was a champion scholar, and he had travelled to all places of learning in
India. Finally he came to Navadvipa to contest the learned pandits there.
The pandits of Navadvipa decided to match Nimai Pandit (Lord Caitanya)
with the Kashmir Pandit, thinking that if Nimai Pandit were defeated,
they would have another chance to debate with the scholar, for Nimai
Pandit was only a boy. And if the Kashmir Pandit were defeated, then
they would even be more glorified because people would proclaim that a
mere boy of Navadvipa defeated a champion scholar who was famous
throughout India. It so happened that Nimai Pandit met Kesava Kasmiri
while strolling on the banks of the Ganges. The Lord requested him to
compose a Sanskrit verse in praise of the Ganges, and the pandit within a
short time composed a hundred $lokas, reciting the verses like a storm and
showing the strength of his vast learning. Nimai Pandit at once memorized


--- Page 12 ---
Introduction 13
all the slokas without an error. He quoted the sixty-fourth sloka and
pointed out certain rhetorical and literary irregularities. He particularly
questioned the pandit’s use of the words bhavani-bhartuh. He pointed out
that the use of these two words was redundant. Bhavani means the wife of
Siva, and who else can be her bhartd, or husband. He also pointed out
several other discrepancies, and the Kashmir papdit was struck with won-
der. He was astonished that a mere student of grammar could point out
theliterary mistakes of an erudite scholar. Although this matter was ended
prior to any public meeting, the news spread like wildfire all over Nava-
dvipa. But finally Ke$ava Kaémirl was ordered in a dream by Sarasvati, the
goddess of learning, to submit to the Lord, and thus the Kashmir papdit
became a follower of the Lord.

The Lord was then married with great pomp and gaiety, and at this time
He began to preach the congregational chanting of the holy name of the
Lord at Navadvipa. Some of the brahmapas became envious of His populari-
ty, and they put many hindrances on His path. They were so jealous that
they finally took the matter before the Muslim magistrate at Navadvipa.
Bengal was then governed by Pathans, and the governor of the province
was Nawab Hussain Shah. The Muslim magistrate of Navadvipa took up
the complaints of the brahmapas seriously, and at first he warned the
followers of Nimai Pandit not to chant loudly the name of Hari. But Lord
Caitanya asked His followers to disobey the orders of the Kazi, and they
went on with their sankirtana (chanting) party as usual. The magistrate
then sent constables who interrupted a sankirtana and broke some of the
mydangas (drums). When Nimiai Pandit heard of this incidence He organized
a party for civil disobedience. He is the pioneer of the civil disobedience
movement in India for the right cause. He organized a procession of
100,000 men with thousands of mrdaiigas and karatalas (hand cymbals),
and this procession passed over the roads of Navadvipa in defiance of the
Kazi who issued the order. Finally the procession reached the house of the
Kazi, who went upstairs out of fear of the masses. The great crowds
assembled at the Kazi’s house displayed a violent temper, but the Lord
asked them to be peaceful. At this time the Kazi came down and tried to
pacify the Lord by addressing Him as his nephew. He pointed out that
Nilambara Cakravarti referred to him as an uncle, and consequently,
Srimati Sacidevi, the mother of Nimai Pandit, was his sister. He asked the
Lord whether his sister’s son could be angry at His maternal uncle, and the
Lord replied that since the Kazi was His maternal uncle he should receive
his nephew well at his home. In this way the issue was mitigated, and the
two learned scholars began a long discussion on the Koran and Hindu


--- Page 13 ---
14 Srimad-Bhagavatam

sastras. The Lord raised the question of cow killing, and the Kazi properly
answered Him by referring to the Koran. In turn the Kazi also questioned
the Lord about cow sacrifice in the Vedas, and the Lord replied that such
sacrifice as mentioned in the Vedas is not actually cow killing. In that
sacrifice an old bull or cow was sacrificed for the sake of receiving a fresh
younger life by the power of Vedic mantras. But in the Kali-yuga such
cow sacrifices are forbidden because there are no qualified brahmanas
capable of conducting such a sacrifice. In fact, in Kali-yuga all ydjiias
(sacrifices) are forbidden because they are useless attempts by foolish men.
In Kali-yuga only the sankirtana yajiia is recommended for all practical
purposes. Speaking in this way, the Lord finally convinced the Kazi, who
became the Lord’s follower. The Kazi thenceforth declared that no one
should hinder the sankirtana movement which was started by the Lord,
and the Kazi left this order in his will for the sake of progeny. The Kazi’s
tomb still exists in the area of Navadvipa, and Hindu pilgrims go there to
show their respects. The Kazi’s descendants are residents, and they never
objected to sankirtana, even during the Hindu Muslim riot days.

This incidence shows clearly that the Lord was not a so-called timid
Vaisnava. A Vaispava is a fearless devotee of the Lord, and for the right
cause he can take any step suitable for the purpose. Arjuna was also a
Vaisnava devotee of Lord Krsna, and he fought valiantly for the satisfaction
of the Lord. Similarly, Vajrangaji, or Hanuman, was also a devotee of Lord
Rama, and he gave lessons to the nondevotee party of Ravana. The princi-
ples of Vaisnavism are to satisfy the Lord by all means. A Vaisnava is by
nature a nonviolent, peaceful living being, and he has all the good qualities
of God, but when the nondevotee blasphemes the Lord or His devotee, the
Vaisnava never tolerates such impudency.

After this incidence the Lord began to preach and propagate His
Bhagavata-dharma, or sankirtana movement, more vigorously, and whoever
stood against this propagation of the yuga-dharma, or duty of the age, was
properly punished by various types of chastisement. Two brahmana gentle-
men named Chapala and Gopala, who also happened to be maternal uncles
of the Lord, were inflicted with leprosy by way of chastisement, and later,
when they were repentant, they were accepted by the Lord. In the course
of His preaching work, He used to send daily all His followers, including
Srila Nityananda Prabhu and Thakur Haridasa, two chief whips of His
party, from door to door to preach the Srimad-Bhigavatam. All of
Navadvipa was surcharged with His sankirtana movement, and His head-
quarters were situated at the house of Srivasa Thakur and Sri Advaita
Prabhu, two of His chief householder disciples. These two learned heads

Introduction 15
of the brahmapa community were the most ardent supporters of Lord
Caitanya’s movement. Sri Advaita Prabhu was the chief cause for the
advent of the Lord. When Advaita Prabhu saw that the total human
society was full of materialistic activities and devoid of devotional service,
which alone could save mankind from the threefold miseries of material
existence, he, out of his causeless compassion for the age-worn human
society, prayed fervently for the incarnation of the Lord and continually
worshiped the Lord with the water of the Ganges and the leaves of the holy
tulasi tree. As far as preaching work in the saikirtana movement was
concerned, everyone was expected to do his daily share according to the
order of the Lord.

Once Nityananda Prabhu and Srila Haridasa Thakur were walking down
a main road, and on the way they saw a roaring crowd assembled. Upon
inquiring from passers-by, they understood that two brothers, named Jagai
and Madhai, were creating a public disturbance in a drunken state. They
also heard that these two brothers were born in a respectable brahmana
family, but because of low association they had turned into debauchees of
the worst type. They were not only drunkards but also meat-eaters,
woman-hunters, decoits and sinners of all description. Srila Nityananda
Prabhu heard all of these stories and decided that these two fallen souls
must be the first to be delivered. If they were delivered from their sinful
life, then the good name of Lord Caitanya would be even still more
glorified. Thinking in this way, Nityananda Prabhu and Haridasa pushed
their way through the crowd and asked the two brothers to chant the
holy name of Lord Hari. The drunken brothers became enraged upon
this request and attacked Nityananda Prabhu with filthy language. Both
brothers chased them a considerable distance. In the evening the report of
the preaching work was submitted to the Lord, and He was glad to learn
that Nityananda and Haridasa had attempted to deliver such a stupid pair
of fellows.

The next day Nityananda Prabhu went to see the brothers, and as soon
as He approached them one of them threw a piece of earthen pot at Him.
This struck Him on the forehead, and immediately blood began to flow.
But Nityananda Prabhu was so kind that instead of protesting this heinous
act, He said, “It does not matter that you have thrown this stone at Me. I
still request you to chant the holy name of Lord Hari.”

One of the brothers, Jagai, was astonished to see this behavior of
Nityananda Prabhu, and he at once fell down at His feet and asked Him to
pardon his sinful brother. When Madhai again attempted to hurt Nityananda
Prabhu, Jagai stopped him and implored him to fall down at His feet.

16 Srimad-Bhagavatam

In the meantime the news of Nityananda’s injury reached the Lord,
who at once hurried to the spot in a fiery and angry mood. The Lord
immediately invoked His Sudarsana-cakra (the Lord’s ultimate weapon,
shaped like a wheel) to kill the sinners, but Nityananda Prabhu reminded
Him of His mission. The mission of the Lord was to deliver the hopelessly
fallen souls of Kali-yuga, and the brothers Jagai and Madhai were typical
examples of these fallen souls. Ninety percent of the population of this
age resembles these brothers, despite high birth and mundane respecta-
bility. According to the verdict of the revealed scriptures, the total
population of the world in this age will be of the lowest Sidra quality, or
even lower. It should be noted that Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu never
acknowledged the stereotyped caste system by birthright; rather, He
strictly followed the verdict of the $astras in the matter of one’s svaripa,
or real identity.

When the Lord was invoking His Sudarsana-cakra and Srila Nityananda
Prabhu was imploring Him to forgive the two brothers, both the brothers
fell down at the lotus feet of the Lord and begged His pardon for their
gross behavior. The Lord was also asked by Nityananda Prabhu to accept
these repenting souls, and the Lord agreed to accept them on one
condition, that they henceforward completely give up all their sinful
activities and habits of debauchery. Both the brothers agreed and promised
to give up all their sinful habits, and the kind Lord accepted them and did
not again refer to their past misdeeds.

This is the specific kindness of Lord Caitanya. In this age no one can
say that he is free from sin. It is impossible for anyone to say this. But
Lord Caitanya accepts all kinds of sinful persons on the one condition
that they promise not to indulge in sinful habits after being spiritually
initiated by the bona fide spiritual master.

There are a number of instructive points to be observed in this inci-
dence of the two brothers. In this Kali-yuga practically all people are of
the quality of Jagai and Madhai. If they want to be relieved from the
reactions of their misdeeds, they must take shelter of Lord Caitanya
Mahaprabhu and after spiritual initiation thus refrain from those things
which are prohibited in the sastras. The prohibitory rules are dealt with in
the Lord’s teachings to Srila Riipa Gosvami.

During His householder life, the Lord did not display many of the
miracles which are generally expected from such personalities, but He did
once perform a wonderful miracle in the house of Srinivasa Thakur while
sankirtana was in full swing. He asked the devotees what they wanted to
eat, and when He was informed that they wanted to eat mangos, He asked


--- Page 16 ---
Introduction 17
for a seed of a mango, although this fruit was out of season. When the seed
was brought to Him He sowed it in the yard of Srinivasa, and at once a
creeper began to grow out of the seed. Within no time this creeper became
a full-grown mango tree heavy with more ripened fruits than the devotees
could eat. The tree remained in Srinivasa’s yard, and from then on the
devotees used to take as many mangos from the tree as they wanted.

The Lord had a very high estimation of the affections of the damsels of
Vrajabhiimi (Vrndavana) for Krsna, and in appreciation of their unalloyed
service to the Lord, once Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu chanted the holy names
of the gopis (cowherd girls) instead of the names of the Lord. At this time
some of His students, who were also disciples, came to see Him, and when
they saw that the Lord was chanting the names of the gopis, they were
astonished. Out of sheer foolishness they asked the Lord why He was
chanting the names of the gopis and advised Him to chant the name of
Krsna. The Lord, who was in ecstasy, was thus disturbed by these foolish
students. He chastised them and chased them away. The students were
almost the same age as the Lord, and thus they wrongly thought of the
Lord as one of their peers. They held a meeting and resolved that they
would attack the Lord if He dared to punish them again in such a manner.
This incidence provoked some malicious talks about the Lord on the part
of the general public.

When the Lord became aware of this, He began to consider the various
types of men which are found in society. He noted that especially the
students, professors, fruitive workers, yogis, nondevotees, and different
types of atheists were all opposed to the devotional service of the Lord.
“My mission is to deliver all the fallen souls of this age,” He thought, “but
if they commit offenses against Me, thinking Me to be an ordinary man,
they will not benefit. If they are to begin their life of spiritual realization,
they must some way or another offer obeisances unto Me.” Thus the Lord
decided to accept the renounced order of life (sannydsa) because people in
general were inclined to offer respects to a sannydsi.

Five hundred years ago the condition of society was not as degraded as
it is today. At that time people would show respects to a sannydsi, and the
sannydsi was rigid in following the rules and regulations of the renounced
order of life. Sr Caitanya Mahaprabhu was not very much in favor of the
renounced order of life in this age of Kali, but that was only for the reason
that very few sannydsis in this age are able to observe the rules and regula-
tions of sannydsa life. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu decided to accept the
order and become an ideal sannyasi so that the general populace would
show Him respect. One is duty-bound to show respect to a sannyasi, for a


--- Page 17 ---
18 Srimad-Bhagavatam
sannyasi is considered to be the master of all varpas and asramas.

While He was contemplating accepting the sannydsa order, it so hap-
pened that Kesava Bharati, a sannydsi of the Mayavadi school and resident
of Katwa (in Bengal), visited Navadvipa and was invited to dine with the
Lord. When Kesava Bharati came to His house, the Lord asked him to
award Him the sannydsa order of life. This was a matter of formality. A
sannyasa order is to be accepted from another sannyasi. Although the
Lord was independent in all respects, still, to keep up the formalities of
the sastras, He accepted the sannydsa order from Kesava Bharati, although
Kesava Bharati was not in the Vaisnava sampradaya (school).

After consulting with Kesava Bharati, the Lord left Navadvipa for
Katwa to formally accept the sannydsa order of life. He was accom-
panied by Srila Nityananda Prabhu, Candragekhara Acarya, and Mukunda
Datta. These three assisted Him in the details of the ceremony. The inci-
dence of the Lord's accepting the sannydsa order is very elaborately de-
scribed in the Caitanya-bhagavata by Srila Vrndavana-dasa Thakur.

Thus at the end of His twenty-fourth year the Lord accepted the sannyasa
order of lifein the month of Magha. After accepting this order He became a
full-fledged preacher of the Bhagavata-dharma. Although He was doing the
same preaching work in His householder life, when He experienced some
obstacles to His preaching, He sacrificed even the comfort of His home life
for the sake of the fallen souls. In His householder life His chief assistants
were Srila Advaita Prabhu and Srila Srivasa Thakur, but after He accepted
the sannyasa order His chief assistants became Srila Nityananda Prabhu,
who was deputed to preach specifically in Bengal, and the six Gosvamis
(Rapa Gosvami, Sanatana Gosvami, Jiva Gosvami, Gopila Bhatta Gosvami,
Raghunatha Dasa Gosvami, and Raghunatha Bhatta Gosvami), headed by
Srila Ripa and Sanatana, who were deputed to go to Vrndavana to
excavate the present places of pilgrimage. The present city of Vrndavana
and the importance of Vrajabhiimi were thus disclosed by the will of Lord
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.

The Lord, after accepting the sannydsa order, at once wanted to start
for Vrndavana. For three continual days He travelled in the Radha Desha
(places where the Ganges does not flow). He was in full ecstasy over the
idea of going to Vrndavana. However, Srila Nityananda Prabhu diverted
His path and brought Him instead to the house of Advaita Prabhu in
Santipura. The Lord stayed at Sri Advaita Prabhu’s house for a few days,
and knowing well that the Lord was leaving His hearth and home for
good, Sri Advaita Prabhu sent his men to Navadvipa to bring mother Saci
to have a last meeting with her son. Some unscrupulous people say that


--- Page 18 ---
Introduction 19
Lord Caitanya met His wife also after taking sannydsa and offered her His
wooden slipper for worship, but the authentic sources give no information
about such a meeting. His mother met Him at the house of Advaita
Prabhu, and when she saw her son in sannyasa, she lamented. By way of
compromise, she requested her son to make His headquarters in Purl so
that she would easily be able to get information about Him. The Lord
granted this last desire of His beloved mother. After this incidence the
Lord started for Purl, leaving all the residents of Navadvipa in an ocean of
lamentation over His separation.

The Lord visited many important places on the way to Puri. He visited
the temple of Gopinathaji, who had stolen condensed milk for His devotee
Srila Madhavendra Puri. Since then Deity Gopinathajl is well known as
Ksira-cora Gopinatha. The Lord relished this story with great pleasure.
The propensity of stealing is there even in the absolute consciousness, but
because this propensity is exhibited by the Absolute, it loses its perverted
nature and thus becomes worshipable even by Lord Caitanya on the basis
of the absolute consideration that the Lord and His stealing propensity are
one and identical. This interesting story of Gopinathaji is vividly explained
in the Caitanya-caritamrta by Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami.

After visiting the temple of Ksira-cora Gopinatha of Remuna at Balasore
in Orissa, the Lord proceeded towards Puri and on the way visited the
temple of Saksi Gopila, who appeared as a witness in the matter of two
brahmana devotees’ family quarrel. The Lord heard the story of Saksi
Gopila with great pleasure because He wanted to impress upon the atheists
that the worshipable Deities in the temples approved by the great acaryas
are not idols, as alleged by men with a poor fund of knowledge. The Deity
in the temple is the arcd incarnation of the Personality of Godhead, and
thus the Deity is identical with the Lord in all respects. He responds to the
proportion of the devotee’s affection for Him. In the story of Saksi
Gopila, in which there was a family misunderstanding by two devotees of
the Lord, the Lord, in order to mitigate the turmoil as well as to show
specific favor to His servitors, travelled from Vrndavana to Vidyanagar, a
village in Orissa, in the form of His ৫70৫ incarnation. From there the Deity
was brought to Cuttack, and thus the temple of Saksi Gopala is even today
visited by thousands of pilgrims on the way to Jagannatha Puri. The Lord
stayed overnight there and began to proceed toward Puri. On the way, His
sannyasa rod was broken by Nityananda Prabhu. The Lord became ap-
parently angry with him about this and went alone to Puri, leaving His
companions behind.

At Puri, when He entered the temple of Jagannatha, He became at once


--- Page 19 ---
20 Srimad-Bhagavatam

saturated with transcendental ecstasy and fell down on the floor of the
temple unconscious. The custodians of the temple could not understand
the transcendental feats of the Lord, but there was a great learned pandit
named Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya, who was present, and he could under-
stand that the Lord’s losing His consciousness upon entering the Jagannatha
temple was not an ordinary thing. Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya, who was the
chief appointed pandit in the court of the King of Orissa, Maharaja
Prataparudra, was attracted by the youthful luster of Lord Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu and could understand that such a transcendental trance was
only rarely exhibited and only then by the topmost devotees who are
already on the transcendental plane in complete forgetfulness of material
existence. Only a liberated soul could show such a transcendental feat, and
the Bhattacarya, who was vastly learned, could understand this in the light
of the transcendental literature with which he was familiar. He therefore
asked the custodians of the temple not to disturb the unknown sannyasi.
He asked them to take the Lord to his home so He could be further
observed in His unconscious state. The Lord was at once carried to the
home of Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya, who at that time had sufficient power
of authority due to his being the sabha pandit or the state dean of faculty
in Sanskrit literatures. The learned pandit wanted to scrutinizingly test the
transcendental feats of Lord Caitanya because often unscrupulous devotees
imitate physical feats in order to flaunt transcendental achievements just
to attract innocent people and take advantage of them. A learned scholar
like the Bhattacarya can detect such imposters, and when he finds them
out he at once rejects them.

In the case of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu, the Bhattacarya tested all the
symptoms in the light of the $astras. He tested as a scientist, rot as a foolish
sentimentalist. He observed the movement of the stomach, the beating of
the heart and the breathing of the nostrils. He also felt the pulse of the
Lord and saw that all His bodily activities were in complete suspension.
When he put a small cotton swab before the nostrils, he found that there
was a slight breathing as the fine fibers of cotton moved slightly. Thus he
came to know that the Lord’s unconscious trance was genuine, and he began
to treat Him in the prescribed fashion. But Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu could
only be treated in a special way. He would only respond to the resounding
of the holy names of the Lord by His devotees. This special treatment was
unknown to Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya because the Lord was still unknown
to him. When he saw Him for the first time in the temple, he simply took
Him to be one of many pilgrims.


--- Page 20 ---
Introduction 21

In the meantime the companions of the Lord, who reached the temple
a little after Him, heard of the Lord’s transcendental feats and of His being
carried away by the Bhattacarya. The pilgrims at the temple were still
gossiping about the incident. But by chance, one of these pilgrims had met
Gopinatha Acarya, who was known to Gadadhara Pandit, and from him it
was learned that the Lord was lying in an unconscious state at the resi-
dence of Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya, who happened to be the brother-in-law
of Gopinatha Acarya. All the members of the party were introduced by
Gadadhara Pandit to Gopinatha Aciarya, who took them all to the house
of Bhattacarya where the Lord was lying unconscious in a spiritual trance.
All the members then chanted loudly the holy name of the Lord Hari as
usual, and the Lord regained His consciousness. After this, Bhattacarya
received all the members of the party, including Lord Nityananda Prabhu,
and asked them to become his guests of honor. The party, including the
Lord, went for a bath in the sea, and the Bhattacarya arranged for their
residence and meals at the house of Kasi Misra. Gopinatha Acarya, his
brother-in-law, also assisted. There were some friendly talks about the
Lord’s divinity between the two brothersinlaw, and in this argument
Gopinatha Acarya, who knew the Lord before, now tried to establish the
Lord as the Personality of Godhead, and the Bhattacarya tried to establish
Him as one of the great devotees. Both of them argued from the angle of
vision of authentic $astras and not on the strength of sentimental vox
populi. The incarnations of God are determined by authentic $astras and
not by popular votes of foolish fanatics. Lord Caitanya was an incarnation
of God in fact, but foolish fanatics have proclaimed so many so-called
incarnations of God in this age without referring to authentic scriptures.
But Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya or Gopinatha Acarya did not indulge in
such foolish sentimentalism; on the contrary, both of them tried to estab-
lish or reject His divinity on the strength of authentic sastras.

Later it was disclosed that Bhattacarya also came from the Navadvipa
area, and it was understood from him that Nilambara Cakravarti, the
maternal grandfather of Lord Caitanya, happened to be a class fellow of
the father of Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya. In that sense, the young sannydasi
Lord Caitanya evoked paternal affection from Bhattacarya. Bhattacarya
was the professor of many sannydsis in the order of the Sankaracirya
sampraddya, and he himself also belonged to that cult. As such, the
Bhattacarya desired that the young sannyasi Lord Caitanya also hear from
him about the teachings of Vedanta.

Those who are followers of the Sarikara cult are generally known as


--- Page 21 ---
22 Srimad-Bhagavatam

Vedantists. This does not, however, mean that Vedanta is a monopoly
study of the Sankara sampradaya. Vedanta is studied by all the bona fide
sampradayas, but they have their own interpretations. But those in the
Saikara sampraddya are generally known to be ignorant of the knowledge
of the Vedantist Vaisnavas. For this reason the Bhaktivedanta title was
first offered to the author by the Vaispavas.

The Lord agreed to take lessons from Bhattacarya on the Vedanta, and
they sat together in the temple of Lord Jagannatha. The Bhattacarya went
on speaking continually for seven days, and the Lord heard him with all
attention and did not interrupt. The Lord’s silence raised some doubts in
Bhattacarya’s heart, and he asked the Lord how it was that He did not ask
anything or comment on his explanations of Vedanta.

The Lord posed Himself before the Bhattacarya as a foolish student and
pretended that He heard the Vedanta from him because the Bhattacarya
felt that this was the duty of a sannyasi. But the Lord did not agree with
his lectures. By this the Lord indicated that the so-called Vedantists
amongst the Sarkara sampraddya, or any other sampradaya, who do not
follow the instructions of Srila Vyasadeva are mechanical students of the
Vedanta. They are not fully aware of that great knowledge. The explana-
tion of the Vedanta-siitra is given by the author himself in the text of
Srimad-Bhagavatam. One who has no knowledge of the Bhagavatam will
hardly be able to know what the Vedanta says.

The Bhattacarya, being a vastly learned man, could follow the Lord’s sar-
caslic remarks on the popular Vedantist. He therefore asked Him why He
did not ask about any point which He could not follow. The Bhattacarya
could understand the purpose of His dead silence for the days He heard
him. This shows clearly that the Lord had something else in mind; thus the
Bhattacarya requested Him to disclose His mind.

Upon this, the Lord spoke as follows: “My dear sir, I can understand
the meaning of the siitras like janmady asya yatah,” ‘$astra-yonitvat,” and
‘athato brahma-jijiiasa’ of the Vedanta-siitra, but when you explain them
in your own way it becomes difficult for Me to follow them. The purpose
of the siitras is already explained in them, but your explanations are
covering them with something else. You do not purposely take the direct
meaning of the siitras but indirectly give your own interpretations.”

The Lord thus attacked all Vedantists who interpret the Vedanta-sitre
fashionably, according to their limited power of thinking, to serve their
own purpose. Such indirect interpretations of the authentic literatures like
the Vedinta are hereby condemned by the Lord.


--- Page 22 ---
Introduction 23

The Lord continued: “Srila Vyasadeva has summarized the direct
meanings of the mantras in the Upanisads in the Vedanta-sitra. Unfor-
tunately you do not take their direct meaning. Indirectly you interpret
them in a different way.

“The authority of the Vedas is unchallengeable and stands without any
question of doubt. And whatever is stated in the Vedas must be accepted
completely, otherwise one challenges the authority of the Vedas.

“The conchshell and cowdung are bone and stool of two living beings.
But because they have been recommended by the Vedas as pure, people
accept them as such because of the authority of the Vedas.”

The idea is that one cannot set his imperfect reason above the authority
of the Vedas. The orders of the Vedas must be obeyed as they stand
without any mundane reasoning. The so-called followers of the Vedic
injunction make their own interpretations of the Vedic injunctions, and
thus they establish different parties and sects of the Vedic religion. Lord
Buddha directly denied the authority of the Vedas, and he established his
own religion. Only for this reason the Buddhist religion was not accepted
by the strict followers of the Vedas. But those who are so-called followers
of the Vedas are more harmful than the Buddhists. The Buddhists have the
courage to deny the Vedas directly, but the so-called followers of the
Vedas have no courage to deny the Vedas, although indirectly they disobey
all the injunctions of the Vedas. Lord Caitanya condemned this.

The example of the conchshell and that of the cowdung given by the
Lord are very much appropriate in this connection. If one argues that since
cowdung is pure, the stool of a learned brahmana is still more pure, his
argument will not be accepted. Cowdung is accepted, and the stool of a
highly posted brahmana 15 rejected. The Lord continued:

“The Vedic injunctions are self-authorized, and if some mundane
creature adjusts the interpretations of the Vedas, he defies their authority.
It isfoolish to think of oneself as more intelligent than Srila Vyasadeva. He
has already expressed himself in his siitras, and there is no need of help
from personalities of lesser importance. His work, the Vedanta-siitra, is as
dazzling as the midday sun, and when someone tries to give his own
interpretations on the self-effulgent sunlike Vedanta-siitra, he attempts to
cover this sun with the cloud of his imagination.

“The purpose of the Vedas and Puranas are one and the same. They
ascertain the Absolute Truth, which is greater than everything else. The
Absolute Truth is ultimately realized as the Absolute Personality of
Godhead with absolute controlling power. As such, the Absolute Person-


--- Page 23 ---
24 Srimad-Bhagavatam

ality of Godhead must be completely full of opulence, strength, fame,
beauty, knowledge and renunciation. Yet the transcendental Personality
of Godhead is astonishingly ascertained as impersonal.

“The impersonal description of the Absolute Truth in the Vedas is given
to nullify the mundane conception of the absolute whole. Personal features
of the Lord are completely different from all kinds of mundane features.
The living entities are all individual persons, and they are all parts and
parcels of the supreme whole. If the parts and parcels are individual
persons, the source of their emanation must not be impersonal. He is the
Supreme Person amongst all the relative persons.

“The Vedas inform us that from Him [Brahman] everything emanates,
and on Him everything rests. And after annihilation, everything merges in
Him only. Therefore, He is the ultimate dative, causative and accommo-
dating cause of all causes. And all these causes cannot be attributed to an
impersonal object.

“The Vedas inform us that He alone became many, and when He so
desires He glances over material nature. Before He glanced over material
nature there was no material cosmic creation. Therefore, His glance is not
material. Material mind or senses were unborn when the Lord glanced over
material nature. Thus evidence in the Vedas proves that beyond a doubt
the Lord has transcendental eyes and a transcendental mind. They are not
material. His impersonality therefore is a negation of His materiality, but
not a denial of His transcendental personality.

“Brahman ultimately refers to the Personality of Godhead. Impersonal
Brahman realization is just the negative conception of the mundane crea-
tions. Paramatma is the localized aspect of Brahman within all kinds of
material bodies. Ultimately the Supreme Brahman realization is the reali-
zation of the Personality of Godhead according to all evidence of the
revealed scriptures. He is the ultimate source of Visnu tattvas.

“The Puranas are also supplementary to the Vedas. The Vedic mantras
are too difficult for an ordinary man. Women, siidras and the so-called
twice-born higher castes are unable to penetrate into the sense of the
Vedas. And thus the Itihasa or the Mahabharata as well as the Puranas are
made easy to explain the truths of the Vedas. In his prayers before the boy
Sri Krsna, Brahma said that there is no limit to the fortune of the residents
of Vrajabhiimi headed by Sri Nanda Maharaja and Yasodamayi because
the eternal Absolute Truth has become their intimate relative.

“The Vedic mantra maintains that the Absolute Truth has no legs and
no hands and yet goes faster than all and accepts everything that is


--- Page 24 ---
Introduction 25
offered to Him in devotion. The latter statements definitely suggest the
personal features of the Lord, although His hands and legs are distinguished
from mundane hands and legs or other senses.

“Brahman is, therefore, never impersonal, but when such mantras are

i indirectly interpreted, it is wrongly thought that the Absolute Truth is
impersonal. The Absolute Truth Personality of Godhead is full of all
opulences, and therefore He has a transcendental form of full existence,
knowledge and bliss. How then can one establish that the Absolute Truth
is impersonal?

“Brahman, being full of opulences, is understood to have manifold
energies, and all these energies are classified under three headings under
the authority of Visnu Purana (6.7.60), which says that the transcendental
energies of Lord Visnu are primarily three. His spiritual energy, as well as
the energy of the living entities, are classified as superior energy, whereas
the material energy is an inferior one which is sprouted out of ignorance.

“The energy of the living entities is technically called ksetrajiia energy.
This ksetrajiia-sakti, although equal in quality with the Lord, becomes
overpowered by material energy out of ignorance and thus suffers all sorts
of material miseries. In other words, the living entities are located in the
marginal energy between the superior spiritual and inferior material
energy, and in proportion to the living being’s contact with either the
material or spiritual energies, the living entity is situated in proportionately
higher and lower levels of existence.

“The Lord is beyond the inferior and marginal energies as above men-
tioned, and His spiritual energy is manifested in three different phases: as
eternal existence, eternal bliss and eternal knowledge. As far as eternal
existence is concerned, it is conducted by the sandhini potency ; similarly,
bliss and knowledge are conducted by the hladhini and sariwit potencies
respectively. As the supreme energetic Lord, He is the supreme controller
of the spiritual, marginal and material energies. And all these different
types of energies are connected with the Lord in eternal devotional service.

“The Supreme Personality of Godhead is thus enjoying in His transcen-
dental eternal form. Is it not astounding that one dares to call the Supreme
Lord nonenergetic? The Lord is the controller of all energies, and the
living entities are parts and parcels of one of the energies. Therefore there
is a gulf of difference between the Lord and the living entities. How then
can one say that the Lord and the living entities are one and the same? In
the Bhagavad-gitd also the living entities are described as belonging to the
superior energy of the Lord. According to the principles of intimate


--- Page 25 ---
26 Srimad-Bhagavatam

correlation between the energy and the energetic, both of them are non-
different also. Therefore, the Lord and the living entities are nondifferent
as the energy and the energetic.

“Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and ego are all inferior
energies of the Lord, but the living entities are different from all as superior
energy. This is the version of Bhagavad-gita.

“The transcendental form of the Lord is eternally existent and full of
transcendental bliss. How then can such a form be a product of the ma-
terial mode of goodness? Anyone, therefore, who does not believe in the
form of the Lord is certainly a faithless demon and as such is untouchable,
a not to be seen persona non grata fit to be punished by the Plutonic king.

“The Buddhists are called atheists because they have no respect for the
Vedas, but those who defy the Vedic conclusions, as above mentioned,
under the pretense of being followers of the Vedas, are verily more
dangerous than the Buddhists.

“Sri Vyasadeva very kindly compiled the Vedic knowledge in his
Vedanta-sitra, but if one hears the commentation of the Mayavadi school
(as represented by the Sarikara sampraddya) certainly he will be misled on
the path of spiritual realization.

“The theory of emanations is the beginning subject of the Vedanta-
stra. All the cosmic manifestations are emanations from the Absolute
Personality of Godhead by His inconceivable different energies. The
example of the touchstone is applicable to the theory of emanation. The
touchstone can convert an unlimited quantity of iron into gold, and still
the touchstone remains as it is. Similarly, the Supreme Lord can produce
all manifested worlds by His inconceivable energies, and yet He is full
and unchanged. He is pirna [complete], and although an unlimited
number of piirnas emanate from Him, He is still parpa.

“The theory of illusion of the Mayavada school is advocated on the
ground that the theory of emanation will cause a transformation of the
Absolute Truth. If that is the case, Vyasadeva is wrong. To avoid this, they
have skillfully brought in the theory of illusion. But the world or the
cosmic creation is not false, as maintained by the Mayavada school. Tt
simply has no permanent existence. A nonpermanent thing cannot be
called false altogether. But the conception that the material body is the
self is certainly wrong.

“Pranava [om] or the omkara in the Vedas is the primeval hymn. This
transcendental sound is identical with the form of the Lord. All the Vedic
hymns are based on this prapava omkara. Tattvamasi is but a side word in
the Vedic literatures, and therefore this word cannot be the primeval hymn


--- Page 26 ---
Introduction bird
of the Vedas. Sripada Safikaricarya has given more stress on the side word
tattvamasi than on the primeval principle omkara.”

The Lord thus spoke on the Vedanta-siitra and defied all the propaganda
of the Mayavada school* The Bhattacarya tried to defend himself and his
Mayavada school by jugglery of logic and grammar, but the Lord was able
to defeat him by His forceful arguments. He affirmed that we are all
related with the Personality of Godhead eternally and that devotional
service is our eternal function to exchange the dealings of our relations.
And the result of such exchanges is to attain prema or love of Godhead.
When love of Godhead is attained, love for all other beings automatically
follows because the Lord is the sum total of all living beings.

The Lord said that but for these three items—namely, eternal relation
with God, exchange of dealings with Him and the attainment of love for
Him—all that is instructed in the Vedas is superfluous and concocted.

The Lord further added that the Mayavada philosophy taught by
Sripada Sarikaracarya is an imaginary explanation of the Vedas, but it had
to be taught by him (Sarikaracirya) because he was ordered to teachit by
the Personality of Godhead. In the Padma Purana it is stated that the
Personality of Godhead ordered His Lordship Siva to deviate the human
race from Him (the Personality of Godhead.) The Personality of Godhead
was to be so covered so that people would be encouraged to generate more
and more population. His Lordship Siva said to Devi: “In the Kali-yuga,
I shall preach the Mayavada philosophy, which is nothing but clouded
Buddhism, in the garb of a brahmapa.”

After hearing all these speeches of the Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, the
Bhattacarya was struck with wonder and awe and regarded Him in dead
silence. The Lord then encouraged him with assurance that there was no
cause to wonder. “I say that devotional service unto the Personality of
Godhead is the highest goal of human life.” He then quoted a sloka from
the Bhagavatam and assured him that even the liberated souls who are
absorbed in the spirit and spiritual realization also take to the devotional
service of the Lord Hari because the Personality of Godhead has such
transcendental qualities that He attracts the heart of the liberated soul too.

Then the Bhatticarya desired to listen to the explanation of the
“@tmarama” sloka from the Bhagavatam (1.7.10). The Lord first of all
asked Bhattacarya to explain it, and after that He would explain it. The
Bhattacarya then scholarly explained the sloka with special reference to

*In our Teachings of Lord Caitanya we have more elaborately explained all these
philosophical intricacies. Srimad-Bhagavatam clarifies them all.


--- Page 27 ---
28 Srimad-Bhagavatam
logic. He explained the sloka in nine different ways chiefly based on logic
because he was the most renowned scholar of logic of the time.

The Lord, after hearing the Bhattacarya, thanked him for the scholarly
presentation of the sloka, and then, at the request of the Bhattacarya, the
Lord explained the 81010 in sixty-four different ways without touching the
nine explanations given by the Bhattacarya.

Thus after hearing the explanation of the atmarama sloka from the
Lord, the Bhattacarya was convinced that such a scholarly presentation is
impossible for an earthly creature.* Before this Sri Gopinatha Acarya tried
to convince him of the divinity of the Lord, but at that time he could not
so accept Him. But the Bhattacarya was astounded by the Lord’s exposi-
tion of the Vedanta-sitra and explanations of the atmarama sloka, and
thus he began to think that he had committed a great offense at the lotus
feet of the Lord by not recognizing Him to be Krsna Himself. He then
surrendered unto Him, repenting for his past dealings with Him, and the
Lord was kind enough to accept the Bhattacarya. Out of His causeless
mercy, the Lord manifested before him first as four-handed Narayana and
then again as two-handed Lord Krsna with a flute in His hand. .

The Bhattacarya at once fell down at the lotus feet of the Lord and
composed many suitable §lokas in praise of the Lord by His grace. He
composed almost one hundred slokas in praise of the Lord. The Lord then
embraced him, and out of transcendental ecstasy the Bhattacarya lost
consciousness of the physical state of life. Tears, trembling, throbbing of
the heart, perspiration, emotional waves, dancing, singing, crying and all
the eight symptoms of trance were manifested in the body of the
Bhattacarya. Sri Gopinatha Acirya became very glad and astonished by
this marvellous conversion of his brother-in-law by the grace of the Lord.

Out of the hundred celebrated slokas composed by the Bhattacarya in
praise of the Lord, the following two are most important, and these two
slokas explain the mission of the Lord in gist. They are as follows.

1. Let me surrender unto the Personality of Godhead who has appeared
now as Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. He is the ocean of all mercy and
has come down to teach us material detachment, learning and devotional
service to Himself.

2. Since pure devotional service of the Lord has been lost in the oblivion
of time, the Lord has appeared to renovate the principles, and therefore 1
offer my obeisances unto His lotus feet.

*The complete text of the explanation given by the Lord will form a booklet itself,
and therefore we have presented it in a chapter in our Teachings of Lord Caitanya.

Introduction 29

The Lord explained the word mukti to be equivalent to the word Visnu,
or the Personality of Godhead. To attain mukti or liberation from the
bondage of material existence is to attain to the service of the Lord.

The Lord then proceeded towards South India for some time and
converted everyone He met on the way to become devotees of Lord Sri
Krsna. Such devotees also converted many others to the cult of devotional
service or to the Bhagavata-dharma of the Lord, and thus He reached the
bank of the Godavari, where He met Srila Ramananda Raya, the Gover-
nor of Madras on behalf of Maharaja Prataparudra, the King of Orissa.
His talks with Ramananda Raya are very important for higher realization
of transcendental knowledge, and the conversation itself forms a small
booklet. We shall, however, give herewith a summary of the conversation.

Sri Ramananda Raya was a self-realized soul, although outwardly he
belonged to a caste lower than the brihmana in social status. He was not
in" the renounced order of life, and besides that he was a high government
servant in the State. Still Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu accepted him as a
liberated soul on the strength of the high order of his realization of
transcendental knowledge. Similarly, the Lord accepted Srila Haridasa
Thakur, a veteran devotee of the Lord coming from a Mohammedan family.
And there are many other great devotees of the Lord who came from
different communities, sects and castes. The Lord's only criterion was the
standard of devotional service of the particular person. He was not con-
cerned with the outward dress of a man; He was concerned only with the
inner soul and its activities. Therefore the whole missionary activities of
the Lord are to be understood to be on the spiritual plane, and as such the
cult of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu or the cult of Bhagavata-dharma has
nothing to do with mundane affairs, sociology, politics, economic develop-
ment or any such sphere of life. Srimad-Bhagavatam is the purely transcen-
dental urge of the soul.

When He met ওা Rimananda Riya on the bank of the Godavari, the
varpdsrama-dharma followed by the Hindus was mentioned by the Lord.
Srila Ramananda Raya said that by following the principles of varnasrama-
dharma, the system of four castes and four orders of human life, everyone
could realize transcendence. In the opinion of the Lord, the system of
varpa$rama-dharma is superficial only, and it has very little to do with the
highest realization of spiritual values. The highest perfection of life is to
get detached from the material attachment and proportionately realize the
transcendental loving service of the Lord. The Personality of Godhead
recognizes a living being who is progressing in that line. Devotional service
is, therefore, the culmination of the culture of all knowledge. When Sri
Krsna the Supreme Personality of Godhead appeared for the deliverance


--- Page 29 ---
30 Srimad-Bhagavatam

of all fallen souls, He advised the deliverance of all living entities as follows.
The Supreme Absolute Personality of Godhead, from whom all living
entities have emanated, must be worshiped by all their respective engage-
ments, because everything that we see is also the expansion of His energy.
That is the way of real perfection, and it is approved by all bona fide
dcaryas past and present. The system of varpasrama is more or less based
on moral and ethical principles. There is very little realization of the
transcendence as such, and Lord Sr Caitanya Mahaprabhu rejected it as
superficial and asked Ramananda Raya to go further into the matter.

Sri Ramananda Riya then suggested renunciation of fruitive actions
unto the Lord. The Bhagavad-gita advises in this connection: “Whatever
you do, whatever you eat and whatever you give, as well as whatever you
perform in penance, offer to Me alone.” This dedication on the part of the
worker suggests that the Personality of Godhead is a step higher than the
impersonal conception of the varpdsrama system, but still the relation of
the living being and the Lord is not distinct in that way. The Lord
therefore rejected this proposition and asked Ramiananda Raya to go
further.

Raya then suggested renunciation of the varparama-dharma and accep-
tance of devotional service. The Lord did not approve of this suggestion
also for the reason that all of a sudden one should not renounce his
position, for that may not bring in the desired result.

It was further suggested by Raya that attainment of spiritual realization
freed from the material conception of life is the topmost achievement for
a living being. The Lord rejected this suggestion also because on the plea
of such spiritual realization much havoc has been wrought by unscrupulous
persons; therefore all of a sudden this is not possible. The Raya then
suggested sincere association of self-realized souls and hearing submissively
the transcendental message of the pastimes of the Personality of Godhead.
This suggestion was welcomed by the Lord. This suggestion was made
following in the footsteps of Brahmaji, who said that the Personality of
Godhead is known as gjita or the one who cannot be conquered or
approached by anyone. But such gjita also becomes jita (conquered) by
one method, which is very simple and easy. The simple method is that one
has to give up the arrogant attitude of declaring oneself to be God Himself.
One must be very meek and submissive and try to live peacefully by
lending the ear to the speeches of the transcendentally self-realized soul
who speaks on the message of Bhdgavata-dharma or the religion of glori-
fying the Supreme Lord and His devotees. To glorify a great man is a
natural instinct for living beings, but they have not learned to glorify the


--- Page 30 ---
Introduction 31
Lord. Perfection of life is attained simply by glorifying the Lord in
association with a self-realized devotee of the Lord.* The self-realized
devotee is he who surrenders unto the Lord fully and who does not have
attachment for material prosperity. Material prosperity and sense enjoy-
ment and their advancement are all activities of ignorance in human
society. Peace and friendship are impossible for a society detached from
the association of God and His devotees. It is imperative, therefore, that
one should sincerely seek the association of pure devotees and hear them
patiently and submissively from any position of life. The position of a
person in the higher or lower status of life does not hamper one in the
path of self-realization. The only thing one has to do is to hear from a self-
realized soul with a routine program. The teacher may also deliver lectures
from the Vedic literatures, following in the footsteps of the bygone
dcaryas who realized the Absolute Truth. Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu
recommended this simple method of self-realization generally known as
Bhagavata-dharma. Srimad-Bhdgavatam is the perfect = for this purpose.

Above these topics discussed by the Lord and Sri Ramananda Raya,
there were still more elevated spiritual talks between the two great
personalities, and we purposely withhold those topics for the present
because one has to come to the spiritual plane before further talks with
Raminanda Riya can be heard. We have presented further talks of Srila
Raminanda Raya with the Lord in another book (Teachings of Lord
Caitanya).

At the conclusion of this meeting, Sri Rimananda Raya was advised by
the Lord to retire from service and come to Puri so that they could live
together and relish a transcendental relationship. Some time later, Sri
Ramananda Raya retired from the Government service and took a pension
from the King. He returned to his residence in Purl, where he was one of
the most confidential devotees of the Lord. There was another gentleman
at Puri of the name Sikha Maiti, who was also a confidante like Ramananda
Raya. The Lord used to hold confidential talks on spiritual values with
three or four companions at Puri,and He passed eighteen years in that way
in spiritual trance. His talks were recorded by His private secretary Sri
Damodara Gosvami, one of the four most intimate devotees.

The Lord extensively travelled all over the southern part of India. The
great saint of Maharastra, known as saint Tukaram, was also initiated by
the Lord. Saint Tukaram, after initiation by the Lord, overflooded the
whole of the Maharastra Province with the 50780780720 movement, and the

*The International Society for Krishna Consciousness is formed for this purpose.


--- Page 31 ---
32 Srimad-Bhagavatam
transcendental flow is still rolling on in the southwestern part of the great
Indian peninsula.

The Lord excavated from South India two very important old literatures,
namely the Brahma-sarhita* and Krsna-karnamrta, and these two valuable
books are authorized studies for the person in the devotional line. The
Lord then returned to Puri after His South Indian tour.

On His return to Puri, all the anxious devotees of the Lord got back
their life, and the Lord remained there with continued pastimes of His
transcendental realizations. The most important incidence during that time
was His granting audience to King Prataparudra. King Prataparudra was
a great devotee of the Lord, and he considered himself to be one of the ser-
vants of the Lord entrusted with sweeping the temple. This submissive at-
titude of the King was very much appreciated by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.
The King requested both Bhattacarya and Raya to arrange his meeting
with the Lord. When, however, the Lord was petitioned by His two stal-
wart devotees, He flatly refused to grant the request, even though it was
put forward by personal associates like Ramananda Raya and Sarvabhauma
Bhattacarya. The Lord maintained that it is dangerous for a sannydsi to be
in intimate touch with worldly money conscious men and with women.
The Lord was an ideal sannydsi. No woman could approach the Lord even
to offer respects. Women’s seats were accommodated far away from the
Lord. As an ideal teacher and dcarya, He was very strict in the routine work
of a sannyasi. Apart from being a divine incarnation, the Lord was an ideal
character as a human being. His behavior with other persons was also above
suspicion. In His dealing as dcarya, He was harder than the thunderbolt
and softer than the rose. One of His associates, Junior Haridasa, committed
a great mistake by lustfully glancing at a young woman, and the Lord as
Supersoul could detect this just in the mind of Junior Haridasa. He was at
once banished from His association and was never accepted again, even
though He was implored to excuse Haridasa for the mistake. Junior
Haridasa afterwards committed suicide due to being disassociated from the
company of the Lord, and the news of suicide was duly related to the
Lord. Even at that time the Lord was not forgetful of the offense, and He
said that Haridasa had rightly met with the proper punishment.

On the principles of the renounced order of life and discipline, the Lord
knew no compromise, and therefore even though He knew that the King
was a great devotee, He refused to see the King only because the King was
a dollar and cent man. By this example the Lord wanted to emphasize the
proper behavior for a transcendentalist. A transcendentalist has nothing
*Summary of Srimad-Bhagavatam.


--- Page 32 ---
Introduction 33
to do with women and money. He must always refrain from such intimate
relations. The King was, however, favored by the Lord by the expert
arrangement of the devotees. This means that the beloved devotee of the
Lord can favor a neophyte more liberally than the Lord. Pure devotees,
therefore, never commit an offense at the feet of another pure devotee.
An offense at the lotus feet of the Lord is sometimes excused by the
merciful Lord, but an offense at the feet of a devotee is very dangerous
for one who actually wants to make progress in devotional service.

As long as the Lord remained at Purl, thousands of His devotees used to
০০100 see Him during the Ratha-yatra car festival of Lord Jagannatha.
And during the car festival, the washing of the Gundica temple under the
direct supervision of the Lord was an important function. The Lord’s
congregational sankirtana movement at Purl was a unique exhibition for
the mass of people. That is the way to turn the mass mind towards spiritual
realization. The Lord inaugurated this system of mass sankirtana, and
leaders of all countries can take advantage of this spiritual movement in
order to keep the mass of people in a pure state of peace and friendship
with one another. This is now the demand of the present human society
all over the world.

After some time the Lord again started on his tour towards Northern
India, and He decided to visit Vrndavana and its neighboring places. He
passed through the jungles of Jharikhanda (Madhya Bharat), and all the
wild animals also joined His sanikirtana movement. The wild tigers, ele-
phants, bears and deer all together accompanied the Lord, and the Lord
accompanied them in 50716070710. By this He proved that by the propaga-
tion of the sankirtana movement (congregational chanting and glorifying
the name of the Lord) even the wild animals can live in peace and friend-
ship, and what to speak of men who are supposed to be civilized. No man
in the world will refuse to join the 50716070710 movement. Nor is the Lord’s
saftkirtana movement restricted to any caste, creed, color or species. Here
is direct evidence of His great mission: He allowed even the wild animals to
partake in His great movement.

On His way back from Vrndavana He first came to Prayag, where He met
Riipa Gosvami along with his younger brother Anupama. Then He came
down to Benares. For two months, He instructed Sri Sanatana Gosvami in
the transcendental science. The instruction to Sanatana Gosvami is in itself
a long narration, and full presentation of the instruction will not be
possible here. The main ideas are given as follows.

Sanatana Gosvami (formerly known as Dabir Khas) was in the cabinet
service of the Bengal Government under the regime of Nawab Husain Shah.
He decided to join with the Lord and thus retired from the service. On His


--- Page 33 ---
34 Srimad-Bhagavatam

way back from Vrndavana, when He reached Varanasi, the Lord became
the guest of Sri Tapana Misra and Candrasekhara, assisted by a Maharastra
brihmapa. At that time Varanasi was headed by a great sannydsi of the
Mayavada school named Sripada Prakasananda Sarasvati. When the Lord
was at Varanasi, the people in general became more attracted to Lord
Caitanya Mahaprabhu on account of His mass sankirtana movement.
Wherever He visited, especially the Visvanatha temple, thousands of pil-
grims would follow Him. Some were attracted by His bodily features, and
others were attracted by His melodious songs glorifying the Lord.

The Mayavadi sannydsis designate themselves as Narayana. Varanasi is
still overflooded with many Mayavadi sannydsis. Some people who saw the
Lord in His saitkirtana party considered Him to be actually Narayana, and
this report reached the camp of the great sannydsi Prakasananda.

In India there is always a kind of spiritual rivalry between the Mayavada
and Bhagavata schools, and thus when the news of the Lord reached
Prakasananda he knew that the Lord was a Vaisnava sannydsi, and there-
fore he minimized the value of the Lord before those who brought him the
news. He deprecated the activities of the Lord because of His preaching
the saikirtana movement, which was in his opinion nothing but religious
sentiment. Prakasananda was a profound student of the Vedanta, and he
advised his followers to give attention to the Vedanta and not to indulge
in sankirtana.

One devotee brahmana, who became a devotee of the Lord, did not like
the criticism of Prakasananda, and he went to the Lord to express his
regrets. He told the Lord that when he uttered the Lord’s name before the
sannydsi Prakasananda, the latter strongly criticized Him, although he
heard him uttering several times the name Caitanya. The brahmana was
astonished to see that the sannyasi Prakasananda could not vibrate the
sound Krsna even once, although he uttered the name Caitanya several
times.

The Lord smilingly explained to the devotee brahmana why the
Mayavadi cannot utter the holy name of Krsna. “The Mayavadis are of-
fenders at the lotus feet of Krsna, although they utter always Brahman.
Atma, or Caitanya, etc. And because they are offenders at the lotus feet of
Krsna, they are actually unable to utter the holy name of Krsna. The name
Krsna and the Personality of Godhead Krsna are identical. There is no
difference in the absolute realm between the name, form or person of the
Absolute Truth because in the absolute realm everything is transcendental
bliss. There is no difference between the body and the soul for the Person-
ality of Godhead, Krsna. Thus He is different from the living entity who
is always different from his outward body. Because of Krsna's transcen-


--- Page 34 ---
Introduction 35
dental position, it is very difficult for a layman to actually know the
Personality of Godhead, Krsna, His holy name and fame, etc. His name,
fame, form and pastimes all are one and the same transcendental identity,
and they are not knowable by the exercise of the material senses.

“The transcendental relationship of the pastimes of the Lord is the
source of still more bliss than one can experience by realization of Brahman
or by becoming one with the Supreme. Had it not been so, then those who
are already situated in the transcendental bliss of Brahman would not have
been attracted by the transcendental bliss of the pastimes of the Lord.”

After this, a great meeting was arranged by the devotees of the Lord in
which all the sannydsis were invited, including the Lord and Prakasananda
Sarasvatl. In this meeting both the scholars (the Lord and Prakadananda)
had a long discourse on the spiritual values of the 50711170710 movement,
and a summary is given below.

The great Mayavadi sannyasi Prakasananda inquired from the Lord as to
the reason for His preferring the sankirtana movement to the study of the
Vedanta-siitra. He said that it is the duty of a sannydsi to read the Vedanta-
5070. What caused Him to indulge in sarikirtana?

After this inquiry, the Lord submissively replied: “I have taken to the
saitkirtana movement instead of the study of Vedanta because I am a great
fool.” The Lord thus represented Himself as one of the numberless fools
of this age who are absolutely incapable of studying the Vedanta philoso-
phy. The fools’ indulgence in the study of Vedanta has caused so much
havoc in society. The Lord thus continued: “And because I am a great
fool, My spiritual master forbade Me to play with Vedanta philosophy. He
said that it isbetter that I chant the holy name of the Lord, for that would
deliver Me from material bondage.

“In this age of Kali there is no other religion but the glorification of the
Lord by utterance of His holy name, and that is the injunction of all the
revealed scriptures. And My spiritual master has taught Me one sloka
(from the Brhan-Naradiya Purana) which is:

harer nama harer nama harer namaiva kevalam
kalau nasty eva nasty eva nasty eva gatir anyatha.

“So on the order of my spiritual master, I chant the holy name of Hari,
and I am now mad after this holy name. Whenever I utter the holy name I
forget Myself completely, and sometimes I laugh, cry and dance like a
madman. I thought that I had actually gone mad by this process of
chanting, and therefore I asked My spiritual master about it. He informed
Me that this was the real effect of chanting the holy name, which


--- Page 35 ---
36 Srimad-Bhagavatam

produces a transcendental emotion that is a rare manifestation. It is the
sign of love of God, which is the ultimate end of life. Love of God is
transcendental to liberation [mukti], and thus it is called the fifth stage
of spiritual realization, above the stage of liberation. By chanting the holy
name of Krsna one attains the stage of love of God, and it was good that
fortunately 1 was favored with the blessing.”

On hearing this statement from the Lord, the Mayavadi sannydsi asked
the Lord what was the harm in studying the Vedanta along with chanting
the holy name. Prakasananda Sarasvati knew well that the Lord was
formerly known as Nimai Pandit, a very learned scholar of Navadvipa, and
His posing as a great fool was certainly to some purpose. Hearing this
inquiry by the sannyast, the Lord smiled and said, “My dear sir, if you do
not mind, I will answer your inquiry.”

All the sannyasis there were very much pleased with the Lord for His
honest dealings, and they unanimously replied that they would not be
offended by whatever He replied. The Lord then spoke as follows:

“Vedanta-siitra is comprised of transcendental words or sounds uttered
by the transcendental Personality of Godhead. As such, in the Vedanta
there cannot be any human deficiencies like mistake, illusion cheating or
inefficiency. The message of the Upanisads is expressed in the Vedanta-
siitra, and what is said there directly is certainly glorified. Whatever inter-
pretations have been given by Sarkaracarya have no direct bearing on the
siitra, and therefore such commentation spoils everything.

“The word Brahman indicates the greatest of all, which is full with
transcendental opulences, superior to all. Brahman is ultimately the Per-
sonality of Godhead, and He is covered by indirect interpretations and
established as impersonal. Everything that is in the spiritual world is full
of transcendental bliss, including the form, body, place and paraphernalia
of the Lord. All are eternally cognizant and blissful. It is not the fault of
the Acarya Sarikara that he has so interpreted Vedanta, but if someone
accepts it, then certainly he is doomed. Anyone who accepts the tran-
scendental body of the Personality of Godhead as something mundane
certainly commits the greatest blasphemy.”

The Lord thus spoke to the sannydsi almost in the same way that He
spoke to the Bhattacarya of Puri, and by forceful arguments He nullified
the Mayavada interpretations of the Vedanta-sitra. All the sannydsis
there claimed that the Lord was the personified Vedas and the Personality
of Godhead. All the sannyasis were converted to the cult of bhakti, and
all of them accepted the holy name of the Lord Sri Krsna, and they dined
together with the Lord in the midst of them. After this conversion of the


--- Page 36 ---
Introduction 37
sannydsis, the popularity of the Lord increased at Varanasi, and thousands
of people assembled to see the Lord in person. The Lord thus established
the primary importance of Srimad-Bhagavata-dharma, and He defeated all
other systems of spiritual realization. Since then everyone at Varanasi was
overwhelmed with the transcendental sankirtana movement.

While the Lord was camping at Varanasi, Sanatana Gosvami also arrived
after retiring from office. He was formerly one of the state ministers in the
government of Bengal, then under the regime of Nawab Hussain Shah. He
had some difficulty in getting relief from the state service, for the Nawab
was reluctant to let him leave. Nonetheless he came to Varanasi, and the
Lord taught him the principles of devotional service. He taught him about
the constitutional position of the living being, the cause of his bondage
under material conditions, his eternal relation with the Personality of
Godhead, the transcendental position of the Supreme Personality of God-
head, His expansions in different plenary portions of incarnations, His
control of different parts of the universe, the nature of His transcendental
abode, devotional activities, their different stages of development and the
rules and regulations for achieving the gradual stages of spiritual perfection,
the symptoms of different incarnations in different ages and how to
detect them with reference to the context of revealed scriptures.

The Lord's teachings to Sanatana Gosvami form a big chapter in the
text of Sri Caitanya-caritamrta, and to explain the whole teachings in
minute details will require a volume in itself. These are treated in detail
in our book Teachings of Lord Caitanya.

At Mathura, the Lord visited all the important places; then He reached
Vrndavana. Lord Caitanya appeared in the family of a high caste brah-
mana, and over and above that as sannyasi He was the preceptor for all the
varpas and asramas. But He used to accept meals from all classes of
Vaisnavas. At Mathura the Sanodhia brahmanas are considered to be in
the lower status of society, but the Lord accepted meals in their families
also because His host happened to be a disciple of the Madhavendra Puri
family.

At Vrndavana the Lord took bath in twenty-four important bathing
places and ghats. He travelled to all the twelve important vanas (forests).
In these forests all the cows and birds welcomed Him, as if He were their
very old friend. The Lord also began to embrace all the trees of those
forests, and by doing so He felt the symptoms of transcendetnal ecstasy.
Sometimes He fell unconscious, but He was made to regain consciousness
by the chanting of the holy name of Krsna. The transcendental symptoms
that were visible on the body of the Lord during His travel within the


--- Page 37 ---
38 Srimad-Bhagavatam
forest of Vrndavana were all unique and inexplicable, and we have just
given a synopsis only.

Some of the important places that were visited by the Lord in Vrndavana
were Kamyavana, Adiévara, Pabansarovara, Khadirvana, Sesasayi,
Khelatirtha, Bhandirvana, Bhadravana, Srivana, Lauhavana, Mahavana,
Gokula, Kaliyahrada, Dvadasaditya, Kesitirtha, etc. When He saw the place
where the risa dance took place, He at once fell down in trance. As long as
He remained at Vrndavana, He made His headquarters at Akrur Ghat.

From Vrndavana His personal servitor Krsnadasa Vipra induced Him
to go back to Prayag to take bath during the Magha Mela. The Lord acceded
10 this proposal, and they started for Prayag. On the way they were met
with some Pathans, amongst whom there was a learned Moulana. The Lord
had some talks with the Moulana and his companions, and the Lord
convinced the Moulana that in the Koran also there are descriptions of
Bhagavata-dharma and Krsna. All the Pathans were converted to His cult
of devotional service.

When He returned to Prayag, Srila Ripa Gosvami and his youngest
brother met Him near Bindu-madhava Temple. This time the Lord was
welcomed by the people of Prayag more respectfully. Vallabha Bhatta, who
resided on the other bank of Prayag in the village of Arail, was to receive
Him at his place, but while going there the Lord jumped in the River
Yamuna. With great difficulty He was picked up in an unconscious state.
Finally He visited the headquarters of Vallabha Bhatta. This Vallabha
Bhatta was one of His chief admirers, but later on he inaugurated his own
party of the Vallabha sampradaya.

On the bank of the Dasasvamedha Ghat at Prayag for ten days continu-
ally the Lord instructed Riipa Gosvami in the science of devotional service
of the Lord. He taught the Gosvami the divisions of the living creatures in
the 8,400,000 species of life. Then He taught him about the human
species. Out of them He discussed the followers of the Vedic principles,
out of them the fruitive workers, out of them the empiric philosophers,
and out of them the liberated souls. He said that there are only a few
who are actually pure devotees of Lord Sri Krsna.

Srila Riipa Gosvami was the younger brother of Sanatana Gosvami, and
when he retired from service he brought with him two boatfuls of gold
coins. This means that he brought with him some hundreds of thousands
of rupees accumulated by the labor of his service. And before leaving home
for Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu, he divided the wealth as follows: fifty
percent for the service of the Lord and His devotees, twenty-five percent
for relatives and twenty-five percent for his personal needs in case of
emergency . In that way he set an example for all householders.

Introduction 39

The Lord taught the Gosvami about devotional service, comparing it to
a creeper, and He advised him to protect the bhakti creeper most carefully
against the mad elephant offense against the pure devotees. In addition,
the creeper has to be protected from the desires of sense enjoyment,
monistic liberation and perfection of the hatha-yoga system. They are all
detrimental on the path of devotional service. Similarly, violence against
living beings, desire for worldly gain, worldly reception and worldly fame
are all detrimental to the progress of bhakti or Bhagavata-dharma.

Pure devotional service must be freed from all desires for sense gratifica-
tion, fruitive aspirations and culture of monistic knowledge. One must be
freed from all kinds of designations, and when one is thus converted into
transcendental purity, one can then serve the Lord by purified senses.

As long as there is the desire to enjoy sensually or to become one with
the Supreme or to possess the mystic powers, there is no question of
attaining the stage of pure devotional service.

Devotional service is conducted under two categories, namely primary
practice and spontaneous emotion. When one can rise up to the platform
of spontaneous emotion, he can make further progress by spiritual attach-
ment, feeling, love, and many higher stages of devotional life for which
there are no English words. We have tried to explain the science of
devotional service in our book The Nectar of Devotion based on the
authority of Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu by Srila Riipa Gosvami.

Transcendental devotional service has five stages of reciprocation.

1. The self-realization stage just after liberation from the material
bondage is called the santa or neutral stage.

2. After that, when there is development of transcendental knowledge
of the Lord’s internal opulences, the devotee engages himself in the dasya
stage.

3. By further development of the dasya stage, a respectful fraternity
with the Lord develops, and above that a feeling of friendship on equal
terms becomes manifest. Both these stages are called sakhya stage, or
devotional service in friendship.

4. Above this there is the stage of paternal affection toward the Lord
and this is called the vatsalya stage.

5. And above this stage there is the stage of conjugal love, and this
stage is called the highest stage of love of God, although there is no
difference in quality in any of the above stages. The last stage of conjugal
love of God is called the madhurya stage.

Thus He instructed Ripa Gosvami in devotional science and deputed him
to Vrndavana to excavate the lost sites of the transcendental pastimes of
the Lord. After this, the Lord returned to Varanasi and delivered the

sannyasis and instructed the elder brother of Riipa Gosvami. We have
already discussed this.

The Lord left only eight slokas of His instructions in writing, and they
are known as the Siksastakam. All other literatures of His divine cult were
extensively written by the Lord’s principal followers, the six Gosvamis of
Vrndavana, and their followers. The cult of Caitanya philosophy is richer
than any other, and it is admitted to be the living religion of the day with
the potency for spreading as Visva-dharma or universal religion. We are
glad that the matter has been taken up by some enthusiastic sages like
Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami Maharaja and his disciples. We shall
eagerly wait for the happy days of Bhdgavata-dharma or prema-dharma
inaugurated by the Lord & Caitanya Mahaprabhu.

The eight slokas completed by the Lord are:

dust accumulated for years and extinguishes the fire of conditional life, of
repeated birth and death. This 88110108118 movement is the prime benedic-
tion for humanity at large because it spreads the rays of the benediction
moon. It is the life of all transcendental knowledge. It increases the ocean
of transcendental bliss, and it enables us to fully taste the nectar for which
we are always anxious.

0 my Lord, Your holy name alone can render all benediction to living
beings, and thus You have hundreds and millions of names like Krsna and
Govinda. In these transcendental names You have invested all Your
transcendental energies. There are not even hard and fast rules for chanting
these names. O my Lord, out of kindness You enable us to easily approach
You by chanting Your holy names, but I am so unfortunate that I have no
attraction for them. 2

One should chant the holy name of the Lord in a humble state of mind,
thinking oneself lower than the straw in the street; one should be more
tolerant than a tree, devoid of all sense of false prestige and should be
ready to offer all respect to others. In such a state of mind one can chant
the holy name of the Lord constantly.

O almighty Lord, I have no desire to accumulate wealth, nor do I desire
beautiful women, nor do I want any number of followers. I only want
Your causeless devotional service birth after birth.

TRANSLATION

I offer my obeisances unto Lord Sri Krsna, son of Vasudeva, who is the
supreme all-pervading Personality of Godhead. I meditate upon Him, the
transcendent reality, who is the primeval cause of all causes, from whom
all manifested universes arise, in whom they dwell and by whom they are
destroyed. I meditate upon that eternally effulgent Lord who is directly
and indirectly conscious of all manifestations and yet is beyond them. It is
He only who first imparted Vedic knowledge unto the heart of Brahma,
the first created being. Through Him this world, like a mirage, appears real
even to great sages and demigods. Because of Him, the material universes,
created by the three modes of nature, appear to be factual, although they
are unreal. I meditate therefore upon Him, the Absolute Truth, who is
eternally existent in His transcendental abode, and who is forever free of
illusion.

PURPORT

Obeisances unto the Personality of Godhead, Vasudeva, directly indicate
Lord Sri Krsna, who is the divine son of Vasudeva and Devaki. This fact
will be more explicitly explained in the text of this work. Sri Vyasadeva
asserts herein that Sri Krsna is the original Personality of Godhead, and all
others are His direct or indirect plenary portions or portions of the
portion. Srila Jiva Gosvami has even more explicitly explained the subject
matter in his Krsna-sandarbha. And Brahma, the original living being, has
explained the subject of Sri Krsna substantially in his treatise named
Brahma-sarithita. In the Sama-veda Upanisad, it is also stated that Lord Sr
Krsna is the divine son of Devaki. Therefore, in this prayer, the first pro-
position holds that Lord Sri Krsna is the primeval Lord, and if any tran-
scendental nomenclature is to be understood as belonging to the Absolute
Personality of Godhead, it must be the name indicated by the word Krsna,
which means the all-attractive. In Bhagavad-gita, in many places, the Lord
asserts Himself to be the original Personality of Godhead, and this is
confirmed by Arjuna, and also by great sages like Narada, Vyasa, and many
others. In the Padma Purina, it is also stated that out of the innumerable
names of the Lord, the name of Krsna is the principal one. Vasudeva
indicates the plenary portion of the Personality of Godhead, and all the
different forms of the Lord, being identical with Vasudeva, are indicated
in this text. The name Vasudeva particularly indicates the divine son of
Vasudeva and Devaki. Sri Krsna is always meditated upon by the
paramaharisas who are the perfected ones among those in the renounced
order of life.

Vasudeva, or Lord Sri Krsna, is the cause of all causes. Everything that


--- Page 43 ---
Text 1] Questions by the Sages 45
exists emanates from the Lord. How this is so is explained in later chapters
of this work. This work is described by Mahaprabhu Sri Caitanya as the
spotless Purana because it contains the transcendental narration of the
Personality of Godhead Sri Krsna. The history of the Srimad-Bhagavatam
is also very glorious. It was compiled by da Vyasadeva after he had
attained maturity in transcendental knowledge. He wrote this under the
instructions of 0 Naradaji, his spiritual master. Vyasadeva compiled all
Vedic literatures containing the four divisions of the Vedas, the Vedanta-
50705 or the Brahma-siitras, the Puranas, the Mahabharata, and so on. But
nevertheless he was not satisfied. His dissatisfaction was observed by his
spiritual master, and thus Narada advised him to write on the transcen-
dental activities of Lord Sri Krsna. These transcendental activities are
described specifically in the Tenth Canto of this work. But, in order to
reach to the very substance, one must proceed gradually by developing
knowledge of the categories.

It is natural that a philosophical mind wants to know about the origin
of the creation. At night he sees the stars in the sky, and he naturally
speculates about their inhabitants. Such inquiries are natural for man
because man has a developed consciousness which is higher than that of
the animals. The author of Srimad-Bhdgavatam gives a direct answer to
such inquiries. He says that the Lord Sri Krsna is the origin of all creations.
He is not only the creator of the universe, but the destroyer as well. The
manifested cosmic nature is created at a certain period by the will of the
Lord. It is maintained for some time, and then it is annihilated by His will.
Therefore, the supreme will is behind all cosmic activities. Of course, there
are atheists of various catagories who do not believe in a creator, but that
is due to a poor fund of knowledge. The modern scientist, for example,
has created space satellites, and by some arrangement or other, these
satellites are thrown into outer space to fly for some time at the control
of the scientist who is far away. Similarly, all the universes with innumer-
able stars and planets are controlled by the intelligence of the Personality
of Godhead.

In Vedic literatures, it is said that the Absolute Truth, Personality of
Godhead, is the chief amongst all living personalities. All living beings
beginning from the first created being, Brahma, down to the smallest ant
are individual living beings. And above Brahma, there are even other living
beings with individual capacities, and the Personality of Godhead is also
a similar living being. And He is an individual as are the other living beings.
But the Supreme Lord or the supreme living being has the greatest
intelligence, and He possesses supermost inconceivable energies of all
different varieties. If a man’s brain can produce a space satellite, one can


--- Page 44 ---
46 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 1
very easily imagine how brains higher than man can produce similarly
wonderful things which are far superior. The reasonable person will easily
accept this argument, but there are stubborn atheists who would never
agree. Srila Vyasadeva, however, at once accepts the supreme intelligence
as the paramesvara. He offers his respectful obeisances unto the supreme
intelligence addressed as the para or the paramesvara or the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. And that paramesvara is इतं Krsna, as admitted
in Bhagavad-gita and other scriptures delivered by Sri Vyasadeva and
specifically in this Srimad-Bhagavatam. In Bhagavad-gita, the Lord says
that there is no other Para-tattva (summum bonum) than Himself. There-
fore, Sri Vyasadeva at once worships the Para-tattva, Sri Krsna, whose
transcendental activities are described in the Tenth Canto.

Unscrupulous persons go immediately to the Tenth Canto and especially
to the five chapters which describe the Lord’s rasa dance. This portion of
the Srimad-Bhdgavatam is the most confidential part of this great literature.
Unless one is thoroughly accomplished in the transcendental knowledge
of the Lord, one is sure to misunderstand the Lord’s worshipable transcen-
dental pastimes called rasa dance and His love affairs with the gopis. This
subject matter is highly spiritual, and only the liberated persons who have
gradually attained to the stage of paramahaisa can transcendentally relish
this rasa dance. Srila Vyasadeva therefore gives the reader the chance to
gradually develop spiritual realization before actually relishing the essence
of the pastimes of the Lord. Therefore, he purposely invokes a Gayatri
mantra, dhimahi. This Gayatri mantra is meant for spiritually advanced
people. When one is successful in chanting the Gayatri mantra, he can
enter into the transcendental position of the Lord. One must therefore
acquire brahminical qualities or be perfectly situated in the quality of
goodness in order to chant the Gayatri mantra successfully and then
attain to the stage of transcendentally realizing the Lord, His name, His
fame, His qualities and so on.

S$rimad-Bhagavatam is the narration of the svariipa of the Lord mani-
fested by His internal potency, and this potency is distinguished from
the external potency which has manifested the cosmic world, which is
within our experience. Srila Vyasadeva makes a clear distinction between
the two in this sloka. ও11 Vyasadeva says herein that the manifested internal
potency is real, whereas the external manifested energy in the form of
material existence is only temporary and illusory like the mirage in the
desert. In the desert mirage there is no actual water. There is only the
appearance of water. Real water is somewhere else. The manifested cosmic
creation appears as reality. But reality, of which this is but a shadow, is in


--- Page 45 ---
Text 1] Questions by the Sages 47
the spiritual world. Absolute Truth is in the spiritual sky, not the material
sky. In the material sky everything is relative truth. That is to say, one truth
depends on something else. This cosmic creation results from interaction
of the three modes of nature, and the temporary manifestations are so
created as to present an illusion of reality to the bewildered mind of the
conditioned soul, who appears in so many species of life, including the
higher demigods, like Brahma, Indra, Candra, and so on. In actuality, there
is no reality in the manifested world. There appears to be reality, however,
because of the true reality which exists in the spiritual world, where the
Personality of Godhead eternally exists with His transcendental parapher-
nalia.

The chief engineer of a complicated construction does not personally
take part in the construction, but he knows every nook and corner
because everything is done under his direction. He knows everything
about the construction, both directly and indirectly. Similarly, the Person-
ality of Godhead who is the supreme engineer of this cosmic creation
knows every nook and corner, although affairs are being carried out by
demigods. Beginning from Brahma down to the insignificant ant, no one is
independent in the material creation. The hand of the Lord is seen
everywhere. All material elements as well as all spiritual sparks emanate
from Him only. And whatever is created in this material world is but
the interaction ‘of two energies, the material and the spiritual, which
emanate from the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead, प्र Krsna.
A chemist can manufacture water in the chemical laboratory by mixing
hydrogen and oxygen. But, in reality, the living entity works in the
laboratory under the direction of the Supreme Lord. And the materials
with which he works are also supplied by the Lord. The Lord knows
everything directly and indirectly, and He is cognizant of all minute details,
and He is fully independent. He is compared with the mine of gold, and
the cosmic creations in so many different forms are compared with
objects made from the gold, such as gold rings, necklaces and so on. The
gold ring and the gold necklace are qualitatively one with the gold in the
mine, but quantitatively the gold in the mine is different. Therefore, the
Absolute Truth is simultaneously one and different. Nothing is absolutely
equal with the Absolute Truth, but at the same time, nothing is independent
of the Absolute Truth.

Conditioned souls beginning from Brahma, who engineers the entire
universe, down to the insignificant ant, are all creating, but none of them
are independent of the Supreme Lord. The materialist wrongly thinks that
there is no creator other than his own self. This is called mdya, or illusion.


--- Page 46 ---
48 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 1
Because of his poor fund of knowledge, the materialist cannot see beyond
the purview of his imperfect senses, and thus he thinks that matter
automatically takes its own shape without the aid of a superior intelligence.
This is refuted in this sloka by Srila Vyasadeva: “Since the complete
whole or the Absolute Truth is the source of everything, nothing can be
independent of the body of the Absolute Truth.” Whatever happens to
the body quickly becomes known to the embodied. Similarly, the creation
is the body of the absolute whole. Therefore, the Absolute knows every-
thing directly and indirectly that happens in the creation.

In the Sruti mantra, it is also stated that the absolute whole or Brahman
is the ultimate source of everything. Everything emanates from Him, and
everything is maintained by Him. And at the end, everything enters into
Him. That is the law of nature. In the Smrti mantra, the same is confirmed.
It is said that the source from which everything emanates at the beginning
of Brahma’s millennium, and the reservoir to which everything ultimately
enters, is the Absolute Truth or Brahman. Material scientists take it for
granted that the ultimate source of the planetary system is the sun, but
they are unable to explain the source of the sun. Herein, the ultimate
source is explained. According to the Vedic literatures, Brahma, who may
be compared to the sun, is not the ultimate creator. It is stated in this
loka that Brahma was taught Vedic knowledge by the Personality of
Godhead. One may argue that Brahma, being the original living being,
could not be inspired because there was no other being living at that time.
Herein it is stated that the Supreme Lord inspired the secondary creator,
Brahma, in order that Brahma could carry out his creative functions. So,
the supreme intelligence behind all creations is the Absolute Godhead, Si
Krsna. In Bhagavad-gitd, Lord Sri Krsna states that it is He only who super-
intends the creative energy, prakrti, which constitutes the totality of
matter. Therefore, Sri Vyasadeva does not worship Brahma, but the
Supreme Lord, who guides Brahma in his creative activities. In this 81010,
the particular words abhijiiah and svarat are significant. These two words
distinguish the Supreme Lord from all the other living entities. No other
living entity is either abhijiiah or svarat. Namely, no one is either fully
cognizant or fully independent. Even Brahma has to meditate upon the
Supreme Lord in order to create. Then what to speak of great scientists
like Einstein! The brains of such a scientist are certainly not the products
of any human being. Scientists cannot manufacture such a brain, and
what to speak of foolish atheists who defy the authority of the Lord?
Even Mayavadi impersonalists who flatter themselves that they can become
one with the Lord are neither abhijiiah nor svardt. Such impersonalists


--- Page 47 ---
Text 1] Questions by the Sages 49
undergo severe austerities to acquire knowledge to become one with the
Lord. But ultimately they become dependent on some rich disciple who
supplies them with money to build monasteries and temples. Atheists like
Ravana or Hiranyakadipu had to undergo severe penances before they
could flout the authority of the Lord. But ultimately, they were rendered
helpless and could not save themselves when the Lord appeared before
them as cruel death. This is also the case with the modern atheists who
also dare to flout the authority of the Lord. Such atheists will be dealt
with similarly, for history repeats itself. Whenever men neglect the
authority of the Lord, nature and her laws are there to penalize them. This
is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita in the well-known verse: yada yada hi
dharmasya glanih. “Whenever there is a decline of dharma and a rise of
adharma, O Arjuna, then I incarnate Myself.” (Bg. 4.7)

That the Supreme Lord is all-perfect is confirmed in all Sruti mantras.
It is said in the Sruti mantras that the all-perfect Lord threw a glance over
matter and thus created all living beings. The living beings are parts and
parcels of the Lord, and He impregnates the vast material creation with
seeds of spiritual sparks, and thus the creative energies are set in motion to
enact so many wonderful creations. An atheist may argue that God is no
more expert than a watchmaker, but of course God is greater because He
can create machines in duplicate male and female forms. The male and
female forms of different types of machineries go on producing innumer-
able similar machines without God’s further attention. If a man could
manufacture such a set of machines that could produce other machines
without his attention, then he could approach the intelligence of God.
But that is not possible, for each machine has to be handled individually.
Therefore, no one can create as well as God. Another name for God is
asmaurdha, which means that no one is equal to or greater than Him.
Param satyam, or the Supreme Truth, is He who has no equal or superior.
This is confirmed in the Sruti mantras. It is said that before the creation of
the material universe there existed the Lord only, who is master of every-
one. That Lord instructed Brahma in Vedic knowledge. That Lord has to
be obeyed in all respects. Anyone who wants to get rid of the material
entanglement must surrender unto Him. This is also confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita.

Unless one surrenders unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, it is
certain that he will be bewildered. When an intelligent man surrenders
unto the lotus feet of Krsna and knows completely that Krsna is the cause
of all causes, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gitd, then only can such an intelli-
gent man become a mahatma or great soul. But such a great soul is rarely


--- Page 48 ---
50 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 1
seen. Only the mahdatmds can understand that the Supreme Lord is the
primeval cause of all creations. He is parama or ultimate truth because all
other truths are relative to Him. He is omniscient. For Him, there is no
illusion.

Some Mayavadi scholars argue that Srimad-Bhdgavatam was not com-
piled by Sri Vyasadeva. And some of them suggest that this book is a
modern creation written by someone named Vopadeva. In order to refute
such meaningless arguments, Sri Sridhara Svami points out that there is
reference to the Bhdgavatam in many of the oldest Puranas. This first
sloka of the Bhagavatam begins with the Gayatri mantra. There is refer-
ence to this in the Matsya Purana, which is the oldest Purana. In that
Purana, it is said with reference to the Gayatri mantra in the Bhagavatam
that there are many narrations of spiritual instructions beginning with the
Gayatr1 mantra. And there is the history of Vrtrasura. Anyone who makes
a gift of this great work on a full moon day attains to the highest perfec-
tion of life by returning to Godhead. There is reference to the Bhagavatam
in other Puranas, also, where it is clearly stated that this work was finished
in twelve cantos which include 18,000 slokas. In the Padma Purana also
there is reference to the Bhagavatam in a conversation between Gautama
and Maharaja Ambarisa. The King was advised therein to read regularly
Srimad-Bhagavatam if he desired liberation from material bondage. Under
the circumstances, there is no doubt about the authority of the Bhdga-
vatam. Within the past 500 years, many erudite scholars and dacaryas like
Jiva Gosvami, Sanatana Gosvami, Visvanatha Cakravarti, Vallabhacirya,
and many other distinguished scholars even after the time of Lord Caitanya
made elaborate commentaries on the Bhagavatam. And the serious student
would do well to attempt to go through them to better relish the transcen-
dental messages.

Srila Viévanatha Cakravarti Thakur specifically deals with the original
and pure sex psychology (adi-rasa), devoid of all mundane inebriety. The
whole material creation is moving under the principle of sex life. In
modern civilization, sex life is the focal point for all activities. Wherever
one turns his face, he sees sex life predominant. Therefore, sex life is not
unreal. Its reality is experienced in the spiritual world. The material sex
life is but a perverted reflection of the original fact. The original fact is in
the Absolute Truth, and thus the Absolute Truth cannot be impersonal.
It is not possible to be impersonal and contain pure sex life. Consequently,
the impersonalist philosophers have given indirect impetus to the abomi-
nable mundane sex life because they have overstressed the impersonality of
the ultimate truth. Consequently, man without information of the actual


--- Page 49 ---
Text 2] Questions by the Sages 51
spiritual form of sex has accepted perverted material sex life as the all in
all. There is a distinction between sex life in the diseased material condi-
tion and spiritual sex life.

This Srimad-Bhdgavatam will gradually elevate the unbiased reader to
the highest perfectional stage of transcendence. It will enable him to tran-
scend the three modes of material activities: fruitive actions, speculative
philosophy, and worship of functional deities as inculcated in Vedic verses.

Completely rejecting all religious activities which are materially moti-
vated, this Bhagavata Purana propounds the highest truth, which is under-
standable by those devotees who are pure in heart. The highest truth is
reality distinguished from illusion for the welfare of all. Such truth uproots
the threefold miseries. This beautiful Bhagavatam, compiled by the great
sage Sri Vyasadeva, is sufficient in itself for God realization. As soon as one
attentively and submissively hears the message of Bhagavatam, he becomes
attached to the Supreme Lord.

Religion includes four primary subjects, namely pious activities, eco-
nomic development, satisfaction of the senses, and finally liberation from
material bondage. Irreligious life is a barbarous condition. Indeed, human
life begins when religion begins. Eating, sleeping, fearing, and mating are
the four principles of animal life. These are common both to animals and
to human beings. But religion is the extra function of the human being.
Without religion, human life is no better than animal life. Therefore, in
human societies there is some form of religion which aims at self-realization
and which makes reference to man’s eternal relationship with God.

In the lower stages of human civilization, there is always competition
to lord it over the material nature or, in other words, there is a continuous
rivalry to satisfy the senses. Driven by such consciousness, man turns to
religion. He thus performs pious activities or religious functions in order
to gain something material. But if such material gains are obtainable in
other ways, then so-called religion is neglected. This is the situation in
modern civilization. Man is thriving economically, so at present he is not
very interested in religion. Churches, mosques or temples are now practically
vacant. Men are more interested in factories, shops, and cinemas than in
religious places which were erected by their forefathers. This practically
proves that religion is performed for some economic gains. Economic
gains are needed for sense gratification. Often when one is baffled in the
pursuit of sense gratification, he takes to salvation and tries to become
one with the Supreme Lord. Consequently, all these states are simply
different types of sense gratification.

In the Vedas, the above mentioned four activities are prescribed in the
regulative way so that there will not be any undue competition for sense
gratification. But Srimad-Bhagavatam is transcendental to all these sense
gratificatory activities. It is purely transcendental literature which can be
understood only by the pure devotees of the Lord who are transcendental
to competitive sense gratification. In the material world there is keen
competition between animal and animal, man and man, community and
community, nation and nation. But the devotees of the Lord rise above
such competitions. They do not compete with the materialist because
they are on the path back to Godhead where life is eternal and blissful.
Such transcendentalists are nonenvious and pure in heart. In the material
world, everyone is envious of everyone else, and therefore there is
competition. But the transcendental devotees of the Lord are not only
free from material envy, but they are well-wishers to everyone, and they


--- Page 51 ---
Text 2] Questions by the Sages 53
strive to establish a competitionless society with God in the center. The
contemporary socialist’s conception of a competitionless society is artificial
because in the socialist state there is competition for the post of dictator.
From the point of view of the Vedas or from the point of view of common
human activities, sense gratification is the basis of material life. There are
three paths mentioned in the Vedas. One involves fruitive activities to
gain promotion to better planets. Another involves worshiping different
demigods for promotion to the planets of the demigods, and another
involves realizing the Absolute Truth and His impersonal feature and
becoming one with Him.

The impersonal aspect of the Absolute Truth is not the highest. Above
the impersonal feature is the Paramatma feature, and above this there is
the personal feature of the Absolute Truth or Bhagavan. Srimad-Bhagavatam
gives information about the Absolute Truth in His personal feature. It is
higher than impersonalist literatures and higher than the jiana-kanda
division of the Vedas. It is even higher than the karma-kanda division, and
even higher than the upasana-kapda division because it recommends the
worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Sri Krsna. In the
karma-kanda, there is competition to reach heavenly planets for better
sense gratification, and there is similar competition in the jiana-kanda and
the upasana-kanda. The Srimad-Bhagavatam is superior to all of these
because it aims at the Supreme Truth which is the substance or the root of
all categories. From Srimad-Bhagavatam one can come to know the sub-
stance as well as the categories. The substance is the Absolute Truth, the
Supreme Lord, and all emanations are relative forms of energy.

Nothing is apart from the substance, but at the same time the energies
are different from the substance. This conception is not contradictory.
Srimad-Bhagavatam explicitly promulgates this simultaneously one and
different philosophy of the Vedanta-siitra, which begins with the “jan-
mady asya” sitra.

This knowledge of the energy of the Lord being simultaneously one
and different from the Lord is an answer to the mental speculators’
attempt to establish the energy as the Absolute. When this knowledge is
factually understood, one sees the conceptions of monism and dualism to
be imperfect. Development of this transcendental consciousness grounded
in the conception of simultaneously one and different leads one immedi-
ately to the stage of freedom from the threefold miseries. The threefold
miseries are 1.) those miseries which arise from the mind and body, 2.)
those miseries inflicted by other living beings, and 3.) those miseries
arising from natural catastrophes over which one has no control. Srimad-


--- Page 52 ---
54 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 1
Bhagavatam begins with the surrender of the devotee unto the Absolute
Person. The devotee is fully aware that he is one with the Absolute and at
the same time in the eternal position of servant to the Absolute. In the
material conception, one falsely thinks himself the lord of all he surveys,
and therefore he is always troubled by the threefold miseries of life. But
as soon as one comes to know his real position as transcendental servant,
he at once becomes free from all miseries. As long as the living entity is
trying to master material nature, there is no possibility of his becoming
servant of the Supreme. Service to the Lord is rendered in pure conscious-
ness of one’s spiritual identity; by service one is immediately freed from
material encumbrances.

Over and above this, Simad-Bhdgavatam is a personal commentation
on the Vedanta-siitra by Sri Vyasadeva. It is written in the maturity of his
spiritual life through the mercy of Narada. Sti Vyasadeva is the authorized
incarnation of Narayana, the Personality of Godhead. Therefore, there is
no question as to his authority. He is the author of all other Vedic litera-
tures, yet he recommends the study of Srimad-Bhdgavatam above all others.
In other Puranas there are different methods set forth by which one can
worship the demigods. But in the Bhagavatam only the Supreme Lord is
mentioned. The Supreme Lord is the total body, and the demigods are the
different parts of that body. Consequently, by worshiping the Supreme
Lord, one does not need to worship the demigods. The Supreme Lord
becomes fixed in the heart of the devotee immediately. Lord Caitanya
Mahaprabhu has recommended the Srimad-Bhdgavatam as the spotless
Purina and distinguishes it from all other Puranas.

The proper method for receiving this transcendental message is to hear
it submissively. A challenging attitude cannot help one realize this transcen-
dental message. One particular word. is used herein for proper guidance.
This word is $usriisu. One must be anxious to hear this transcendental
message. The desire to sincerely hear is the first qualification.

Less fortunate persons are not at all interested in hearing this Srimad-
Bhagavatam. The process is simple, but the application is difficult.
Unfortunate people find enough time to hear idle, social, political conver-
sations, but when invited to attend a meeting of devotees to hear Srimad-
Bhagavatam they suddenly become reluctant. Sometimes professional
readers of the Bhagavatam immediately plunge into the confidential topics
of the pastime of the Supreme Lord, which they seemingly interpret as
sex literature. Srimad-Bhagavatam is meant to be heard from the beginning.
Those who are fit to assimilate this work are mentioned in this sloka:
“One becomes qualified to hear Srimad-Bhagavatam after many pious

deeds.” The intelligent person by thoughtful discretion can be assured by
the great sage Vyasadeva that he can realize the Supreme Personality
directly by hearing Srimad-Bhagavatam. Without undergoing the different
stages of realization set forth in the Vedas, one can be lifted immediately
to the position of paramaharisa simply by agreeing to receive this message.

Know, O thoughtful men, that Srimad-Bhagavatam is the mature fruit
of the tree of Vedic literatures. It emanated from the lips of Sri Sukadeva
Gosvami. Therefore this nectarean fruit is all the more relishable by
liberated souls.
PURPORT
In the two previous slokas it has been definitely proved that the Srimad-
Bhagavatam is the sublime literature which surpasses all other Vedic
scriptures due to its transcendental qualities. It is transcendental to all


--- Page 54 ---
56 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 1
mundane activities and mundane knowledge. In this sloka it is stated that
Srimad-Bhagavatam is not only a superior literature, but that it is the
ripened fruit of all Vedic literatures. In other words, it is the cream of all
Vedic knowledge. Considering all this, patient and submissive hearing is
definitely essential. With great respect and attention, one should receive
the message and lessons imparted by the Srimad-Bhagavatam.

The Vedas are compared to the desire tree because they contain all
things knowable by man. They deal with mundane necessities as well as
spiritual realization. The Vedas contain regulated principles of knowledge
covering social, political, religious, economic, military, medicinal, chemical,
physical and metaphysical subject matter and all that may be necessary to
keep the body and soul together. Above and beyond all this are specific
directions for spiritual realization. Regulated knowledge involves a gradual
raising of the living entity to the spiritual platform, and the highest spiritual
realization is to know that the Personality of Godhead is the reservoir of
all spiritual tastes or rasas.

Every living entity, beginning from Brahma, the first-born living being
within the material world, down to the insignificant ant, desires to relish
some sort of taste derived from sense perceptions. These sensual pleasures
are technically called rasas. Such rasas are of different varieties. In the
revealed scriptures the following twelve varieties of rasas are enumerated:
1) raudra (anger) 2) adbhuta (wonder) 3) $ragara (conjugal love) 4) hasya
(comedy) 5) ण्ण (chivalry) 6) dayd (mercy) 7) dasya (servitorship)
8) sakhya (fraternity) 9) bhayanaka (horror) 10) vibhatsa (shock) 11)
santa (neutrality) 12) vatsalya (parenthood).

The sum total of all these rasas is called affection or love. Primarily,
such signs of love are manifested in adoration, service, friendship, eternal
affection, and conjugal love. And when these five are absent, love is present
indirectly in anger, wonder, comedy, chivalry, fear, shock and so on. For
example, when a man is in love with a woman, the rasa is called conjugal
love. But when such love affairs are disturbed there may be wonder, anger,
shock, or even horror. Sometimes love affairs between two persons cul-
minate in ghastly murder scenes. Such rasas are displayed between man
and man and between animal and animal. There is no possibility of an
exchange of rasa between a man and an animal or between a man and any
other species of living beings within the material world. The rasas are
exchanged between members of the same species. But as far as the spirit
souls are concerned, they are one qualitatively with the Supreme Lord.
Therefore, the rasas were originally exchanged between the spiritual living
being and the spiritual whole, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The


--- Page 55 ---
Text 3] Questions by the Sages 57
spiritual exchange or rasa is fully exhibited in spiritual existence between
living beings and the Supreme Lord.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is therefore described in the
Sruti mantras, Vedic hymns, as “the fountainhead of all rasas.”” When one
associates with the Supreme Lord and exchanges one’s constitutional rasa
with the Lord, then the living being is actually happy.

These Sruti mantras indicate that every living being has its constitutional
position which is endowed with a particular type of rasa which is to be
exchanged with the Personality of Godhead. In the liberated condition
only, this primary rasa is experienced in full. In the material existence, the
rasa is experienced in the perverted form, which is temporary. And thus
the rasas of the material world are exhibited in the material form of raudra
(anger) and so on.

Therefore, one who attains full knowledge of these different rasas,
which are the basic principles of activities, can understand the false repre-
sentations of the original rasas which are reflected in the material world.
The learned scholar seeks to relish the real rasa in the spiritual form. In the
beginning he desires to become one with the Supreme. Thus, intelligent
transcendentalists cannot go beyond this conception of becoming one
with the spirit whole, without knowing of the different rasas.

In this $loka, it is definitely stated that spiritual rasa, which is relished
even in the liberated stage, can be experienced in the literature of the
Srimad-Bhagavatam due to its being the ripened fruit of all Vedic know-
ledge. By submissively hearing this transcendental literature, one can
attain the full pleasure of his heart’s desire. But, one must be very careful
to hear the message from the right source. Srimad-Bhdgavatam is exactly
received from the right source. It was brought by Narada Muni from the
spiritual world and given to his disciple Sri Vyasadeva. The latter in turn
delivered the message to his son Srila Sukadeva Gosvami, and Srila Sukadeva
Gosvami delivered the message to Maharaja Pariksit just seven days before
the King’s death. Srila Sukadeva Gosvami was a liberated soul from his
very birth. He was liberated even in the womb of his mother, and he did
not undergo any sort of spiritual training after his birth. At birth no one
is qualified, neither in the mundane ror the spiritual sense. But Sri
Sukadeva Gosvami, due to his being a perfectly liberated soul, did not have
to undergo an evolutionary process for spiritual realization. Yet despite
his being a completely liberated person situated in the transcendental
position above the three material modes, he was attracted to this transcen-
dental rasa of the Supreme Personality of Godhead who is adored by
liberated souls who sing Vedic hymns. The Supreme Lord’s pastimes are


--- Page 56 ---
58 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 1
more attractive to liberated souls than to mundane people. He is of
necessity not impersonal because it is only possible to carry on transcen-
dental rasa with a person.

In the Srimad-Bhdgavatam the transcendental pastimes of the Lord are
narrated, and the narration is systematically depicted by Srila Sukadeva
Gosvami. Thus the subject matter is appealing to all classes of persons,
including those who seek liberation and those who seek to become one
with the supreme whole.

In Sanskrit the parrot is also known as suka. When a ripened fruit is cut
by the red beaks of such birds, its sweet flavor is enhanced. The Vedic
fruit which is mature and ripe in knowledge is spoken through the lips of
Srila Sukadeva Gosvami, who is compared to the parrot not for his ability
to recite the Bhagavatam exactly as he heard it from his learned father,
but for his ability to present the work in a manner that would appeal to
all classes of men.

The subject matter is so presented through the lips of Srila Sukadeva
Gosvami that any sincere listener that hears submissively can at once
relish transcendental tastes which are distinct from the perverted tastes
of the material world. The ripened fruit is not dropped all of a sudden from
the highest planet of Krsnaloka. Rather, it has come down carefully
through the chain of disciplic succession without change or disturbance.
Foolish people who are not in the transcendental disciplic succession
commit great blunders by trying to understand the highest transcendental
rasa known as the rise dance without following in the footsteps of Suka-
deva Gosvami, who presents this fruit very carefully by stages of transcen-
dental realization. One should be intelligent to know the position of
Srimad-Bhdgavatam by considering personalities like Sukadeva Gosvami,
who deals with the subject so carefully. This process of disciplic succession
of the Bhagavata school suggests that in the future also Srimad-Bhagavatam
has to be understood from a person who is factually a representative of
Srila Sukadeva Gosvami. A professional man who makes a business out of
reciting the Bhagavatam illegally is certainly not a representative of Suka-
deva Gosvami. Such a man’s business is only to earn his livelihood. There-
fore one should refrain from hearing the lectures of such professional men.
Such men usually go to the most confidential part of the literature without
undergoing the gradual process of understanding this grave subject. They
usually plunge into the subject matter of the rasa dance, which 15 misun-
derstood by the foolish class of men. Some of them take this to be
immoral, while others try to cover it up by their own stupid interpreta-
tions. They have no desire to follow in the footsteps of $a Sukadeva
Gosvami.


--- Page 57 ---
Text 4] Questions by the Sages 59
One should conclude, therefore, that the serious student of the 7050
should receive the message of Bhdgavatam in the chain of disciplic suc-
cession from Srila Sukadeva Gosvami, who describes the Bhagavatam from
its very beginning and not whimsically to satisfy the mundaner who has
very little knowledge in transcendental science. Srimad-Bhdgavatam is so
carefully presented that a sincere and serious person can at once enjoy the
ripened fruit of Vedic knowledge simply by drinking the nectarean juice
through the mouth of Sukadeva Gosvami or his bona fide representative.

TRANSLATION
Once, in a holy place in the forest of Naimisaranya, great sages headed
by the sage Saunaka assembled to perform a great thousand-year sacrifice
for the satisfaction of the Lord and His devotees.
PURPORT
The prelude of the Srimad-Bhdgavatam was spoken in the previous
three slokas. Now the main topic of this great literature is being presented.
Srimad-Bhagavatam, after its first recitation by Srila Sukadeva Gosvami,
was repeated for the second time at Naimisaranya.
In the Vayaviya Tantra, it is said that Brahma, the engineer of this
particular universe, contemplated a great wheel which could enclose the
universe. The hub of this great circle was fixed at a particular place known


--- Page 58 ---
60 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 1
as Naimisaranya. Similarly, there is another reference to the forest of
Naimisaranya in the Varaha Purana, where it is stated that by performance
of sacrifice at this place, the strength of demoniac people is curtailed. Thus
brahmanas prefer Naimisaranya for such sacrificial performances.

The devotees of Lord Visnu offer all kinds of sacrifices for His pleasure.
The devotees are always attached to service of the Lord, whereas fallen
souls are attached to the pleasures of material existence. In Bhagavad-gita,
it is said that anything performed in the material world for any reason
other than for the pleasure of Lord Visnu causes further bondage for the
performer. It is enjoined therefore that all acts must be performed sacrifi-
cially for the satisfaction of Visnu and His devotees. This will bring every-
one peace and prosperity.

The great sages are always anxious to do good to the people in general,
and as such the sages headed by Saunaka and others assembled at this holy
place of Naimisaranya with a program of performing a great and con-
tinuous chain of sacrificial ceremonies. Forgetful men do not know the
right path for peace and prosperity. However, the sages know it well, and
therefore for the good men they are always anxious to perform acts which
may bring about peace in the world. They are sincere friends to all living
entities, and at the risk of great personal inconvenience they are always
engaged in the service of the Lord for the good of all people. Lord Visnu
is just like a great tree, and all others, including the demigods, men,
Siddhas, Caranas, Vidyadharas and other living entities, are like branches,
twigs and leaves of that tree. By pouring water on the root of the tree,
all the parts of the tree are automatically nourished. Only those branches
and leaves which are detached cannot be so satisfied. Detached branches
and leaves dry up gradually despite all watering attempts. Similarly, human
society, when it is detached from the Personality of Godhead like detached
branches and leaves, is not capable of being watered, and one attempting
to do so is simply wasting his energy and resources.

The modern materialistic society is detached from its relation to the
Supreme Lord. And all its plans which are being made by atheistic leaders
are sure to be baffled in every step. Yet they do not wake up to this.

In this age, the congregational chanting of the holy names of the Lord
is the prescribed method for waking up. The ways and means are most
scientifically presented by Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and intelligent
persons may take advantage of His teachings in order to bring about real
peace and prosperity. Srimad-Bhagavatam is also presented for this same
purpose, and this will be explained more specifically later in the text.

TRANSLATION
One day, after finishing their morning duties by burning a sacrificial
fire and respectfully offering a seat to Srila Sita Gosvami, the great sages
made earnest inquiries about the following matters.
PURPORT
Morning is the best time to hold spiritual services. The great sages
offered the speaker of the Bhagavatam an elevated seat of respect called
the Vydsdsana, or the seat of Sri Vyasadeva. Sri Vyasadeva is the original
spiritual preceptor for all men. And all other preceptors are considered to
be his representatives. A representative is one who can exactly present the
viewpoint of Sri Vyasadeva. Sri Vyasadeva impregnated the message of
Bhagavatam unto Srila Sukadeva Gosvami, and Sri Sita Gosvami heard
it from him (Sr Sukadeva Gosvami). All bona fide representatives of Sa
Vyasadeva in the chain of disciplic succession are to be understood to be
Gosvamis. These Gosvamis restrain all their senses, and they stick to the
path made by the previous dcaryas. The Gosvamis do not deliver lectures
on the Bhagavatam capriciously. Rather, they execute their services most
carefully, following their predecessors who delivered the spiritual message
unbroken to them.
Those who listen to the Bhagavatam may put questions to the speaker
in order to elicit the clear meaning, but this should not be done in a

challenging spirit. One must submit questions with a great regard for the
speaker and the subject matter. This is also the way recommended in
Bhagavad-gita. One must learn the transcendental subject by submissive
aural reception from the right sources. Therefore these sages addressed
the speaker 3008 Gosvami with great respect.

PURPORT
A Gosvami, or the bona fide representative of Sri Vyasadeva, must be
free from all kinds of vices. The four major vices of Kali-yuga are 1.) illicit
connection with women, 2.) animal slaughter, 3.) intoxication, 4.) specula-
tive gambling of all sorts. A Gosvami must be free from all these vices
before he can dare sit on the Vyasasana. No one should be allowed to sit
on the Vyasasana who is not spotless in character and who is not freed

from the above mentioned vices. He should not only be freed from all such
vices, but he must also be well versed in all revealed scriptures or in the
Vedas. The Purdpas are also parts of the Vedas. And histories like the
Mahabharata or Ramayana are also parts of the Vedas. The dcarya or the
gosvami must be well acquainted with all these literatures. To hear and
explain them is more important than reading them. One can only assimi-
late the knowledge of the revealed scriptures by hearing and explaining.
Hearing is called $ravana, and explaining is called kirtana. The two
processes of sravapa and kirtana are of primary importance to progressive
spiritual life. Only one who has properly grasped the transcendental
knowledge from the right source by submissive hearing can properly
explain the subject.

author of both Vedanta-sitras as well as Srimad-Bhagavatam or the
essence of all Vedic literatures. Besides Vyasadeva, there are other sages
who are the authors of six different philosophical systems, namely
Gautama, Kanada, Kapila, Patafijali, Jaimini and Astavakra. Theism is
explained completely in the Vedanta-siitra, whereas in other systems of
philosophical speculations, practically no mention is given to the ultimate
cause of all causes. One can sit on the Vydsasana only after being conver-
sant in all systems of philosophy so that one can present fully the
theistic views of the Bhagavatam in defiance of all other systems. Srila Sita
Gosvami was the proper teacher, and therefore the sages at Naimisaranya
elevated him to the Vydsasana. Srila Vyasadeva is designated herein as the
Personality of Godhead because he is the authorized incarnation.

The secret of success in spiritual life is in satisfying the spiritual master
and thereby getting His sincere blessings. Srila Viévanatha Cakravarti
Thakur has sung in his famous eight stanzas on the spiritual master as
follows: “I offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of my

spiritual master. Only by his satisfaction can one please the Personality of
Godhead, and when he is dissatisfied there is only havoc on the path of
spiritual realization.” It is essential, therefore, that a disciple be very much
obedient and submissive to the bona fide spiritual master. Srila Sita
Gosvami fulfilled all these qualifications as a disciple, and therefore he was
endowed with all favors by his learned and self-realized spiritual masters
such as Srila Vyisadeva and others. The sages of Naimisiranya were
confident that Srila Suita Gosvami was bona fide. Therefore they were

PURPORT
In Bhagavad-gita, worship of the dcarya is recommended. The dcaryas
and the gosvamis are always well-wishers for the general public. They are
especially spiritual well-wishers. Spiritual well-being is automatically fol-
lowed by material well-being. The dcaryas therefore give directions in
spiritual well-being for the people in general. Foreseeing the incompetencies

of the people in this age of Kali, or the iron age of quarrel, the sages
requested that Sita Gosvaml give a summary of all revealed scriptures
because the people of this age are condemned in every respect. The sages,
therefore, inquired of the absolute good, which is the ultimate good for
the people. The condemned state of affairs of the people of this age is
described as follows.

TRANSLATION
O learned one, in this iron age of Kali men have but short lives. They
are quarrelsome, lazy, misguided, unlucky and above all, always disturbed.
PURPORT

The devotees of the Lord are always anxious for the spiritual improve-
ment of the general public. When the sages of Naimisaranya analyzed the
state of affairs of the people in this age of Kali, they foresaw that men
would live short lives. In Kali-yuga, the duration of life is shortened not
so much because of insufficient food but because of irregular habits.
By keeping regular habits and eating simple food, any man can maintain
his health. Overeating, over sense gratification, over dependence on
another’s mercy, and artificial standards of living sap the very vitality of
human energy. Therefore the duration of life is shortened.

The people of this age are also very lazy, not only materially but in the


--- Page 65 ---
Text 11] Questions by the Sages 67
matter of self-realization. The human life is especially meant for self-
realization. That is to say, man should come to know what he is, what the
world is, and what the supreme truth is. Human life is a means by which
the living entity can end all miseries of material existence which arise in the
hard struggle for existence and by which he can return to Godhead, his
eternal home. But, due to a bad system of education, men have no desire
for self-realization. Even if they come to know about it, they unfortunately
become victims of misguided teachers.

In this age, men are not only victims of different political creeds and
parties, but also of many different types of sense-gratificatory diversions,
namely cinemas, sports, gambling, clubs, mundane libraries, bad associa-
tions, smoking, drinking, cheating, pilfering, bickerings, and so on. Their
minds are always disturbed and full of anxieties due to so many different
engagements. In this age, many unscrupulous men manufacture their own
religious faiths which are not based on any revealed scriptures, and very
often people who are addicted to sense gratification are attracted by such
institutions. Consequently, in the name of religion so many sinful acts
are being carried on, and the people in general have neither peace of mind
nor health of body. The student (brahmacdri) communities are no longer
being maintained, and householders do not observe the rules and regula-
tions of the grhastha-asrama. Consequently, the so-called vanaprastha and
sannydst who come out of such grhastha-asramas are easily deviated from
the rigid path. In the Kali-yuga the whole atmosphere is surcharged with
faithlessness. Men are no longer interested in spiritual values. Material
sense gratification is now the standard of civilization. For the main-
tenance of such material civilizations, man has formed complex nations
and communities, and there is a constant strain of hot and cold wars
between these different groups. It has become very difficult, therefore, to
raise the spiritual standard due to the present distorted values of human
society. The sages of Naimisaranya are anxious to disentangle all fallen
souls, and here they are seeking the remedy from Srila Sita Gosvami.

TRANSLATION

There are many varieties of scriptures, and in all of them there are many
prescribed duties which can be learned only after many years of study.
Therefore, O sage, please select the essential teachings of all these scrip-
tures and explain them for the good of all living beings, that by such
instruction their hearts may be satisfied.

PURPORT

Atma or self is distinguished from matter and material elements. It is
spiritual in constitution, and thus it is never satisfied by any amount of
material planning. All scriptures and spiritual instructions are meant for
the satisfaction of this self or atmd. There are many varieties of approaches
which are recommended for different types of living beings in different
times and at different places. Consequently, the numbers of revealed
scriptures are innumerable. There are different methods and prescribed
duties recommended in these various scriptures. Taking into consideration
the fallen condition of the people in general in this age of Kali, the sages
of Naimisiranya suggested that Sri Sita Gosvami relate the essence of all
such scriptures because in this age it is not possible for the fallen souls to
understand and undergo all the lessons of all these various scriptures in a
varpa and 65707710 system.

The ৮৫170 and 0570710 society was considered to be the best institution
for lifting the human being to the spiritual platform, but due to Kali-yuga
it is not possible to execute the rules and regulations of these institutions.
Nor is it possible for the people in general to completely sever relations
with their families as the varpasrama institution prescribes. The whole

Text 12] Questions by the Sages 69
atmosphere is surcharged with opposition. And considering this, one can
see that spiritual emancipation for the common man in this age is very
difficult. The reason for the sages’ inquiry into this matter is explained in
the following verse.

executing.
TRANSLATION
All blessings upon you, 0 Sita Gosvami. You know for what purpose
the Personality of Godhead appeared in the womb of Devaki as the son of
Vasudeva.
PURPORT
Bhagavan means the Almighty God who is the controller of all opu-
lences, power, fame, beauty, knowledge and renunciation. He is the
protector of His pure devotees. Although God is equally disposed to
everyone, He is especially inclined to His devotees. Sat means the Absolute
Truth. And persons who are servitors of the Absolute Truth are called
satvatas. And the Personality of Godhead who protects such pure devotees
is known as the protector of the satvatas. Bhadram or “blessings upon
you” indicates the sages’ anxiety to know the Absolute Truth from the
speaker. Lord Sri Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, appeared
to Devaki, the wife of Vasudeva. Vasudeva is the symbol of the transcen-
dental position wherein the appearance of the Supreme Lord takes place.

TRANSLATION
Enlighten us, O Sita, about the Personality of Godhead and His incar-
nations. We are eager to learn those teachings imparted by previous
masters [acaryas], for one is uplifted by hearing them.
PURPORT
The conditions for hearing the transcendental message of the Absolute
Truth are set forth herein. The first condition is that the audience must
be very sincere and eager to hear. And the speaker must be in the line of
disciplic succession from the recognized ৫০৫7৫. The transcendental message
of the Absolute is not understandable by those who are materially
absorbed. Under the direction of a bona fide spiritual master, one becomes
gradually purified. Therefore, one must be in the chain of disciplic
succession and learn the spiritual art by submissive hearing. In the case of
Sita Gosvami and the sages of Naimisdranya, all these conditions are
fulfilled because Srila Siita Gosvami is in the line of Srila Vyasadeva, and
the sages of Naimisaranya are all sincere souls who are anxious to learn
the truth. Thus the transcendental topics of Lord Sri Krsna’s superhuman
activities, His incarnation, His birth, appearance or disappearance, His
forms, His names and so on are all easily understandable because all
requirements are fulfilled. Such discourses help all men on the path of
spiritual realization.

TRANSLATION
Living beings who are entangled in the meshes of birth and death can
be freed immediately by even unconsciously chanting the holy name of
Krsna, which is feared by fear personified.
PURPORT
Vasudeva or Lord Krsna, the Absolute Personality of Godhead, is the
supreme controller of everything. There is no one in creation who is not
afraid of the rage of the Almighty. Great asuras like Ravana, Hiranyakasipu,
Karhsa, and others who were very powerful living entities were all killed by
the Personality of Godhead. And the almighty Vasudeva has empowered
His name with the powers of His personal Self. Everything is related to
Him, and everything has its identity in Him. It is stated herein that the
name of Krsna is feared even by fear personified. This indicates that the
name of Krsna is nondifferent from Krsna. Therefore, the name of Krsna
is as powerful as Lord Krsna Himself. There is no difference at all. Anyone,
therefore, can take advantage of the holy names of Lord Sri Krsna even in
the midst of greatest dangers. The transcendental name of Krsna, even
though uttered unconsciously or by force of circumstances, can help one
obtain freedom from the hurdle of birth and death.

TRANSLATION
0 Sita, those great sages who have completely taken shelter of the
lotus feet of the Lord can at once sanctify those who come in touch
with them, whereas the waters of the Ganges can sanctify only after
prolonged use.
PURPORT
Pure devotees of the Lord are more powerful than the waters of the
sacred river Ganges. One can derive spiritual benefit out of prolonged use
of the Ganges waters. But one can be sanctified at once by the mercy of a
pure devotee of the Lord. In Bhagavad-gitd it is said that any person,
regardless of birth as Sidra, woman, or merchant, can take shelter of the
lotus feet of the Lord and by so doing can return to Godhead. To take
shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord means to take shelter of the pure
devotees. The pure devotees whose only business is serving are honored
by the names Prabhupdda and Vispupdda, which indicate such devotees to
be representatives of the lotus feet of the Lord. Anyone, therefore, who
takes shelter of the lotus feet of a pure devotee by accepting the pure
devotee as his spiritual master can be at once purified. Such devotees of
the Lord are honored equally with the Lord because they are engaged in
the most confidential service of the Lord, for they deliver out of the
material world the fallen souls whom the Lord wants to return home, back
to Godhead. Such pure devotees are better known as vice-lords according
to revealed scriptures. The sincere disciple of the pure devotee considers
the spiritual master equal to the Lord, but always considers himself to be
a humble servant of the servant of the Lord. This is the pure devotional
path.

TRANSLATION
Who is there, desiring deliverance from the vices of the Age of Kali,
who is not willing to hear the glories of the Lord?
PURPORT
The Age of Kali is the most condemned age due to its quarrelsome
features. Kali-yuga is so saturated with vicious habits that there is a great
fight at the slightest misunderstanding. Those who are engaged in the pure
devotional service of the Lord, who are without any desire for self-
aggrandizement and who are freed from the effects of fruitive actions
and dry philosophical speculations are capable of getting out of the
estrangements of this complicated age. The leaders of the people are very
much anxious to live in peace and friendship, but they have no information
of the simple method of hearing the glories of the Lord. On the contrary,
such leaders are opposed to the propagation of the glories of the
Lord. In other words, the foolish leaders want to completely deny
the existence of the Lord. In the name of secular state, such leaders
are enacting various plans every year. But by the insurmountable
intricacies of the material nature of the Lord, all these plans for pro-
gress are being constantly frustrated. They have no eyes to see that
their attempts at peace and friendship are failing. But here is the hint to
get over the hurdle. If we want actual peace, we must open the road to
understand the Supreme Lord Krsna and glorify Him for His virtuous
activities as they are depicted in the pages of the Srimad-Bhagavatam.

His transcendental acts are magnificent and gracious, and great learned

PURPORT
The Personality of Godhead is never inactive as some less intelligent
persons suggest. His works are magnificent and magnanimous. His creations
both material and spiritual are all wonderful and contain all variegatedness.
They are described nicely by such liberated souls as Srila Narada, Vyasa,
Valmiki, Devala, Asita, Madhva, Sri Caitanya, Ramanuja, Visnusvami,
Nimbarka, Sridhara, Visvanitha, Baladeva, Bhaktivinode, Siddhanta Sara-
svat and many other learned and self-realized souls. These creations, both
material and spiritual, are full of opulence, beauty, and knowledge, but
the spiritual realm is more magnificent due to its being full of knowledge,
bliss and eternity. The material creations are manifested for some time as
perverted shadows of the spiritual kingdom and can be likened to cinemas.
They attract people of less intelligent caliber who are attracted by false
things. Such foolish men have no information of the reality, and they
take it for granted that the false material manifestation is the all in all.
But more intelligent men guided by sages like Vyasa and Narada know
that the eternal kingdom of God is more delightful, larger, and eternally
full of bliss and knowledge. Those who are not conversant with the

Text 18] Questions by the Sages 75
activities of the Lord and His transcendental realm are sometimes favored
by the Lord in His adventures as incarnations whérein He displays the
eternal bliss of His association in the transcendental realm. By such
activities He attracts the conditioned souls of the material world. Some of
these conditioned souls are engaged in the false enjoyment of material
senses and others in simply negating their real life in the spiritual world.
These less intelligent persons are known as karmis or fruitive workers, and
the others are known as jiianis or dry mental speculators. But above these
two classes of men is the transcendentalist known as satvata or the devotee
who is neither busy with rampant material activity nor with material
speculation. He is engaged in the positive service of the Lord, and thereby
he derives the highest spiritual benefit unknown to the karmis and janis.

As the supreme controller of both the material and spiritual worlds, the
Lord has different incarnations of unlimited categories. Incarnations like
Brahma, Rudra, Manu, Prthu, Vyasa and so on are His material qualitative
incarnations, but His incarnations like Rama, Narasimha, Varaha, Vamana,
and so on are His transcendental incarnations. Lord Sri Krsna is the
fountainhead of all incarnations, and He is therefore the cause of all causes.

recorded in connection with the pastimes of the incarnations of the Lord

and therefore remain fresh even after repeated readings. For example, any-
one may read Bhagavad-gitd or the Srimad-Bhagavatam repeatedly through-
out his whole life and yet find in them new light of information. Mundane
news is static whereas transcendental news is dynamic, inasmuch as the
spirit is dynamic and matter is static. Those who have developed a taste
for understanding the transcendental subject matter are never tired of
hearing such narrations. One is quickly satiated by mundane activities,
but no one is satiated by transcendental or devotional activities. Uttama-
§loka indicates that literature which is not meant for nescience. Mundane
literature is in the mode of darkness or ignorance, whereas transcendental
literature is quite different. Transcendental literature is above the mode of
darkness, and its light becomes more luminous with progressive reading
and realization of the transcendental subject matter. The so-called liberated
personsare never satisfied by the repetition of the words ahari brahmasmi.
Such artificial realization of Brahman becomes hackneyed, and so to relish
real pleasure they turn to the narrations of the Srimad-Bhagavatam. Those
who are not so fortunate turn to altruism and worldly philanthropy. This
means the Mayavada philosophy is mundane, whereas the philosophy of
Bhagavad-gitd and Srimad-Bhdgavatam is transcendental.

78 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 1
PURPORT

The doctrines of anthropomorphism or that of zoomorphism are never
applicable to इतं Krsna or the Personality of Godhead. The theory that a
man becomes God by dint of penance and austerities is very much rampant
nowadays, especially in India. Since Lord Rama, Lord Krsna, and Lord
Caitanya Mahaprabhu were detected by the sages and saints to be the Per-
sonality of Godhead asindicated in revealed scriptures, many unscrupulous
men have created their own incarnations. This process of concocting an
incarnation of God has become an ordinary business, especially in Bengal.
Any popular personality with a few traits of mystic powers will display
some feat of jugglery and easily become an incarnation of Godhead by
popular vote. Lord Sri Krsna was not that type of incarnation. He was
actually the Personality of Godhead from the very beginning of His appear-
ance. He appeared before His so-called mother as four-armed Visnu. Then
at the request of the mother, He bec: me like a human child and at once
left her for another devotee at Gokula where He was accepted as the son of
Nanda Mahardja and Ya$oda Mata. Similarly, Sri Baladeva, the counter-
part of Lord Sri Krsna, was also considered a human child born of another
wife of Sri Vasudeva. In Bhagavad-gita, the Lord says that His birth and
deeds are transcendental and that anyone who is so fortunate as to know
the transcendental nature of His birth and deeds will at once become
liberated and eligible to return to the kingdom of God. So knowledge of
the transcendental nature of the birth and deeds of Lord Sri Krsna is
sufficient for liberation. In the Bhagavatam, the transcendental nature of
the Lord is described in nine cantos, and in the Tenth Canto His specific
pastimes are taken up. All this becomes known as one’s reading of this
literature progresses. It is important to note here, however, that the Lord
exhibited His divinity even from the lap of His mother, that His*deeds are
all superhuman (He lifted Govardhana Hill at the age of six), and that all
these acts definitely prove Him to be actually the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Yet, due to His mystic covering, He was always accepted as an
ordinary human child by His so-called father and mother and other rela-
tives. Whenever some herculean task was performed by Him, the father and
mother took it otherwise. And they remained satisfied with unflinching
filial love for their son. As such, the sages of Naimisaranya describe Him as
apparently resembling a human being, but actually He is the Supreme
Almighty Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION
Knowing well that the Age of Kali has already begun, we are assembled
here in this holy place to hear at great length the transcendental message of
God and in this way perform sacrifice.
PURPORT
This age of Kali is not at all suitable for self-realization as was Satya-
yuga, the golden age, or Tretd or Dvapara yugas, the silver and copper ages.
For self-realization, the people in Satya-yuga, living a lifetime of a hundred
thousand years, were able to perform prolonged meditation. And in Tretd-
yuga, when the duration of life was ten thousand years, self-realization
was attained by performance of great sacrifice. And in the Dvdpara-yuga
when the duration of life was for one thousand years, self-realization was
attained by worshipping the Lord. But in the Kali-yuga, the maximum
duration of life being one hundred years only and that combined with
various difficulties, the process of self-realization is recommended by
hearing and chanting of the holy name, fame, and pastimes of the Lord.
The sages of Naimisaranya began this process for the devotees of the Lord.
So they prepared themselves to hear the pastimes of the Lord over a period

of one thousand years. By the example of these sages one should learn
that regular hearing and recitation of the Bhagavatam is the only way for
self-realization. Other attempts are simply a waste of time, for they do not
give any tangible results. Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu preached this
system of Bhdgavata-dharma, and He recommended that all those who
were born in India should take the responsibility of broadcasting the
messages of Lord इप्‌ Krsna, primarily the message of Bhagavad-gita. And
when one is well established in the teachings of Bhagavad-gitd, he can take
up the study of Srimad-Bhagavatam for further enlightenment in self-
realization.

TRANSLATION

We think that we have met Your Grace by the will of providence, and
thus we accept you as captain of the ship for those who desire to
cross the dangerous ocean of Kali, which destroys all the good qualities
of a human being.

PURPORT

The age of Kali is very dangerous for the human being. Human life is
simply meant for self-realization, but due to this dangerous age, men have
completely forgotten the aim of life. In this age, the life span will gradually
decrease. People will gradually lose their memory, finer sentiments,
strength, and better qualities. A list of the anomalies for this age is given
in the Twelfth Canto of this work. And so this age is very difficult for

Text 23] Questions by the Sages 81
those who want to utilize this life for self-realization. The people are so
busy with sense gratification that they completely forget about self-
realization. Out of madness they frankly say that there is no need for self-
realization because they do not realize that this brief life is but a moment
on our great journey towards self-realization. The whole system of edu-
cation is geared to sense gratification, and if a learned man thinks it over,
he sees that the children of this age are being intentionally sent to the
slaughterhouses of so-called education. Learned men, therefore, must be
cautious of this dangerous age, and if they at all want to cross over the
dangerous ocean of Kali, they must follow the footsteps of the sages of
Naimisaranya and accept Sri Sita Gosvami or his bona fide representative
as the captain of the ship. The ship is the message of Lord Sti Krsna in the
shape of Bhagavad-gitd or the Srimad-Bhdgavatam.

PURPORT
Essentially religion is the prescribed codes enunciated by the Personality
of Godhead Himself. Whenever there is gross misuse or neglect of the


--- Page 80 ---
82 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 1
principles of religion, the Supreme Lord appears Himself to restore
religious principles. This is stated in Bhagavad-gita. Here the sages of
Naimisaranya are inquiring about these principles. The reply to this ques-
tion is given later. The Srimad-Bhagavatam is the transcendental sound
representation of the Personality of Godhead, and thus it is the full
representation of transcendental knowledge and religious principles.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the First Canto, First Chapter
of Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “Questions by the Sages.”

TRANSLATION

Srila Sita Gosvami said: Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto
that great sage [Sukadeva Gosvami] who can enter the hearts of all. When
he went away to take up the renounced order of life [sannyasa], leaving
home without undergoing the sacred thread ceremony, his father,
Vyasadeva, cried out to him, “011, my son!” Indeed, only the trees echoed
in response to the begrieved father.

PURPORT

The institution of varpa and asrama prescribes many regulative duties to
be observed by its followers. Such duties enjoin that a candidate willing to
study the Vedas must approach a bona fide spiritual master and request
acceptance as his disciple. The sacred thread is the sign of those who are
competent to study the Vedas from the acarya or the bona fide spiritual
master. Sri Sukadeva Gosvami did not undergo such a purificatory cere-
mony because he was a liberated soul from his very birth.

Generally, a man is born as an ordinary being, and by the purificatory
processes he is born for the second time. When he sees a new light and
seeks direction for spiritual progress, he approaches a spiritual master to


--- Page 83 ---
Text 3] Divinity and Divine Service 85
instruct him in the Vedas. The spiritual master accepts only the sincere
inquirer as his disciple and gives him the sacred thread. In this way a man
becomes twice-born, or a dvija. After qualifying as a dvija one may study
the Vedas, and after becoming well versed in the Vedas one becomes a
vipra. A wipra or a qualified brahmapa thus realizes the Absolute and
makes further progress in spiritual life until he reaches the Vaisnava stage.
The Vaisnava stage is the postgraduate status of a brihmana. A progressive
brahmapa must necessarily become a Vaisnava, for a Vaisnava is a self-
realized, learned brahmana.

Srila Sukadeva Gosvami was a Vaisnava from the beginning; therefore,
there was no need for him to undergo all the processes of the varnasrama
institution. Ultimately the aim of varpasrama-dharma is to turn a crude
man into a pure devotee of the Lord, or a Vaisnava. Anyone, therefore,
who becomes a Vaisnava accepted by the first-class Vaisnava or uttama-
adhikari Vaisnava is already considered a brahmana, regardless of his birth
or past deeds. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu accepted this principle and recog-
nized Srila Haridasa Thakur as the कल्ला) of the holy name, although
Thakur Haridasa appeared in a Mohammedan family. In conclusion, Srila
Sukadeva Gosvami was born a Vaisnava, and, therefore, brahminism was
included in him. He did not have to undergo any ceremonies. Any low
born person—be he a Kirata, Hapa, Andhra, Pulinda, Pulkhasa, Abhira,
Sumbha, Yavana, Khasidi or even lower—can be delivered to the
highest transcendental position by the mercy of Vaisnavas. Srila Sukadeva
Gosvami was the spiritual master of Sri Siita Gosvami, and therefore he
offers his respectful obeisances unto him before he begins his answers to
the questions of the sages at Naimisaranya.

Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto him [Suka], the spiritual
master of all sages, the son of Vyasadeva, who, out of his great compassion
for those gross materialists who struggle to cross over the darkest regions
of material existence, spoke this Purana [supplement to the Vedas], the
cream of Vedic knowledge, after having personally assimilated it by
experience.
PURPORT

In this prayer, Srila Siita Gosvami practically summarizes the complete
introduction of Srimad-Bhagavatam. Srimad-Bhagavatam is the natural
supplementary commentary on the Vedanta-sitras. The Vedanta-siitras or
the Brahma-siitras were compiled by Vyasadeva with a view to presenting
just the cream of Vedic knowledge. Srimad-Bhdgavatam is the natural
commentary on this cream. Srila Sukadeva Gosvimi was a thoroughly
realized master of the Vedanta-siitra, and consequently he also personally
realized the commentary, Srimad-Bhdgavatam. And just to show his
boundless mercy upon bewildered materialistic men who want to cross
completely over nescience, he recited for the first time this confidential
knowledge.

There is no point in arguing that a materialistic man can be happy. No
materialistic creature—be he the great Brahma or an insignificant ant—
can be happy. Everyone tries to make a permanent plan for happiness,
but everyone is baffled by the laws of material nature. Therefore the
materialistic world is called the darkest region of God’s creation. Yet the
unhappy materialists can get out of it simply by desiring to get out.
Unfortunately they are so foolish that they do not want to escape. There-
fore they are compared to the camel who relishes thorny twigs because


--- Page 85 ---
Text 4] Divinity and Divine Service 87
he likes the taste of the twigs mixed with blood. He does not realize that
itis his own blood and that his tongue is being cut by the thorns. Similarly,
to the materialist his own blood is as sweet as honey, and although he is
always harassed by his own material creations, he does not wish to escape.
Such materialists are called karmis. Out of hundreds of thousands of
karmis, only a few may feel tired of material engagement and desire to get
out of the labyrinth. Such intelligent persons are called jadnis. The
Vedanta-sitra is directed to such jidanis. But Srila Vyasadeva, being the
incarnation of the Supreme Lord, could foresee the misuse of the
Vedanta-sitra by unscrupulous men, and, therefore, he personally sup-
plemented the Vedanta-sitra with the Bhagavata Purana. It is clearly
said that this Bhdgavatam is the original commentary on the Brahma-
50875. Srila Vyasadeva also instructed the Bhagavatam to his own son,
Srila Sukadeva Gosvami, who was already at the liberated stage of
transcendence. Srila Sukadeva realized it personally and then explained it.
By the mercy of Srila Sukadeva, the Bhagavat-Vedanta-siitra is available
for all those sincere souls who want to get out of material existence.

Srimad-Bhagavatam is the one unrivalled commentary on Vedanta-siitra.
Sripada Sarikaracarya intentionally did not touch it because he knew that
it would be difficult for him to surpass the natural commentary. He wrote
his Sariraka-bhdsya, and his so-called followers deprecated the Bhagavatam
assome “new” presentation. One should not be misled by such propaganda
directed against the Bhdgavatam by the Mayavada school. From this
introductory 40010, the beginning student should know that Srimad-
Bhagavatam is the only transcendental literature meant for those who are
paramahariisas and completely freed from the material disease called
malice. The Mayavadis are envious of the Personality of Godhead despite
Sripada Saikaracarya’s admission that Narayana, the Personality of God-
head, is above the material creation. The envious Mayavadi cannot have
access to the Bhagavatam, but those who are really anxious to get out of
this material existence may take shelter of this Bhagavatam because it is
uttered by the liberated Srila Sukadeva Gosvami. It is the transcendental
torchlight by which one can see perfectly the transcendental Absolute
Truth realized as Brahman, Paramatma and Bhagavan.

unto Mother Sarasvati, the goddess of learning, and unto Srila Vyasadeva,
the author.
PURPORT

All the Vedic literatures and the Puranas are meant for conquering the
darkest region of material existence. The living being is in the state of
forgetfulness of his relation with God due to his being overly attracted to
material sense gratification from time immemorial. His struggle for existence
in the material world is perpetual, and it is not possible for him to get out
of it by making plans. If he at all wants to conquer this perpetual struggle
for existence, he must reestablish his eternal relation with God. And one
who wants to adopt such remedial measures must take shelter of literatures
such as the Vedas and the Purdnas. Foolish people say that the Puranas
have no connection with the Vedas. However, the Purdnas are sup-
plementary explanations of the Vedas intended for different types of men.
All men are not equal. There are men who are conducted by the mode of
goodness, others who are under the mode of passion and others who are
under the mode of ignorance. The Puranas are so divided that any class of
men can take advantage of them and gradually regain their lost position
and get out of the hard struggle for existence. Srila ৩01 Gosvami shows the
way of chanting the Puranas. This may be followed by persons who aspire
to be preachersof the Vedic literatures and the Puranas. Srimad-Bhagavatam
is the spotless Purdna, and it is especially meant for them who are desirous
to get out of the material entanglement permanently.

TRANSLATION
O sages, I have been justly questioned by you. Your questions are
worthy because they relate to Lord Krsna and so are of relevance to the
world’s welfare. Only questions of this sort are capable of completely
satisfying the self.
PURPORT

As it is stated hereinbefore, in the Bhagavatam the Absolute Truth is to
be known, so the questions of the sages of Naimisaranya are proper and
just because they pertain to Krsna, who is the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, the Absolute Truth. In Bhagavad-gita the Personality of Godhead
says that in all the Vedas there is nothing but the urge for searching after
Him, Lord Krsna (Bg. 15.15). Thus the questions that pertain to Krsna are
the sum and substance of all the Vedic inquiries.

The whole world is full of questions and answers. The birds, beasts and
men are all busy in the matter of perpetual questions and answers. In the
morning the birds in the nest become busy with questions and answers, and
in the evening also the same birds come back and again become busy with
questions and answers. The human being, unless he is fast asleep at night,
is busy with questions and answers. The businessmen in the market are busy
with questions and answers, and so also the lawyers in the court and the
students in the schools and colleges. The legislators in the parliament are
also busy with questions and answers, and the politicians and the press


--- Page 88 ---
90 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 2
representatives are all busy with questions and answers. Although they
go on making such questions and answers for their whole lives, they are
not at all satisfied. Satisfaction of the soul can only be obtained by questions
and answers on the subject of Krsna.

Krsna is our most intimate master, friend, father or son and object of
conjugal love. Forgetting Krsna, we have created so many objects of
questions and answers, but none of them are able to give us complete
satisfaction. All things—but Krsna—give temporary satisfaction only, so if
we are to have complete satisfaction we must take to the questions and
answers about Krsna. We cannot live for a moment without being questioned
or without giving answers. Because the S$rimad-Bhagavatam deals with
questions and answers that are related to Krsna, we can derive the highest
satisfaction only by reading and hearing this transcendental literature.
One should learn the Srimad-Bhagavatam and make an all-around solution
to all problems pertaining to social, political or religious matters. Srimad-
Bhagavatam and Krsna are the sum total of all things.

Text 6] Divinity and Divine Service 91
PURPORT

In this statement, Sri Siita Gosvimi answers the first question of the
sages of Naimisaranya. The sages asked him to summarize the whole range
of revealed scriptures and present the most essential part so that fallen
people or the people in general might easily take it up. The Vedas
prescribe two different types of occupation for the human being. One is
called the pravrtti-mdrga, or the path of sense enjoyment, and the other
is called the nivrtti-marga or the path of renunciation. The path of
enjoyment is inferior, but the path of sacrifice for the supreme cause is
superior. The material existence of the living being is a diseased condition
of actual life. Actual life is spiritual existence, or brehma-bhiita existence
where life is eternal, blissful and full of knowledge. Material existence
is temporary, illusory and full of miseries. There is no happiness at all.
There is just the futile attempt to get rid of the miseries, and temporary
cessation of misery is falsely called happiness. Therefore, the path of
progressive material enjoyment, which is temporary, miserable and illusory,
is inferior. But devotional service of the Supreme Lord, which leads one to
eternal, blissful and all-cognizant life, is called the superior quality of
occupation. This is sometimes polluted when mixed with the inferior
quality. For example, adoption of devotional service for material gain is
certainly an obstruction to the progressive path of renunciation. Renuncia-
tion or abnegation for ultimate good is certainly a better occupation than
enjoyment in the diseased condition of life. Such enjoyment only aggravates
the symptoms of disease and increases its duration. Therefore devotional
service of the Lord must be pure in quality, i.e., without the least desire
for material enjoyment. One should, therefore, accept the superior quality
of occupation in the form of devotional service of the Lord without any
tinge of unnecessary desire, fruitive action and philosophical speculation.
This alone can lead one to perpetual solace in His service.

We have purposely denoted dharma as occupation because the root
meaning of the word dharma is “that which sustains one’s existence.” A
living being’s sustenance of existence is to coordinate his activities with
his eternal relation with the Supreme Lord Krsna. Krsna is the central pivot
of living beings, and He is the all-attractive living entity or eternal form
amongst all other living beings or eternal forms. Each and every living
being has his eternal form in the spiritual existence, and Krsna is the eternal
attraction for all of them. Krsna is the complete whole, and everything
else is His part and parcel. The relation is one of the servant and the
served, and it is transcendental and is completely distinguished from our


--- Page 90 ---
92 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 2
experience in material existence. This relation of servant and the served
is the most congenial form of intimacy. One can realize it as devotional
service progresses. Everyone should engage himself in that transcendental
loving service of the Lord, even in the present conditional state of material
existence. That will gradually give one the clue to actual life and please
him to complete satisfaction.

By rendering devotional service unto the Personality of Godhead, Sri

PURPORT
Those who consider devotional service of the Supreme Lord इन Krsna
to be something like material emotional affairs may argue that in the
revealed scriptures, sacrifice, charity, austerity, knowledge, mystic powers
and similar other processes of transcendental realization are recommended.
According to them, bhakti, or devotional service of the Lord, is meant
for those who cannot perform the high-grade activities. Generally it is
said that the bhakti cult is meant for the Sidras, vai§yas and the less
intelligent woman class. But that is not the actual fact. The bhakti cult
is the topmost of all transcendental activities, and therefore it is simul-
taneously sublime and easy. It is sublime for the pure devotees who are


--- Page 91 ---
Text 8] Divinity and Divine Service 93
serious about getting in contact with the Supreme Lord, and it is easy for
the neophytes who are just on the threshold of the house of bhakti. It is a

eat science to achieve the contact of the Supreme Personality of Godhead
इ Krsna, and it is open for all living beings, including the sidras, vaisyas,
women or even those lower than the siadras who are called low-born—
so what to speak of the high-class men like the qualified brahmanas and the
great self-realized kings. The other high-grade activities designated as
sacrifice, charity, austerity, etc., areall corollary factors following the pure
and scientific bhakti cult.

The principles of knowledge and detachment are two important factors
on the path of transcendental realization. The whole spiritual process
leads to perfect knowledge of everything material and spiritual, and the
results of such perfect knowledge are that one becomes detached from
material affection and becomes attached to spiritual activities. Becoming
detached from material things does not mean becoming inert altogether,
as men with a poor fund of knowledge think. Naiskarma means not
undertaking such activities that will produce good or bad effects. Negation
does not mean negation of the positive. Negation of the nonessentials
does not mean negation of the essential. Similarly, detachment from
material forms does not mean nullifying the positive form. The bhakti
cult is meant for realization of the positive form. When the positive form
is realized, the negative forms are automatically eliminated. Therefore, with
the development of the bhakti cult, with the application of the positive
service to the positive form, one naturally becomes detached from inferior
things, and he becomes attached to superior things. Similarly, the bhakti
cult, being the supermost occupation of the living being, leads him out of
material sense enjoyment. That is the sign of a pure devotee. He is neither
a fool, nor is he engaged in the inferior energies, nor does he have material
values. This is not possible by dry reasoning. It actually happens by the
grace of the Almighty. In conclusion, one who is a pure devotee has all
other good qualities, namely knowledge, detachment, etc., but one who
has only knowledge or detachment is not necessarily well acquainted with
the principles of the bhakti cult. Bhakti is the supermost occupation of the
human being.

TRANSLATION
Duties [dharma] executed by men, regardless of occupation, are only

PURPORT

There are different occupational activities in terms of man’s different
conceptions of life. To the gross materialist who cannot see anything
beyond the gross material body, there is nothing beyond the senses. There-
fore his occupational activities are limited to concentrated and extended
selfishness. Concentrated selfishness centers around the personal body—
this is generally seen amongst the lower animals. Extended selfishness is
manifested in human society and centers around the family, society,
community, nation and world with a view to gross bodily comfort. Above
these gross materialists are the mental speculators who hover aloft in the
mental spheres, and their occupational duties involve making poetry,
philosophy or propagating some ism with the same aim of selfishness
limited to the body and the mind. But above the body and mind is the
dormant spirit soul whose absence from the body makes the whole range
of bodily and mental selfishness completely null and void. But less intelli-
gent people have no information of the needs of the spirit soul.

Because foolish people have no information of the soul and how it is
beyond the purview of the body and mind, they are not satisfied in the
performance of their occupational duties. The question of the satisfaction
of the self is raised herein. The self is beyond the gross body and subtle
mind. He is the potent active principle of the body and mind. Without
knowing the need of the dormant soul, one cannot be happy simply with

emolument of the body and mind. The body and the mind are but
superfluous outer coverings of the spirit soul. The spirit soul’s needs must
be fulfilled. Simply by cleansing the cage of the bird, one does not satisfy
the bird. One must actually know the needs of the bird himself.

The need of the spirit soul is that he wants to get out of the limited
sphere of material bondage and fulfill his desire for complete freedom.
He wants to get out of the covered walls of the greater universe. He wants
to see the free light and the spirit. That complete freedom is achieved
when he meets the complete spirit, the Personality of Godhead. There is
a dormant affection for God within everyone; spiritual existence is mani-
fested through the gross body and mind in the form of perverted
affection for gross and subtle matter. Therefore we have to engage
ourselves in occupational engagements that will evoke our divine con-
sciousness. This is possible only by hearing and chanting the divine activi-
ties of the Supreme Lord, and any occupational activity which does not
help one to achieve attachment for hearing and chanting the transcendental
message of Godhead is said herein to be simply a waste of time. This is
because other occupational duties (whatever ism they may belong to)
cannot give liberation to the soul. Even the activities of the salvationists
are considered to be useless because of their failure to pick up the fountain-
head of all liberties. The gross materialist can practically see that his
material gain is limited only to time and space, either in this world or the
other. Even if he goes up to the Svargaloka, he will find no permanent
abode for his hankering soul. The hankering soul must be satisfied by the
perfect scientific process of perfect devotional service.

TRANSLATION
All occupational engagements [dharmas] are certainly meant for
ultimate liberation. They should never be performed for material gain.
Furthermore, one who is engaged in the ultimate occupational service
[dharma] should never use material gain to cultivate sense gratification.
PURPORT

We have already discussed that pure devotional service of the Lord is
automatically followed by perfect knowledge and detachment from materi-
al existence. But there are others who consider that all kinds of different
occupational engagements, including those of religion, are meant for
material gain. The general tendency of any ordinary man in any part of the
world is to gain some material profit in exchange for religious or any other
occupational service. Even in the Vedic literatures for all sorts of religious
performances an allurement of material gain is offered, and most people
are attracted by such allurement or blessings of religiosity. Why are such
so-called men of religion allured by material gain? Because material gain
can enable one to fulfill desires, which in turn satisfy sense gratification.
This cycle of occupational engagements includes so-called religiosity fol-
lowed by material gain and material gain followed by fulfillment of desires.
Sense gratification is the general way for all sorts of fully occupied men.
But in the statement of Siita Gosvami, as per the verdict of the Srimad-
Bhagavatam, this is nullified by the present sloka.

One should not engage himself in any sort of occupational service for
material gain only. Nor should material gain be utilized for sense gratifi-
cation. How material gain should be utilized is described as follows.

TRANSLATION
Life’s desires should never be aimed at gratifying the senses. One should
desire to live only because human life enables one to inquire about the
Absolute Truth. This should be the goal of all works.
PURPORT

The completely bewildered material civilization is wrongly directed
towards the fulfillment of desires in sense gratification. In such civilization,
in all spheres of life, the ultimate end is sense gratification. In politics,
social service, altruism, philanthropy and ultimately in religion or even in
salvation, the very same tint of sense gratification is ever increasingly pre-
dominent. In the political field the leaders of men fight with one another
to fulfill their personal sense gratification. The voters adore the so-called
leaders only when they promise sense gratification. As soon as the voters
are dissatisfied in their own sense satisfaction, they dethrone the leaders.
The leaders almost always disappoint the voters by not satisfying their
senses. The same is applicable in all other fields; no one is serious about
the problems of life. Even those who are on the path of salvation desire to
become one with the Absolute Truth and desire to commit spiritual
suicide for sense gratification. But the Bhagavatam says that one should
not live for sense gratification. One should satisfy the senses only inso-
much as is required for self-preservation, and not for sense gratification.
Because the body is made of senses, which also require a certain amount of
satisfaction, there are regulative directions for satisfaction of such senses.
But the senses are not meant for unrestricted enjoyment. For example,
marriage or the combination of a man with a woman is necessary for
progeny, but it is not meant for sense enjoyment. In the absence of such
voluntary restraint, there is propaganda for family planning, but foolish
men do not know that family planning is automatically executed as soon
as there is search after the Absolute Truth. Seekers of the Absolute Truth
are never allured by unnecessary engagements in sense gratification because
the serious students seeking the Absolute Truth are always overwhelmed
with the work of researching the Truth. In every sphere of life, therefore,


--- Page 96 ---
98 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 2
the ultimate end must be seeking after the Absolute Truth, and that sort
of engagement will make everyone happy because they will be less engaged
in varieties of sense gratification. And what that Absolute Truth is is
explained as follows.

TRANSLATION
Learned transcendentalists who know the Absolute Truth call this
nondual substance Brahman, Paramatma or Bhagavan.
PURPORT
The Absolute Truth is both subject and object, and there is no qualita-
tive difference there. Therefore, Brahman, Paramatma and Bhagavan are
qualitatively one and the same. The same substance is realized as imper-
sonal Brahman by the students of the Upanisads, as localized Paramatma
by the Hiranyagarbhas or the yogis, and as Bhagavan by the devotees. In
other words, Bhagavan or the Personality of Godhead is the last word of
the Absolute Truth. Paramatma is the partial representation of the Person-
ality of Godhead, and impersonal Brahman is the glowing effulgence of
the Personality of Godhead, as the sun rays are to the sun-god. Less
intelligent students of either of the above schools sometimes argue in favor


--- Page 97 ---
Text 12] Divinity and Divine Service 99
of their own respective realization, but those who are perfect seers of the
Absolute Truth know well that the above three features of the one
Absolute Truth are different perspective views seen from different angles
of vision.

As it is explained in the first अनव of the First Chapter of the Bhaga-
vatam, the Supreme Truth is self-sufficient, cognizant and freed from the
illusion of relativity. In the relative world the knower is different from the
known, but in the Absolute Truth both the knower and the known are one
and the same thing. In the relative world the knower is the living spirit or
superior energy, whereas the known is inert matter or inferior energy.
Therefore, there is a duality of inferior and superior energy, whereas in the
absolute realm both the knower and the known are of the same superior
energy. There are three kinds of energies of the supreme energetic. There
is no difference between the energy and energetic, but there is a difference
of quality of energies. The absolute realm and the living entities are of the
same superior energy, but the material world is inferior energy. The living
being in contact with the inferior energy is illusioned, thinking he belongs
to the inferior energy. Therefore there is the sense of relativity in the
material world. In the Absolute there is no such sense of difference
between the knower and the known, and therefore everything there is
absolute.

100 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 2
TRANSLATION
That Absolute Truth is realized by the seriously inquisitive student or
sage who is well equipped with knowledge and who has become detached
by rendering devotional service and hearing the Vedanta-éruti.
PURPORT
The Absolute Truth is realized in full by the process of devotional ser-
vice to the Lord Vasudeva or the Personality of Godhead who is the
full-fledged Absolute Truth. Brahman is His transcendental bodily efful-
gence, and Paramatma is His partial representation. As such, Brahman or
Paramatma realization of the Absolute Truth is but a partial realization.
There are four different types of living beings, the karmis, the jiianis, the
yogis and the devotees. The karmis are materialistic, whereas the other
three are transcendental. The first-class transcendentalists are the devotees
who have realized the Supreme Person. The second-class transcendentalists
are those who have partially realized the plenary portion of the absolute
person. And the third-class transcendentalists are those who have barely
realized the spiritual focus of the absolute person. As stated in the
Bhagavad-gita and other Vedic literatures, the Supreme Person is realized
by devotional service, which is backed by full knowledge and detachment
from the material association. We have already discussed the point that
devotional service is followed by knowledge and detachment from material
association. As Brahman and Paramiatma realization are imperfect realiza-
tions of the Absolute Truth, so the means of realizing Brahman and
Paramitma, i.e., the paths of jiidna and yoga, are also imperfect means of
realizing the Absolute Truth. Devotional service, which is based on the
foreground of full knowledge combined with detachment from material
association fixed up on the aural reception of the Vedanta-sruti, is the
only perfect method of realizing the Absolute Truth by the seriously
inquisitive student. Devotional service is not, therefore, meant for the less
intelligent class of transcendentalist. There are three classes of devotees,
namely first, second, and third class. The third-class devotees, or the
neophytes, who have no knowledge nor are detached from the material
association, but who are simply attracted by the preliminary processes of
worshiping the Deity in the temple, are called material devotees. Material
devotees are more attached to material benefit than transcendental profit.
Therefore, one has to make definite progress from the position of material
devotional service to the second-class devotional position. In the second-


--- Page 99 ---
Text 13] Divinity and Divine Service 101
class position, the devotee can see four principles in the devotional line,
namely the Personality of Godhead, His devotees, the ignorant and the
envious. One has to raise himself at least to the stage of a second-class
devotee and thus become eligible to know the Absolute Truth.

A third-class devotee, therefore, has to receive the instructions of
devotional service from the authoritative sources of Bhdgavatam. The
number one Bhagavatam is the established personality of devotee, and the
other Bhagavatam is the message of Godhead. The third-class devotee has,
therefore, to go to the personality of devotee in order to learn the instruc-
tions of devotional service. Such a personality of devotee is not a profes-
sional man who earns his livelihood by the business of Bhagavatam. Such
a devotee must be a representative of Sukadeva Gosvami, like Sita
Gosvami, and must preach the cult of devotional service for the all-around
benefit of all people. A neophyte devotee has very little taste for hearing
from the authorities. Such a neophyte devotee makes a show of hearing
from the professional man to satisfy his senses. This sort of hearing and
chanting has spoiled the whole thing, so one should be very careful about
the faulty process. The holy messages of Godhead, as inculcated in the
Bhagavad-gita or in the Srimad-Bhdgavatam, are undoubtedly transcen-
dental subjects, but even though they are so, such transcendental matters
are not to be received from the professional man who spoils them like the
serpent spoils the milk simply by the touch of his tongue.

A sincere devotee must, therefore, be prepared to hear the Vedic litera-
ture like the Upanisads, Vedanta and other literatures left by the previous
authorities or Gosvamis, for the benefit of his progress. Without hearing
such literatures, one cannot make actual progress. And without hearing
and following the instructions, the show of devotional service becomes
worthless and therefore a sort of disturbance in the path of devotional
service. Unless, therefore, devotional service is established on the principles
of $ruti, smrti, purapa or paficaratra authorities, the make-show of
devotional service should at once be rejected. An unauthorized devotee
should never be recognized as a pure devotee. By assimilation of such
messages from the Vedic literatures, one can see the all-pervading localized
aspect of the Personality of Godhead within his own self constantly. This
is called samadhi.

TRANSLATION
0 best among the twiceborn, it is therefore concluded that the highest
perfection one can achieve, by discharging his prescribed duties [dharma]
according to caste divisions and order of life, is to please the Lord Hari.
PURPORT
Human society all over the world is divided into four castes and four
orders of life. The four castes are the intelligent caste, the martial caste,
the productive caste and the laborer caste. These castes are classified in
terms of one’s work and qualification, and not by birth. Then again there
are four orders of life, namely the student life, the householders life, the
retired and the devotional life. In the best interest of human society there
must be such divisions of life, otherwise no social institution can grow
up in a healthy state. And in each and every one of the above-mentioned
divisions of life, the aim must be to please the supreme authority of the
Personality of Godhead. This institutional function of human society is
known as the system of varpasrama-dharma, which is quite natural for
the civilized life. The varnasrama institution is constructed to enable
one to realize the Absolute Truth. It is not for artificial domination of one
division over the other. When the aim of life, i.e., realization of the
Absolute Truth, is missed by too much attachment for indriya-priti or
sense gratification, as it is already discussed hereinbefore, the institution
of the varpasrama is utilized by selfish men to pose an artificial predomi-
nance over the weaker section. In the Kali-yuga, or in the age of quarrel,
this artificial predominance is already current, but the saner section of the
people know it well that the division of castes and orders of life are
meant for smooth social intercourse and high thinking self-realization and
not for any other purpose.


--- Page 101 ---
Text 14] Divinity and Divine Service 103
Herein the statement of Bhagavatam is that the highest aim of life or
the highest perfection of the institution of the varnasrama-dharma is to
cooperate jointly for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord, which is also

confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita (Bg. 4.13).

TRANSLATION

Therefore devotees should constantly hear about, glorify, remember
and worship the Personality of Godhead [Bhagavan], who is their protector.

PURPORT
If realization of the Absolute Truth is the ultimate aim of life, it must
be carried out by all means. In any one of the above-mentioned castes
and orders of life, the four processes, namely glorifying, hearing, remember-
ing and worshiping, are general occupations. Without these principles of
life, no one can exist. Activities of the living being involve engagements in
these different four principles of life. Especially in modern society, all
activities are more or less dependent on hearing and glorifying. Any man
from any social status becomes a well-known man in human society
within a very short time if he is simply glorified truly or falsely in the
daily newspapers. Sometimes political leaders of a particular party are
also advertised by newspaper propaganda, and by such glorifying method


--- Page 102 ---
104 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 2
an insignificant man becomes an important man—within no time. But such
propaganda work by false glorification of an unqualified person cannot
bring about any good, either for the particular man or for the society.
There may be some temporary reactions to such propaganda, but there
are no permanent effects. Therefore such activities are a waste of time.
The actual object of glorification is the Supreme Personality of Godhead
who has created everything manifested before us. We have broadly dis-
cussed this fact from the beginning of the ‘janmady asya” sloka of this
Bhagavatam. The tendency to glorify others or hear others must be
turned to the real object of glorification—the Supreme Being. And that
will bring happiness.

TRANSLATION

With sword in hand, intelligent men cut through the labyrinthine knots
of reactionary work [karma] by remembering the Lord. Therefore who will
not pay attention to His message?

PURPORT

The spiritual spark contacted with material elements creates a knot
which must be cut if one wants to be liberated from the actions and
reactions of fruitive work. Liberation means freedom from the cycle of
reactionary work. This liberation automatically follows for one who
constantly remembers the transcendental pastimes of the Personality of


--- Page 103 ---
Text 16] Divinity and Divine Service 105
Godhead. This is because all activities of the Supreme Lord (His lila)
are transcendental to the modes of the material energy. They are all-
attractive spiritual activities, and therefore constant association with the
spiritual activities of the Supreme Lord gradually spiritualizes the con-
ditioned soul and ultimately severs the knot of material bondage.
Liberation from material bondage is, therefore, a by-product of devotion-
al service. Attainment of spiritual knowledge is not sufficient to insure
liberation. Such knowledge must be overcoated with devotional service so
that ultimately the devotional service alone predominates. Then liberation
is made possible. Even the reactionary work of the fruitive workers can
lead one to liberation when it is overcoated with devotional service. Karma
overcoated with devotional service is called karma-yoga. Similarly, empirical
knowledge overcoated with devotional service is called jiigna-yoga. But
pure bhakti-yoga is independent of such karma and [70710 because it alone
can not only endow one with liberation from the conditional life but can
also award one with the transcendental loving service of the Lord.
Therefore, any sensible man who is above the average man with a poor
fund of knowledge must constantly remember the Personality of Godhead
by hearing. about Him, by glorifying Him, by remembering Him and by
worshiping Him always, without cessation. That is the perfect way of
devotional service. The Gosvamis of Vrndavana who were authorized by
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu to preach the bhakti cult, rigidly followed this
rule and made immense literatures of transcendental science for our
benefit. They have chalked out ways for all classes of men in terms of the
different castes and orders of life in pursuance of the teachings of
Srimad-Bhagavatam and similar other authoritative scriptures.

TRANSLATION

O twice-born sages, by serving those devotees who are completely
freed from all vice, great service is done. By such service, one gains
affinity for hearing the messages of Vasudeva.

PURPORT

The conditioned life of a living being is caused by his revolting against
the Lord. There are men called deva, or godly living beings, and there are
men called asuras, or demons, who are against the authority of the Supreme
Lord. In the Bhagavad-gita (Sixteenth Chapter) a vivid description of the
asuras is given in which it is said that the asuras are put into lower and lower
states of ignorance life after life and so sink to the lower animal forms and
have no information of the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead.
These asuras are gradually rectified into God consciousness by the mercy
of the Lord’s liberated servitors in different countries according to the
supreme will. Such devotees of God are very confidential associates of the
Lord, and when they come to save the human society from the dangers
of godlessness, they are known as the powerful incarnations of the Lord,
as sons of the Lord or as servants of the Lord or as associates of the Lord.
But none of them falsely claim to be God themselves. This is a blasphemy
declared by the asuras, and the demoniac followers of such asuras also
accept pretenders as God or His incarnation. In the revealed scriptures
there is definite information of the incarnation of God. No one should be
accepted as God or an incarnation of God unless he is confirmed by the
revealed scriptures.

The servants of God are to be respected as God by the devotees who
actually want to go back to Godhead. Such servants of God are called
mahatmas, or the tirthas, and they preach according to particular time
and place. The servants of God urge people to become devotees of the
Lord. They never tolerate being called God. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu was
God Himself according to the indications of the revealed scriptures, but
He played the part of a devotee. People who knew Him to be God addressed
Him as God, but He used to block His ears with His hands and chant the
name of Lord Visnu. He strongly protested against being called God,
although undoubtedly He was God Himself. The Lord behaves so to warn


--- Page 105 ---
Text 17] Divinity and Divine Service 107
us against unscrupulous men who take pleasure in being addressed as God.
The servants of God come to propagate God consciousness, and intel-
ligent people should cooperate with them in every respect. By serving the
servant of God, one can please God more than by directly serving the
Lord. The Lord is more pleased when He sees that His servants are properly
respected because such servants risk everything for the service of the Lord
and so are very dear to the Lord. The Lord declares in the Bhagavad-gita
(Bg. 18.69) that no one is dearer to Him than one who risks everything to
preach His glory. By serving the servants of the Lord, one gradually gets
the quality of such servants, and thus one becomes qualified to hear the
glories of God. The eagerness to hear about God is the first qualification
of a devotee for entering the kingdom of God.

Sri Krsna, the Personality of Godhead, who is the Paramatma [Super-

heard and chanted.
PURPORT
Messages of the Personality of Godhead Sri Krsna are nondifferent
from Him. Whenever, therefore, offenseless hearing of God is undertaken,


--- Page 106 ---
108 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 2
it is to be understood that Lord Krsna is present there in the form of
transcendental sound, which is as powerful as the Lord personally. Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu, in His Siksdstakam, declares clearly that the holy
name of the Lord has all the potencies of the Lord and that He has
endowed His innumerable names with the same potency. There is no rigid
fixture of time, and anyone can chant the holy name with attention and
reverence at his convenience. The Lord is so kind to us that He can be
present before us personally in the form of transcendental sound, but
unfortunately we have no taste for hearing and glorifying the Lord’s name
and activities. We have already discussed developing a taste for hearing and
chanting the holy sound. It is done through the medium of service to the
pure devotee of the Lord.

The Lord is reciprocally respondent to His devotees. When He sees that
a devotee is completely sincere in getting admittance to the transcendental
service of the Lord and thus becomes eager to hear about Him, the Lord
acts from within the devotee in such a way that the devotee may easily go
back to Him. The Lord is more anxious to take us back into His kingdom
than we can desire. Most of us do not desire at all to go back to Godhead.
Only a very few men want to go back to Godhead. But anyone who
desires to go back to Godhead, ওযা Krsna helps in all respects.

One cannot enter into the kingdom of God unless one is perfectly
cleared of all sins. The material sins are products of our desires to lord it
over material nature. It is very difficult to get rid of such desires. Women
and wealth are very difficult problems for the devotee making progress on
the path back to Godhead. Many stalwarts in the devotional line fell
victim to these allurements and thus retreated from the path of liberation.
But when one is helped by the Lord Himself, the whole process becomes
as easy as anything by the divine grace of the Lord.

To become restless in the contact of women and wealth is not an
astonishment, because every living being is associated with such things
from a remote time, practically immemorial, and it takes time to recover
from this foreign nature. But if one is engaged in hearing the glories of
the Lord, gradually he realizes his real position. By the grace of God such

- a devotee gets sufficient strength to defend himself from the state of
disturbances, and gradually all disturbing elements are eliminated from his
mind.

TRANSLATION
By regularly hearing the Bhiagavatam and rendering service unto the
pure devotee, all that is troublesome to the heart is practically destroyed,
and loving service unto the glorious Lord, who is praised with transcen-
dental songs, is established as an irrevocable fact.
PURPORT
Here is the remedy for eliminating all inauspicious things within the
heart which are considered to be obstacles in the path of self-realization.
The remedy is the association of the Bhagavatas. There are two types of
Bhagavatas, namely the book Bhagavata and the devotee Bhagavata.
Both the Bhagavatas are competent remedies, and both of them or either
of them can be good enough to eliminate the obstacles. A devotee
Bhagavata is as good as the book Bhagavata because the devotee Bhagavata
leads his life in terms of the book Bhagavata, and the book Bhagavata is
full of information about the Personality of Godhead and His pure
devotees, who are also Bhagavatas. Bhagavata book and person are identical.
The devotee Bhagavata is a direct representative of Bhagavan, the
Personality of Godhead. So by pleasing the devotee Bhagavata one can
receive the benefit of the book Bhagavata. Human reason fails to understand
how by serving the devotee Bhagavata or the book Bhagavata one gets
gradual promotion on the path of devotion. But actually these are facts
explained by Srila Naradadeva, who happened to be a maidservant’s son
in his previous life. The maidservant was engaged in the menial service of
the sages, and thus he also came into contact with them. And simply by
associating with them and accepting the remnants of foodstuff left by the
sages, the son of the maidservant got the chance to become the great
devotee and personality, Srila Naradadeva. These are the miraculous


--- Page 108 ---
110 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 2
effects of the association of Bhagavatas. And to understand these effects
practically, it should be noted that by such sincere association of the
Bhagavatas one is sure to receive transcendental knowledge very easily,
and the result is that he becomes fixed in the devotional service of the
Lord. The more progress is made in devotional service under the guidance
of the Bhagavatas, the more one becomes fixed in the transcendental
loving service of the Lord. The messages of the book Bhagavata,
therefore, have to be received from the devotee Bhagavata, and the
combination of these two Bhagavatas will help the neophyte devotee to
make progress on and on.

TRANSLATION
At the time loving service is established in the heart, the modes of
passion [rajas] and ignorance [tamas] and lust and desire [kama]
disappear from the heart. Then the devotee is established in goodness
and he becomes happy.
PURPORT

A living being in his normal constitutional position is fully satisfied in
spiritual bliss. This state of existence is called brahma-bhiita or atmanandi
or the state of self-satisfaction. This self-satisfaction is not like the
satisfaction of the inactive fool. The inactive fool is in the state of foolish
ignorance, whereas the self-satisfied atmanandi is transcendental to the


--- Page 109 ---
Text 20] Divinity and Divine Service 111
material state of existence. This stage of perfection is attained as soon as
one is fixed up in irrevocable devotional service. Devotional service is not
inactivity, but the unalloyed activity of the soul.

The soul’s activity becomes adulterated in contact with matter, and as
such the diseased activities are expressed in the form of lust, desire,
hankering, inactivity, foolishness and sleep. The effect of devotional service
becomes manifest by complete elimination of these effects of passion and
ignorance. The devotee is fixed at once in the mode of goodness, and he
makes further progress to rise up to the position of Vasudeva, or the state
of unmixed sattva or suddha-sattva state. In this suddha-sattva state only
can one always see Krsna eye to eye by dint of pure affection for the
Lord.

A devotee is always in the mode of unalloyed goodness; therefore he
harms no one. But the nondevotee, however educated he may be, is
always harmful. A devotee is neither foolish nor passionate. The harmful,
foolish and passionate cannot be devotees of the Lord, however they may
advertise themselves as devotees by outward dress. A devotee is always
qualified with all the good qualities of God. Quantitatively such qualifica-
tions may be different, but qualitatively both of them are one and the
same.

--- Page 110 ---
112 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 2
PURPORT

In the Bhagavad-gita (Bg. 7.3) it is said that out of many thousands of
ordinary men, one fortunate man endeavors for perfection of life. Mostly
they are conducted by the modes of passion and ignorance, and thus they
are engaged always in lust, desire. hankerings, ignorance and sleep. Out of
many such manlike animals, there is actually a man who knows the
responsibility of human life and thus tries to make life perfect by following
the prescribed duties. And out of such many thousands of persons who
have thus attained success in human life, one may know scientifically
about the Personality of Godhead Sri Krsna. In the same Bhagavad-gita
(Bg. 18.55) it is also said that scientific knowledge of Sri Krsna is under-
stood only by the process of devotional service (bhak ti-yoga).

The very same thing is confirmed herein in the above words. No ordinary
man, or even one who has attained success in human life. can know
scientifically or perfectly the Personality of Godhead. Perfection of human
life is attained when one can understand that he is not the product of
matter but is in fact spirit. And as soon as one understands that he has
nothing to do with matter, he at once ceases his material hankerings and
becomes enlivened as a spiritual being. This attainment of success is
possible when one is above the modes of passion and ignorance. or, in
other words. when one is actually a brahmana by qualification. Brahmana
is the symbol of sattva-guna. or the mode of goodness. And others, who
are not in the mode of goodness. are either ksatriya, vai§ya, Sidra or less
than the sidras. The brahminical stage is the highest stage of human life
because of its good qualities. So one cannot be a devotee unless one at
least qualifies as a brahmana. The devotee is already a brahmana by action.
But that is not the end of it. As referred to above, such a brahmana has to
become a Vaisnava in fact to be actually in the transcendental stage. A
pure Vaisnava is a liberated soul and is transcendental to the position of a
brahmana even. In the material stage even a brdhmana is also a conditioned
soul because in the brahminical stage the conception of Brahman or
transcendence is realized. but in that stage scientific knowledge of the
Supreme Lord is lacking. One has to surpass the brahminical
stage and reach the Vasudeva stage to understand the Personality of
Godhead Krsna. The science of the Personality of Godhead is the subject
matter for study by the postgraduate students in the spiritual line. Fool-
ish men, or men with a poor fund of knowledge, do not understand the
Supreme Lord, and they interpret Krsna according to their respective
whims. The fact is, however, that one cannot understand the


--- Page 111 ---
Text 21] Divinity and Divine Service 113
science of the Personality of Godhead unless oneis freed from the contami-
nation of the material modes, even up to the stage of a 81011171010. When
a qualified brahmana factually becomes a Vaisnava, in the enlivened state
of liberation he can know what is actually the Supreme Lord.

TRANSLATION
Thus the knots of the heart and all misgivings are cut to pieces. The
chain of fruitive actions [karma] is terminated when one sees the self as
master.
PURPORT
Attainment of scientific knowledge of the Personality of Godhead means
seeing one’s own self simultaneously. As far as the identity of the living
being as spirit self is concerned, there are a number of speculations and
misgivings. The materialist does not believe in the existence of the spirit
self, and empiric philosophers believe in the impersonal feature of the
whole spint without individuality of the living beings. But the transcenden-
talists affirm that the soul and the Supersoul are two different identities
qualitatively one but quantitatively different. There are many other
theories, but all these different speculations are at once cleared off as soon
as ऽतं Krsna is realized in truth by the process of bhakti-yoga. Sri Krsna is
like the sun, and the materialistic speculations about the Absolute Truth
are like the darkest midnight. As soon as the Krsna sun is arisen within
one’s heart, the darkness of materialistic speculations about the Absolute
Truth and the living beings is at once cleared off. In the presence of the


--- Page 112 ---
114 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 2
sun, the darkness cannot stand, and the relative truths that were hidden
within the dense darkness of ignorance become clearly manifested by the
mercy of Krsna, who is residing in everyone’s heart as the Supersoul.

In the Bhagavad-gita (Bg. 10.11) the Lord says that in order to show
special favor to His pure devotees, He personally eradicates the dense
darkness of all misgivings by switching on the light of pure knowledge
within the heart of a devotee. Therefore, because of the Personality of
Godhead’s taking charge of illuminating the heart of His devotee, certainly
a devotee, engaged in His service in transcendental love, cannot remain in
darkness. He comes to know everything of the absolute and the relative
truths. The devotee cannot remain in darkness, and because a devotee is
enlightened by the Personality of Godhead, his knowledge is certainly
perfect. This is not the case for those who speculate on the Absolute
Truth by dint of their own limited power of approach. Such knowledge
is called parampard, or deductive knowledge coming down from the
authority to the submissive aural receiver bona fide by service and surren-
der. One cannot challenge the authority of the Supreme and know Him
also at the same time. He reserves the right of not being exposed to such a
challenging spirit of an insignificant spark of the whole subjected to the
control of illusory energy. The devotees are submissive, and therefore the
transcendental knowledge descends from the Personality of Godhead to
Brahma and from Brahma to his sons and disciples in succession. This
process is helped by the Supersoul within such devotees. That is the per-
fect way of learning transcendental knowledge.

This enlightenment perfectly enables the devotee to distinguish spirit
from matter because the knot of spirit and matter is untied by the Lord.
This knot is called ahankdra, and it falsely obliges a living being to become
identified with matter. As soon as this knot is loosened, therefore, all the
clouds of doubt are at once cleared off. He sees his master and fully
engages himself in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, making a
full termination of the chain of fruitive action. In material existence, a
living being creates his own chain of fruitive work and enjoys the good and
bad effects of those actions life after life. But as soon as he engages himself
in the loving service of the Lord, he at once becomes free from the chain
of karma. All his actions no longer create any reaction.

TRANSLATION
Therefore all transcendentalists have been rendering loving service with
great delight to Lord Krsna, the Personality of Godhead, from time imme-
morial because such devotional service is enlivening to the self.
PURPORT
Speciality of devotional service unto the Personality of Godhead Lord
Sti Krsna is specifically mentioned herein. Lord Sri Krsna is the svayam-
riipa Personality of Godhead, and all other forms of Godhead, beginning
from Sri Baladeva, Sarkarsana, Vasudeva, Aniruddha, Pradyumna,
Narayana, puruga-avataras, gunae-avatdras, lild-avataras, yuga-avataras and
many other thousands of manifestations of the Personality of Godhead, are
Lord Sri Krsna's plenary portions and integrated parts. The living entities
are separated parts and parcels of the Personality of Godhead. Therefore
Lord Sri Krsna is the original form of Godhead, and He is the last word in
the Transcendence. Thus He is more attractive to the higher transcendental-
ists who participate in the eternal pastimes of the Lord. In other forms of
the Personality of Godhead (except Sri Krsna and Baladeva) there is no fa-
cility for intimate personal contact, as in the case of the transcendental pas-
times of the Lord at Vrajabhiimi. The transcendental pastimes of Lord Sri
Krsna are not newly accepted, as argued by some less intelligent persons,
but His pastimes are eternal and are manifested in due course once in a day
of Brahmiji, as the sun rises on the eastern horizon at the end of every
twenty-four hours.

TRANSLATION
The transcendental Lord is indirectly associated with the three modes
of material nature, namely passion, goodness and ignorance, and just for
the material world’s creation, maintenance and destruction He accepts the
three qualitative forms of Brahma, Visnu and Siva. Of these three, all living
beings can derive ultimate benefit from Visnu, the form of the quality of
goodness.
PURPORT
That Lord Sri Krsna, by His plenary parts,should be rendered devotional
service as explained above, is confirmed by this statement. Lord Sri Krsna
and all His plenary parts are Vispu-tattva, or the Lordship of Godhead.
From Sri Krsna, the next manifestation is Baladeva. From Baladeva is
Sankarsana, from Sankarsana is Narayana, from Narayana there is the
second Sankarsana, and from this Sankarsana the Visnu puruse-avataras.
The Visnu or the Deity of the quality of goodness in the material world
is the purusa-avatara known as Ksirodakasayl Visnu or Paramatma. Brahma
is the deity of rajas (passion), and Siva of ignorance. They are the three
departmental heads of the three qualities of this material world. Creation
is made possible by the goodness of Visnu, and when it is required to be


--- Page 115 ---
Text 24] Divinity and Divine Service 117
destroyed, Lord Siva does it by tandava-nrtya. The materialists and the
foolish human beings worship Brahma and Siva respectively. But the pure
transcendentalists worship the form of goodness, Visnu, in His various
integrated forms and separated forms. The integrated forms are called
Godhead, and the separated forms are called the living entities or the
jivas. Both the jivas and Godhead have their original spiritual forms. Jivas
are sometimes subjected to the control of material energy, but the Visnu
forms are always controllers of energy. When Visnu, the Personality of
Godhead, appears in the material world, He comes to deliver the condi-
tioned living beings who are under the material energy. Such living beings
appear in the material world with intentions of being lords, and thus they
become entrapped by the three modes of nature. As such, the living
entities have to change the material coverings for undergoing different
terms of imprisonment. The prison house of the material world is created
by Brahma under instruction of the Personality of Godhead, and at the
conclusion of a kalpa the whole thing is destroyed by Siva. But as far as
maintenance of the prison house is concerned, it is done by Visnu, as much
as the state prison house is maintained by the state. Anyone, therefore,
who wishes to get out of this prison house of material existence, which is
full of miseries like repetition of birth, death, disease and old age, must
please Lord Visnu for such liberation. Lord Visnu is worshiped by
devotional service only, and if anyone has to continue prison life in the
material world, he may ask for relative facilities from the different demi-
gods like Siva, Brahma, Indra, Varuna, etc., for temporary relief. No
demigod can, however, release the imprisoned living being from the con-
ditioned life of material existence except Visnu. Therefore, the ultimate
benefit may be derived from Visnu, the Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION

Coal [firewood] is better than raw wood, and fire is even better, for
fire is the soul of Vedic sacrifice. Similarly passion [rajas] is better than
ignorance [tamas], but goodness [sattva] is best because by goodness one
can come to realize the Absolute Truth [Brahman].

PURPORT

As explained above, one can get release from the conditioned life of
material existence by devotional service to the Personality of Godhead. It
is further comprehended herein that one has to rise up to the platform of
the mode of goodness (sattva) so that one canbe eligible for the devotional
service of the Lord. But if there are impediments on the progressive path,
anyone, even from the platform of tamas, can gradually rise up to the
sattva platform by the expert direction of the spiritual master. Sincere
candidates must, therefore, approach an expert spiritual master for such
a progressive march, and the bona fide expert spiritual master is competent
to direct a disciple from any stage of life: tamas, rejas or sattva.

It is a mistake, therefore, to consider that worship of any quality or any
form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is equally beneficial. Except
Visnu, all separated forms are manifested under the conditions of material
energy, and therefore the forms of material energy cannot help anyone to
rise to the platform of sattva, which alone can liberate a person from the
material bondage.

The uncivilized state of life, or the life of the lower animals, is con-
trolled by the modes of tamas. The civilized life of man, with a passion for
various types of material benefits, is the stage of rajas. The rajas stage of
life gives a slight clue to the realization of the Absolute Truth in the forms
of fine sentiments in philosophy, art and culture with moral and ethical
principles, but the mode of sattva is a still higher stage of material quality,
which actually helps one in realizing the Absolute Truth. In other words,
there is a qualitative difference between the different kinds of worshiping
methods as well as the respective results derived from the predominating
deities, namely Brahma, Vispu and Hara.

Previously all the great sages rendered service unto the transcendental
Personality of Godhead [Bhagavan] due to His existence above the three
modes of material nature. They worshiped Him to become free from
material conditions. Whoever follows such sages is also eligible for libera-
tion from the material world.
PURPORT

The purpose of performing religion is neither to profit by material gain
nor to get the simple knowledge of discerning matter from spirit. The
ultimate aim of religious performances is to release oneself from material
bondage and regain the life of freedom in the transcendental world where
the Personality of Godhead is the Supreme Person. Laws of religion are,
therefore, directly enacted by the Personality of Godhead, and except the
mahdjanas, or the authorized agents of the Lord, no one knows the
purpose of religion. There are twelve particular agents of the Lord who
know the purpose of religion, and all of them render transcendental
service unto Him. Persons who desire their own good may follow these
mahdjanas and thus attain the supreme benefit.

TRANSLATION
Those who are serious about liberation are certainly nonenvious, and
they respect all. Yet they reject the horrible and ghastly forms of the
demigods and worship only the all-blissful forms and plenary portions of
Lord Vispu.
PURPORT

The Supreme Personality of Godhead Sri Krsna, who is the original
person of the Visnu categories, expands Himself in two different categories,
namely integrated plenary portions and separated parts and parcels. The
separated parts and parcels are the servitors, and the integrated plenary
portions of Vispu-tattvas are the worshipful objects of service.

All demigods who are empowered by the Supreme Lord are also
separated parts and parcels. They do not belong to the categories of Visnu-
tattva. The Visnu-tattvas are equally powerful living beings like the original
form of the Personality of Godhead, and they display only different
categories of power in consideration of different times and circumstances.
The separated parts and parcels are powerful by limitation. They do not
have unlimited power like the Visnpu-tattvas. Therefore, the Visnu-tattvas,
or the plenary portions of Narayana, the Personality of Godhead, are never
to be classified in the same categories with the parts and parcels. If anyone
does so he becomes at once an offender by the name pasandi. In the age of
Kali many foolish persons commit such unlawful offenses and equalize the
two categories.


--- Page 119 ---
Text 27] Divinity and Divine Service 121

The separated parts and parcels have different positions in the estima-
tion of material powers, and some of them are like Kalabhairava, Smasaha-
bhairava, Sani, Mahakali, Candika. These demigods are worshiped mostly
by those who are in the lowest categories of the mode of darkness or
ignorance, and there are others who are in the mode of passion and
worship demigods like Brahma, Siva, Siirya, 08688 and many similar
deities, urged by the desire for material enjoyment. But those who are
actually situated in the mode of goodness (sattva-guna) of material nature
worship only Visnu-tattvas. Visnu-tattvas are represented by various names
and forms such as Narayana, Dimodara, Vamana, Govinda, Adhoksaja,
১10. The qualified brahmanas worship the Visnu-tattvas represented by the
$alagrima-$ila, and so also some of the higher castes like the ksatriyas and
vai$yas worship the Visnu-tattvas generally.

Highly qualified brahmanas situated in the mode of goodness have no
grudges against the mode of worship of others. They have all respect for
other demigods, even though they are ghastly looking, like the Kala-
bhairava or Mahakali, etc. They know very well that these horrible
features of the Supreme Lord are all different servitors of the Lord under
different conditions, yet they reject the worship of both horrible and
attractive features of the demigods, and they concentrate only on the
forms of Visnu because they are serious about liberation from the ma-
terial conditions. The demigods, even to the stage of Brahma, the supreme
of all the demigods, cannot offer liberation to anyone. Hiranyakaipu
underwent a severe type of penance to become eternal in life, but his
worshipful deity, Brahma, could not satisfy him with such blessings.
Therefore Visnu is called mukti-pada, or the Personality of Godhead who
can bestow upon us mukti, liberation, and none else. The demigods, being
like other living entities in the material world, are all liquidated at the time
of the annihilation of the material structure. They are themselves unable
to get liberation, and what to speak of giving liberation to their devotees.
The demigods can award the worshipers some temporary benefit only and
not the ultimate one.

It is for this reason only that candidates for liberation deliberately reject
the worship of the demigods, although they have no disrespect for any one
of them.

TRANSLATION
Those who are in the modes of passion and ignorance worship the
forefathers, other living beings and the demigods who are in charge of
cosmic activities, for they are urged by a desire to be materially benefited
with women, wealth, power and aristocratic birth.
PURPORT

There is no need to worship demigods of whatsoever category if one is
serious about going back to Godhead. In the Bhagavad-gita (Bg. 7.20, 23)
it is clearly said that those who are mad after material enjoyment approach
the different demigods for temporary benefits, which are meant for men
with a poor fund of knowledge. We should never desire to increase the
depth of material enjoyment. Material enjoyment should be accepted
only up to the point of the bare necessities of life and not more or less
than that. To accept more material enjoyment means to bind oneself more
and more to the miseries of material existence. More wealth, more women
and false aristocracy are some of the demands of the materially disposed
man because he has no information of the benefit derived from Visnu
worship. By Visnu worship one can derive benefit in this life as well as in
life after death. Forgetting these principles, foolish people who are after
more wealth, more wives and more children worship various demigods.
The aim of life is to end the miseries of life and not to increase them.

For material enjoyment there is no need to approach the demigods. The
demigods are but servants of the Lord. As such, they are duty-bound to
supply necessities of life in the form of water, light, air, etc. One should
work hard and worship the Supreme Lord by the fruits of one’s hard
labor for existence, and that should be the motto of life. One should be

careful to execute occupational service with faith in God in the proper
way, and that will lead one gradually on the progressive march back to
Godhead.

Lord Sri Krsna, when He was personally present at Vrajadhama, stopped
the worship of the demigod Indra and advised the residents of Vraja to
worship by their business and to have faith in God. Worshiping the multi-
demigods for material gain is practically a perversity of religion. This sort
of religious activity has been condemned in the very beginning of the
Bhagavatam as kaitava-dharma. There is only one religion in the world to
be followed by one and all, and that is the Bhagavata-dharma,or the
religion which teaches one to worship the Supreme Personality of God-
head and no one else.

124 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch, 2
TRANSLATION

In the revealed scriptures, the ultimate object of knowledge is Sri
Krsna, the Personality of Godhead. The purpose of performing sacrifice is
to please Him. Yoga is for realizing Him. All fruitive activities are ulti-
mately rewarded by Him only. He is supreme knowledge, and all severe
austerities are performed to know Him. Religion [dharma] is rendering
loving service unto Him. He is the supreme goal of life.

PURPORT

That Sri Krsna, the Personality of Godhead, is the only object of
worship is confirmed in these two slokas. In the Vedic literature there is
the same objective: establishing one’s relationship and ultimately reviving
our lost loving service unto Him. That is the sum and substance of the
Vedas. In the Bhagavad-gita the same theory is confirmed by the Lord in
His own words: the ultimate purpose of the Vedas is to know Him only.
All the revealed scriptures are prepared by the Lord through His incarna-
tion in the body of Srila Vyasadeva just to remind the fallen souls
conditioned by material nature of Sri Krsna the Personality of Godhead.
No demigod can award freedom from material bondage. That is the
verdict of all the Vedic literatures. Impersonalists who have no informa-
tion of the Personality of Godhead minimize the omnipotency of the
Supreme Lord and put Him on equal footing with all other living
beings, and for this act such impersonalists get freedom from material
bondage with great difficulty. They can only surrender unto Him after
many, many births and culture of transcendental knowledge.

One may argue that the Vedic activities are based on sacrificial cere-
monies. That is true. But all such sacrifices are also meant for realizing the
truth about Vasudeva. Another name of Vasudeva is Yajha (sacrifice), and
in the Bhagavad-gita it is clearly stated that all sacrifices and all activities
are to be conducted for the satisfaction of Yajiia or Visnu the Personality
of Godhead. This is the case also with the yoga systems. Yoga means to
get into touch with the Supreme Lord. The process, however, includes
several bodily features such as asana, dhyana, pranayama, meditation, etc.,
and all of them are meant for concentrating upon the localized aspect of
Vasudeva represented as Paramatma. Paramatma realization is but partial
realization of Vasudeva, and if one is successful in that attempt, one
realizes Vasudeva in full. But by ill luck most of the yogis are stranded
by the powers of mysticism achieved through the bodily process. Ill-fated
yogis are given a chance in the next birth by being placed in the families of


--- Page 123 ---
Text 29] Divinity and Divine Service 125
good learned brahmanas or in the families of rich merchants in order to
execute the unfinished task of Vasudeva realization. If such fortunate
brahmanas and sons of rich men properly utilize the chance, they can
easily realize Vasudeva by good association with saintly persons. Unfor-
tunately, such preferential persons are captivated again by material wealth
and honor and practically forget the aim of life.

This is also so for the culture of knowledge. According to Bhagavad-gita
there are eighteen items in culturing knowledge. And by such culture of
knowledge one becomes gradually prideless, devoid of vanity, nonviolent,
forbearing, simple, devoted to the great spiritual master and self-controlled.
By culture of knowledge one becomes unattached to hearth and home and
becomes conscious of the miseries due to death, birth, old age and disease.
And all culture of knowledge culminates in devotional service to the
Personality of Godhead, Vasudeva. Therefore, Vasudeva is the ultimate aim
in culturing all different branches of knowledge. Culture of knowledge
leading one to the transcendental plane of meeting Vasudeva is real
knowledge. Physical knowledge in its various branches is condemned in the
Bhagavad-gitd as ajiidna, or the opposite of real knowledge. The ultimate
aim of physical knowledge is to satisfy the senses, which means prolonga-
tion of the term of material existence and thereby continuance of the
threefold miseries. So prolonging the miserable life of material existence
is nescience. But the same physical knowledge leading to the way of
spiritual understanding helps one to end the miserable life of physical
existence and to begin the life of spiritual existence on the plane of
Vasudeva.

The same applies to all kinds of austerities. Tapasya means voluntary
acceptance of bodily pains to achieve some higher end of life. Ravana and
Hiranyakasipu underwent a severe type of bodily torture to achieve the
end of sense gratification. Sometimes modern politicians also undergo
severe types of austerities to achieve some political end. This is not actually
tapasya. One should accept voluntary bodily inconvenience for the sake of
knowing Vasudeva because that is the way of real austerities. Otherwise all
forms of austerities are classified as modes of passion and ignorance.
Passion and ignorance cannot end the miseries of life. Only the mode of
goodness can mitigate the threefold miseries of life. Vasudeva and Devaki,
the so-called father and mother of Lord Krsna, underwent penances to get
Vasudeva as their son. Lord Sti Krsna is the father of all living beings
(Bg. 14.4). Therefore He is the original living being of all other living
beings. He is the original eternal enjoyer amongst all other enjoyers.
Therefore no one can be His begetting father, as the ignorant may think.


--- Page 124 ---
126 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 2
Lord Sri Krsna agreed to become the son of Vasudeva and Devaki upon
being pleased with their severe austerities. Therefore if any austerities have
to be done, they must be done to achieve the end of En Vasudeva.

Vasudeva is the original Personality of Godhead Lord Sri Krsna. As
explained before, the original Personality of Godhead expands Himself by
innumerable forms. Such expansion of forms is made possible by His
various energies. His energies are also multifarious, and His internal ener-
gies are superior and external energies are inferior in quality. They are
explained in the Bhagavad-gita (Bg. 7.4-6) as the para and apara prakrtis.
So His expansions of various forms which take place via the internal
energies are superior forms, whereas the expansions which take place via
the external energies are inferior forms. The living entities are also His
expansions. The living entities who are expanded by His internal potency
are eternally liberated persons, whereas those who are expanded by the
material energies are eternally conditioned souls. Therefore, all culture of
knowledge, austerities, sacrifice and activities should be aimed at changing
the quality of the influence that is acting upon us. For the present, we are
all being controlled by the external energy of the Lord, and just to change
the quality of the influence, we must endeavor to cultivate spiritual
energy. In the Bhagavad-gitd it is said that those who are mahatmds, or
those whose minds have been so broadened as to be engaged in the service
of Lord Krsna, are under the influence of the internal potency, and the
effect is that such broad-minded living beings are constantly engaged in the
service of the Lord without deviation. That should be the aim of life. And
that is the verdict of all the Vedic literatures. No one should bother him-
self with fruitive activities or dry speculation about transcendental knowl-
edge. Everyone should at once engage himself in the transcendental
loving service of the Lord. Nor should one worship different demigods who
work as different hands of the Lord for creation, maintenance or destruc-
tion of the material world. There are innumerable powerful demigods who
look over the external management of the material world. They are all
different assisting hands of Lord Vasudeva. Even Lord Siva and Lord
Brahma are included within the list of demigods, but Lord Visnu or
Vasudeva is always transcendentally situated. Even though He accepts the
quality of goodness of the material world, He is still transcendental to all
the material modes. The following example will clear that matter more
explicitly. In the prison house there are the prisoners and the managers of
the prison house. Both the managers and the prisoners are bound up by
the laws of the king. But even though the king sometimes comes in the

were also created by Him. He is, therefore, unaffected by the qualities of

After creating the material substance, the Lord expands Himself and
enters into it. And although He is within the material modes of nature and
appears to be one of the created beings, He is always fully enlightened and
in His transcendental position.
PURPORT

The living entities are separated parts and parcels of the Lord, and the
conditioned living entities who are unfit for the spiritual kingdom are
strewn within the material world to enjoy matter to the fullest extent.
As Paramitmia and eternal friend of the living entities, the Lord by one of
His plenary portions accompanies the living entities to guide them in
their material enjoyment and to become witness to all actvities. While
the living entities enjoy the material conditions, the Lord maintains His
transcendental position without being affected by the material atmosphere.

In the Vedic literatures (sruti) it is said that there are two birds in one
tree.* One of them is eating the fruit of the tree, while the other is wit-
nessing the actions. The witness is the Lord, and the fruit eater is the
living entity. The fruit eater (living entity) has forgotten his real identity
and is overwhelmed in the fruitive activities of the material conditions,
but the Lord (Paramatma) is always full in transcendental knowledge.
That is the difference between the Supersoul and the conditioned soul.
The conditioned soul, living entity, is controlled by the laws of nature,
while the Paramatma or the Supersoul is the controller of the material
energy.

130 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 2
PURPORT

Lord Vasudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by one of His
plenary parts expands Himself all over the material world, and His existence
can be perceived even within the atomic energy. Matter, anti-matter,
proton, neutron, etc., are all different effects of the Paramatma feature
of the Lord. As from wood, fire can be manifested, or as butter can be
churned out of milk, so also the presence of the Lord as Paramatma can be
felt by the process of legitimate hearing and chanting of the transcenden-
tal subjects which are श treated in the Vedic literatures like the
Upanisads and Vedanta. Srimad-Bhagavatam is the bona fide explanation
of these Vedic literatures. The Lord can be realized through the aural
reception of the transcendental message, and that is the only way to
experience the transcendental subject. As fire is kindled from wood by
another fire, similarly the divine consciousness of man can be kindled
by another divine grace. His Divine Grace the spiritual master can
kindle the spiritual fire from the woodlike living entity by imparting
proper spiritual messages injected through the receptive ear. Therefore one
is required to approach the proper spiritual master with receptive ear only,
and thus divine existence is gradually realized. The difference between
animality and humanity lies in this process only. A human being can hear
properly, whereas an animal cannot.

TRANSLATION

The Supersoul enters into the bodies of the created beings who are
influenced by the modes of material nature and causes them to enjoy the
effects of these by the subtle mind.

PURPORT

There are 8,400,000 species of living beings beginning from the highest
intellectual being Brahma down to the insignificant ant, and all of them
are enjoying the material world according to the desires of the subtle mind
and gross material body. The gross material body is based on the conditions
of the subtle mind, and the senses are created according to the desire of
the living being. The Lord as Paramatma helps the living being to get
material happiness because the living being is helpless in all respects to
obtain what he desires. He proposes and the Lord disposes. In another
sense, the living beings are parts and parcels of the Lord. They are there-
fore one with the Lord. In the Bhagavad-gita the living beings in all varieties
of bodies have been claimed by the Lord as His sons. The sufferings and
enjoyments of the sons are indirectly the suffering and enjoyments of the
father. Still the father is not in any way affected directly by the suffering
and enjoyment of the sons. He is so kind that He constantly remains with
the living being as Paramatma and always tries to convert the living being
towards the real happiness.

TRANSLATION
Thus the Lord of the universes maintains all planets inhabited by demi-
gods, men and lower animals, and in His play He assumes the roles of
incarnations to reclaim those in the mode of pure goodness.
PURPORT

There are innumerable material universes, and in each and every universe
there are innumerable planets inhabited by different grades of living enti-
ties in different modes of nature. The Lord (Visnu) incarnates Himself in
each and every one of them and in each and every type of living society.
He manifests His transcendental pastimes amongst them just to create the
desire to go back to Godhead. The Lord does not change His original
transcendental position, but He appears to be differently manifested
according to the particular time, circumstances and society.

Sometimes He incarnates Himself or empowers a suitable living being
to act for Him, but in either case the purpose is the same: the Lord wants
the suffering living being to go back home, back to Godhead. The happiness
which the living beings are hankering for is not to be found within any
corner of the innumerable universes and material planets. The eternal
happiness which the living being wants is obtainable in the kingdom of
God, but the forgetful living beings under the influence of the material
modes have no information of the kingdom of God. The Lord, therefore,
comes to propagate the message of the kingdom of God either personally
as an incarnation or through His bona fide representative as the good son
of God. Such incarnations or sons of God are not only making propaganda
for going back to Godhead within human society. Their work is also going

beings.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the First Canto, Second Chap-

PURPORT
The Bhagavad-gitd states that the Personality of Godhead Sri Krsna
maintains these material universes by extending His plenary expansions.
135


--- Page 140 ---
136 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 3
So this purusa form is the confirmation of the same principle. The original
Personality of Godhead Vasudeva or Lord Krsna, who is famous as the son
of King Vasudeva or King Nanda, is full with all opulences, all potencies,
all fames, all beauties, all knowledge and all renunciation. Part of His
opulences is manifested as impersonal Brahman, and part of His opulences
is manifested as Paramatma. This purusa feature of the same Personality
of Godhead Sri Krsna is the original Paramatma manifestation of the Lord.
There are three purusa features in the material creation, and this form, who
is known as the Karapodakasayi Visnu, is the first of the three. The others
are known as the Garbhodakasayi Visnu and the Ksirodakasayi Visnu,
which we shall know one after another. The innumerable universes are
generated from the skinholes of this Karanodakasayi Visnu, and in each
one of the universes the Lord enters as Garbhodakasayi Visnu.

In the Bhagavad-gita it is also mentioned that the material world is
created at certain intervals and then again destroyed. This creation and
destruction is done by the supreme will because of the conditioned souls
or the nitya-badhya living beings. The nitya-badhya or the eternally
conditioned souls have the sense of individuality or ahankara, which
dictates them sense enjoyment, which they are unable to have constitu-
tionally. The Lord is the only enjoyer, and all others are enjoyed. The
living beings are predominated enjoyers. But the eternally conditioned
souls, forgetful of this constitutional position, have strong aspirations to
enjoy. This chance to enjoy matter is given to the conditioned souls in the
material world, and side by side they are given the chance to understand
their real constitutional position. Those fortunate living entities who catch
the truth and surrender unto the lotus feet of Vasudeva after many, many
births in the material world, join the eternally liberated souls and thus are
allowed to enter into the kingdom of Godhead. After this, such fortunate
living entities need not come again within the occasional material creation.
But those who cannot catch the constitutional truth are again merged into
the mahai-tattva at the time of annihilation of the material creation. When
the creation is again set up, this mahat-tattva is again let loose. This
mahat-tattva contains all the ingredients of the material manifestations,
including the conditioned souls. Primarily this mahat-tattva is divided into
sixteen parts, namely the five gross material elements and the eleven
working instruments or senses. It is like the cloud in the clear sky. In the
spiritual sky, the effulgence of Brahman is spread all round, and the whole
system is dazzling in spiritual light. The mahat-tattva is assembled in some
corner of the vast unlimited spiritual sky, and the part which is thus
covered by the mahat-tattva is called the material sky. This part of the


--- Page 141 ---
Text 2] Krsna Is the Source of All Incarnations 137
spiritual sky, called the mahat-tattva, is only an insignificant portion of the
whole spiritual sky, and within this mahat-tattva there are innumerable uni-
verses. All these universes are collectively produced by the Karanodakadayt
Visnu, called also the Maha-Visnu, who simply throws His glance to
impregnate the material sky.

. 2 part of the purusa lies down within the water of the universe, and
from the navel lake of His body sprouts a lotus stem, and from the lotus
flower atop this stem, Brahma, the master of all engineers in the universe,
becomes manifest.
PURPORT

The first purusa is the Karapodakasayi Visnu. From His skinholes
innumerable universes have sprung up. In each and every one of them the
purusa enters as the Garbhodakasayi Visnu. He is lying within half of the
universe which is full with the water of His body. And from the navel of
Garbhodakasayi Visnu has sprung up the stem of the lotus flower, the
birthplace of Brahma, who is the father of all living beings and the master
of all the demigod engineers engaged in the perfect design and working of
the universal order. Within the stem of the lotus there are fourteen
divisions of planetary systems, and the earthly planets are situated in the


--- Page 142 ---
138 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 3
middle. Upwards there are other, better planetary systems, and the top-
most system is called Brahmaloka or Satyaloka. Downwards from the
earthly planetary system there are seven downwards planetary systems
domiciled by the asuras and similar other materialistic living beings.

From this Garbhodakasayi Visnu there is expansion of the Ksirodakasayi
Visnu, who is the collective Paramatma of all living beings. He is called
Hari, and from Him all incarnations within the universe are expanded.

Therefore, the conclusion is that the purusa-cvatara is manifested in
three features, first the Karanodakasayi who creates aggregate material
ingredients in the mahat-tattva, second the Garbhodakasayt who enters
in each and every universe, and third the Ksirodakasayi Visnu who is the
Paramatma of every material object, organic or inorganic. One who knows
these plenary features of the Personality of Godhead knows also Him
(Godhead) properly, and thus the knower becomes freed from the material
conditions of birth, death, old age and disease, as it is confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita. In this loka the subject matter of Maha-Visnu is summa-
rized. The Maha-Visnu lies down in some part of the spiritual sky by His
own free will, and thus He lies on the ocean of kdrana from where He
glances over His material nature, and the mahat-tattva is at once created.
Thus electrified by the power of the Lord, the material nature creates at
once innumerable universes just as in due course a tree is decorated with
innumerable grown-up fruits. The seed of the tree is sown by the culti-
vator, and the tree or creeper in due course becomes manifested with so
many fruits. Nothing can take place without a cause. The Karana Ocean
is therefore called the Causal Ocean. Karana means causal. We should not
foolishly accept the atheistic theory of creation. The description of the
atheists is given in the Bhagavad-gita. The atheist does not believe in the
creator, but he cannot give a good theory to explain the creation. Material
nature has no power to create without the power of the purusa, just as a
prakrti or woman cannot produce a child without the connection of a
purusa. The purusa impregnates, and the prakrti delivers. We should not
expect milk from the fleshy bags on the neck of the goat, although they
look like breastly nipples. Similarly, we should not expect any creative
power from the material ingredients; we must believe in the power of the
purusa, who impregnates prakrti or nature. And because the Lord wished
to lie down in meditation, the material energy created innumerable
universes at once, and in each of them the Lord laid Himself down, and
thus all the planets and the different paraphernalia were created at once
by the will of the Lord. The Lord has unlimited potencies, and thus He
can perform as He likes by perfect planning, although personally He has

nothing to do, and no one is greater than or equal to Him. That is the
verdict of the Vedas.

TRANSLATION
It is believed that all the universal planetary systems are situated on
the extensive body of the purusa, but He has nothing to do with the
created material ingredients. His body is eternally in spiritual existence par
excellence.
PURPORT

The conception of the virata-riipa or visva-ripa of the Supreme Absolute
Truth is especially meant for the neophyte who can hardly think of the
transcendental form of the Personality of Godhead. To him a form means
something of this material world, and therefore an opposite conception of
the Absolute is necessary in the beginning to concentrate the mind on the
power extension of the Lord. As stated above, the Lord extends His
potency in the form of the mahat-tattva, which includes all material
ingredients. The extension of power by the Lord and the Lord Himself
personally are one in one sense, but at the same time the mahat-tattva is
different from the Lord. Therefore the potency of the Lord and the Lord
are simultaneously different and nondifferent. The conception of the
virata-riipa, especially for the impersonalist, is thus nondifferent from the
eternal form of the Lord. This eternal form of the Lord exists prior to the


--- Page 144 ---
140 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 3
creation of the mahat-tattva, and it is stressed here that the eternal form
of the Lord is par excellence spiritual or transcendental to the modes of
material nature. The very same transcendental form of the Lord is mani-
fested by His internal potency, and the formation of His multifarious
manifestations of incarnationsis always of the same transcendental quality,
without any touch of the mahat-tattva.

the purusa who has thousands of legs, thighs, arms and faces—all extraor-
dinary. In that body there are thousands of heads, ears, eyes and noses.
They are decorated with thousands of helmets and earrings and are
adorned with garlands.
PURPORT
With our present materialized senses we cannot perceive anything of the
transcendental Lord. Our present senses are to be rectified by the process
of devotional service, and then the Lord becomes Himself revealed to us.


--- Page 145 ---
Text 5] Krsna Is the Source of All Incarnations 141
In the Bhagavad-gita it is confirmed that the transcendental Lord can be
perceived only by pure devotional service. So it is confirmed in the Vedas
that devotional service can lead one to the side of the Lord, and devotional
service only can reveal Him. In the Brahma-sarihita also it is said that the
Lord is always visible to the devotees whose eyes have been anointed with
the tinge of devotional service. So we have to take information of the
transcendental form of the Lord from persons who have actually seen
Him with perfect eyes smeared with devotional service. In the material
world also we do not always see things with our own eyes, but through
the experience of those who have actually seen or done things. If that is
the process for experiencing a mundane object, it is more perfectly
applicable in matters transcendental. So with patience and perserverance
only we can realize the transcendental subject matter regarding the
Absolute Truth and His different forms. He is formless to the neophytes,
but He is in transcendental form to the expert servitor.

--- Page 146 ---
142 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 3
PURPORT

The purusa, after creating innumerable universes in the mahat-tattva,
enters in each of them as the second purusa, Garbhodakasayi Visnu. When
He saw that within the universe there is all darkness and space only
without a resting place, He filled up half of the universe with water out of
His own perspiration and laid Himself down on the same water. This water
is called Garbhodaka. Then from His navel the stem of the lotus flower
sprouted, and on the flower petals the birth of Brahma, or the master
engineer of the universal plan, took place. Brahma became the engineer of
the universe, and the Lord Himself took charge of the maintenance of the
universe as Vispu. Brahma is generated from rajo-gupa of prakrti, or the
mode of passion in nature, and Visnu became the Lord of the mode of
goodness. Visnu, being transcendental to all the modes, is always aloof
from the materialistic affection. This is already explained before. And
from Brahma there is Rudra (Siva), who is in charge of the modes of
ignorance or darkness. He destroys the whole creation by the will of the
Lord. Therefore all three, namely Brahma, Visnu and Siva, are incarnations
of the Garbhodakasayi Visnu. From Brahma the other demigods like
Daksa, Maricyadi, Manu and many others become incarnated to generate
living entities within the universe. This Garbhodakasayi Visnu is glorified
in the Vedas in the hymns of Garbha-stuti, which begin with the description
of the Lord as having thousands of heads, etc. The Garbhodakasayi Visnu
is the Lord of the universe, and although He appears to be lying within
the universe, He is always transcendental. This is also already explained.
Visnu, who is the plenary portion of the Garbhodakasayi Visnu, is the
Supersoul of the universal life, and He is known as the maintainer of the
universe or Ksirodakasayi Visnu. So the three features of the original
Purusa are thus understood. And all the incarnations within the universe
are emanations from this Ksirodakasayi Visnu.

In different millennia there are different incarnations, and they are
innumerable, although some of them are very prominent, such as Matsya,
Kiirma, Varaha, Rama, Nrsimhha, Vimana and many others. These incarna-
tions are called lila incarnations. Then there are qualitative incarnations
such as Brahmi, Visnu, and Siva or Rudra who take charge of the
different modes of material nature.

Lord Visnu is nondifferent from the Personality of Godhead. Lord Siva
is in the marginal position between the Personality of Godhead and the
living entities or jivas. Brahma is always a jiva-tattva. The highest pious
living being or the greatest devotee of the Lord is empowered with the


--- Page 147 ---
Text 5] Krsna Is the Source of All Incarnations 143
potency of the Lord for creation, and he is called Brahma. His power is like
the power of the sun reflected in valuable stones and jewels. When there is
no such living being to take charge of the post of Brahma, the Lord Him-
self becomes a Brahma and takes charge of the post.

Lord Siva is not an ordinary living being. He is the plenary portion of
the Lord, but because Lord Siva is in direct touch with material nature, he
is not exactly in the same transcendental position as Lord Visnu. The
difference is like that between milk and curd. Curd is nothing but milk,
and yet it cannot be used in place of milk.

The next incarnations are the Manus. Within one day’s duration of the
life of Brahma (which is calculated by our solar year as 4,300,000 x 1,000
years) there are fourteen Manus. Therefore there are 420 Manus in one
month of Brahma and 5,040 Manus in one year of Brahma. Brahma lives
for one hundred years of his age, and therefore there are 5,040 x 100 or
504,000 Manus in the duration of Brahma’s life. There are innumerable
universes with one Brahma in each of them, and all of them are created
and annihilated during the breathing time of the purusa. Therefore one
can simply imagine how many millions of Manus there are during one
breath of the purusa.

The Manus who are prominent within this universe are as follows:
Yajiia as Svayambhuva Manu, Vibhu as Svarocisa Manu, Satyasena as
Uttama Manu, Hari as Tamasa Manu, Vaikuntha as Raivata Manu, Ajita as
Ciksusa Manu, Vamana as Vaivasvata Manu (the present age is under the
Vaivasvata Manu), Sarvabhauma as Savarni Manu, Rsabha as Daksasavarni
Manu, Visvaksena as Brahmasavarni Manu, Dharmasetu as Dharmasavarni
Manu, Sudhama as Rudrasavarni Manu, Yogeévara as Devasavarni Manu,
and Brhadbhanu as Indra-savarni Manu. These are the names of one set of
fourteen Manus covering 4,300,000,000 solar years as described above.

Then there are the yugavataras or the incarnations of the millennia.
The yugas are known as Satya-yuga, Treta-yuga, Dvapara-yuga and Kali-
yuga. The incarnations of each yuga are of different color. The colors are
white, red, black and yellow. In the Dvapara-yuga, Lord Krsna in black
color appeared, and in the Kali-yuga Lord Caitanya in yellow color
appeared.

So all the incarnations of the Lord are mentioned in the revealed
scriptures. There is no scope for an imposter to become an incarnation,
for he must be mentioned in the $astras. An incarnation does not declare
Himself to be an incarnation of the Lord, but great sages agree by the
symptoms mentioned in the revealed scriptures. The features of the
incarnation and the particular type of mission which He has to execute


--- Page 148 ---
144 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 3
are mentioned in the revealed scriptures.

Apart from the direct incarnations, there are innumerable empowered
incarnations. They are also mentioned in the revealed scriptures. Such
incarnations are directly as well as indirectly empowered. When they are
directly empowered they are called incarnations, but when they are in-
directly empowered they are called vibhitis. Directly empowered incar-
nations are the Kumaras, Narada, Prthu, Sesa, Ananta, etc. As far as
vibhiitis are concerned, they are very explicitly described in the Bhagavad-
878৫ in the Vibhiiti-yoga chapter. And for all these different types of
incarnations, the fountainhead is the Garbhodakasayi Visnu.

TRANSLATION
First of all, in the beginning of creation, there were the four unmarried
sons of Brahma [the Kumaras], who, being situated in a vow of celibacy,
underwent severe austerities for realization of the Absolute Truth.
PURPORT

The creation of the material world is effected, maintained and then
again annihilated at certain intervals. So there are different names of the
creations in terms of the particular types of Brahma, the father of the
living beings in the creation. These Kumaras, as above-mentioned, appeared
in the kaumadra creation of the material world, and to teach us the process


--- Page 149 ---
Text 7] Krsna Is the Source of All Incarnations 145
of Brahman realization, they underwent a severe type of disciplinary action
as bachelors. These Kumaras are empowered incarnations. And before
executing the severe type of disciplinary actions, all of them became
qualified brahmanas. This example suggests that one must first acquire the
qualifications of a brahmana, not simply by birth but also by quality, and
then one can undergo the process 01 Brahman realization.

TRANSLATION
The supreme enjoyer of all sacrifices accepted the incarnation of a
boar [the second incarnation], and for the welfare of the earth He lifted
the earth up from the nether regions of the universe. £
PURPORT

The indication is that for each and every incarnation of the Personality
of Godhead, the particular function executed is also mentioned. There
cannot be any incarnation without a particular function, and such functions
are always extraordinary. They are impossible for any living being to
perform. The incarnation of the boar was to take the earth out of Pluto’s
region of filthy matter. Picking up something from a filthy place is done
by a boar, and the all-powerful Personality of Godhead displayed this
wonder to the asuras, who hid the earth in such a filthy place. There is
nothing impossible for Him, and although the Personality of Godhead
played the part of a boar, still by the devotees He is worshiped, staying
always in transcendence.

TRANSLATION
In the millennium of the rsis, the Personality of Godhead accepted the
third empowered incarnation in the form of Devarsi Narada, who is a great
sage among the demigods. He collected expositions of the Vedas which
deal with devotional service and which inspire nonfruitive action.
PURPORT
The great Rsi Narada, who is an empowered incarnation of the Person-
ality of Godhead, propagates devotional service all over the universe. All
great devotees of the Lord all over the universe and in different planets
and species of life are his disciples. Srila Vyasadeva, the compiler of the
Srimad-Bhagavatam, is also one of his disciples. He is the author of
Narada-paficaratra, which is the exposition of the Vedas, particularly for
devotional service of the Lord. This Narada-paiicaratra trains the karmis
or the fruitive workers to achieve liberation from the bondage of fruitive
work. The conditioned souls are mostly attracted by fruitive work because
they want to enjoy life by the sweat of their own brow. The whole
universe is full of fruitive workers in all species of life. The fruitive works
include all kinds of economic development plans. But the law of nature
provides that every action has its resultant reaction, and the performer of
the work is bound up by such reactions, good or bad. The reaction of good
work is comparative material prosperity, whereas the reaction of bad work


--- Page 151 ---
Text 9] Krsna Is the Source of All Incarnations 147
is comparative material distress. But material conditions, either in so-called
happiness or in so-called distress, are all meant ultimately for distress only.
Foolish materialists have no information how to obtain eternal happiness
in the unconditional state. Sri Narada informs these foolish fruitive
workers how to realize the reality of happiness. He gives direction to the
diseased men of the world how one’s present engagement can lead one to
the path of spiritual emancipation. The physician gives direction to the
patient to take treated milk in the form of curd for his sufferings from
indigestion due to his taking another milk preparation. So the cause of the
disease and the remedy of the disease may be the same, but it must be
treated by an expert physician like Narada. The Bhagavad-gita also gives
the same solution for serving the Lord by the fruits of one’s labor. That
will lead one to the path of naiskarmya, or liberation.

acceptance of penance for realization of the transcendence, is the only
duty of the human being; it was so done by the Lord Himself in an

examplary manner to teach us. The Lord is very kind to the forgetful
souls. He therefore comes Himself and leaves behind necessary instructions
and also sends His good sons as representatives to call all the conditioned
souls back to Godhead. Recently, within the memory of everyone, Lord
Caitanya also appeared for the same purpose: to show special favor to
fallen souls of this age of iron industry. The incarnation of Narayana is
worshiped still at Badarinarayana, on the range of the Himalayas.

every one of them are explicitly explained in the system of Sankhya
philosophy. Sankhya philosophy is generally called metaphysics by the
European scholars. The etymological meaning of sditkhya is that which
explains very lucidly by analysis of the material elements. This was done
for the first time by Lord Kapila, who is said herein to be the fifth in the
line of incarnations.

Lord is mentioned in the Brahmanda Purana in connection with the story
of the devoted wife. It is said there that Anasiiya, the wife of Rsi Atri,
prayed before the Lords Brahma, Vispu and Siva as follows: “My lords, if
you are pleased with me, and if you desire me to ask from you some sort
of blessings, then I pray that you combine together to become my son.”
This was accepted by the lords, and as Dattatreya the Lord expounded the
philosophy of the spirit soul and especially instructed Alarka, Prahlada,
Yadu, Haihaya, etc.

The seventh incarnation was 1303, the son of Prajapati Ruci and his
wife Akiti. He controlled the period during the change of the Svayambhuva
Manu and was assisted by demigods such as His son Yama and others.
PURPORT
The administrative posts occupied by the demigods for maintaining the
regulations of the material world are offered to the highly elevated pious
living beings. When there is a scarcity of such pious living beings, the Lord
incarnates Himself as Brahma, Prajapati, Indra, etc., and takes up the
charge. During the period of Svayambhuva Manu (the present period is of
Vaivasvata Manu) there was no suitable living being who could occupy
the post of Indra, the King of the Indraloka (heaven) planet. The Lord
Himself at that time became Indra. Assisted by His own sons like Yama
and other demigods, Lord Yajiia ruled the administration of the universal
affairs.

TRANSLATION
The eighth incarnation was King Rsabha, son of King Nabhi and his
wife Merudevi. In this incarnation the Lord showed the path of perfection,
which is followed by those who have fully controlled their senses and who
are honored by all orders of life.
PURPORT
The society of human beings is naturally divided into eight by orders
and statuses of life, the four divisions of occupation and four divisions of
cultural advancement. The intelligent class, the administrative class, the
productive class and the laborer class are the four divisions of occupation.
And the student life, the householder’s life, retired life and renounced
life are the four statuses of cultural advancement towards the path of
spiritual realization. Out of these, the renounced order of life, or the order
of sannyasa, is considered the highest of all, and a sannyasi is constitution-
ally the spiritual master for all the orders and divisions. In the sannyasa
order also there are four stages of upliftment toward perfection. Such
stages are called the kuticaka, bahudaka, parivrajakacarya, and the parama-
harisa. The paramaharisa stage of life is the highest stage of perfection.
This order of life is respected by all others. Maharaja Rsabha, the son of
King Nabhi and Merudevi, was an incarnation of the Lord, and He in-
structed His sons to follow the path of perfection by tapasya which
sanctifies one’s existence and enables one to attain the stage of spiritual
happiness which is eternal and ever increasing. Every living being is search-
ing after happiness, but no one knows where eternal and unlimited happi-
ness is obtainable. Foolish men seek after material sense pleasure as a
substitute for real happiness, but such foolish men forget that temporary
so-called happiness derived from sense pleasures is also enjoyed by the
dogs and hogs. No animal, bird or beast is bereft of this sense pleasure.
In every species of life, including the human form of life, such happiness
is immensely obtainable. The human form of life is, however, not meant
for such cheap happiness. The human life is meant for attaining eternal and
unlimited happiness by spiritual realization. This spiritual realization is
obtained by tapasya or undergoing voluntarily the path of penance and
abstinence from material pleasures. Those who have been trained for
abstinence in material pleasures are called dhira, or men undisturbed by
the senses. These dhiras can accept the orders of sannydsa, and they can
gradually rise up to the status of the paramahamsa, which is adored by all

members of the society. King Rsabha propagated this mission, and at the
last stage He became completely aloof from the material bodily needs,
which is a rare stage not to be imitated by foolish men, but to be wor-
shiped by all.

0 brahmanas, the ninth incarnation of the Lord, prayed for by sages,
was King Prthu, who cultivated the land to yield various produces, and for
that reason the earth was beautiful and attractive.
PURPORT
Before the advent of King Prthu, there was great havoc of maladministra-
tion due to the vicious life of the previous king, the father of Maharaja
Prthu. The intelligent class of men (namely the sages and the brahmanas)
not only prayed for the Lord to come down, but they also dethroned the
previous king. It is the duty of the king to be pious and thus look after the
all around welfare of the citizens. Whenever there is some negligence on
the part of the king in discharging his duty, the intelligent class of men
must dethrone him. The intelligent class of men, however, do not occupy
the royal throne because they have much more important duties for the
welfare of the public. Instead of occupying the royal throne, they prayed
for the incarnation of the Lord, and the Lord came as Maharaja Prthu.
Real intelligent men or qualified brahmanas never aspire for political

posts. Maharaja Prthu excavated many produces from the earth, and thus
not only the citizens became happy to have such a good king, but the
complete sight of the earth also became beautiful and attractive.

TRANSLATION
When there was a complete inundation after the period of the Caksusa
Manu and the whole world was deep within water, the Lord accepted the
form of a fish and protected Vaivasvata Manu, keeping him up on a boat.
PURPORT

According to Sripada Sridhara Svami, the original commentator on the
Bhagavata, there is not always a devastation after the change of every
Manu. And yet this inundation after the period of Ciksusa Manu took
place in order to show some wonders to Satyavrata. But Sri Jiva Gosvami
has given definite proofs from authoritative scriptures (like ककय
dharmottara, Markandeya Purana, Harivarisa, etc.) that there is always
a devastation after the end of each and every Manu. Srila Visvanatha
Cakravarti has also supported Srila Jiva Gosvami, and he (Sri Cakravarti)
has also quoted from Bhdgavatamrtam about this inundation after each
Manu. Apart from this, the Lord, in order to show special favor to
Satyavrata, a devotee of the Lord, in this particular period, incarnated
Himself.

PURPORT
Once both the atheists and the theists were engaged in producing nectar
from the sea so that all of them could become deathless by drinking it.
At that time the Mandaracalam Hill was used as the churning rod, and the
shell of Lord Tortoise, the incarnation of Godhead, became the resting
place (pivot) of the hill in the sea water.

planetary systems, He simply asked for a donation of three steps of land.

The Almighty God can bestow upon anyone the kingdom of the uni-
verse from a very small beginning, and similarly, He can take away the
kingdom of the universe on the plea of begging a small piece of land.

As Bhrgupati, the sixteenth incarnation of the Godhead, the Lord

angry with them because of their rebellion against the brihmanas [the
intelligent class].
PURPORT
The ksatriyas or the administrative class of men are expected to rule the
planet by the direction of the intelligent class of men who give direction
to the rulers in terms of the standard sastras or the books of revealed
knowledge. The rulers carry on the administration according to that direc-
tion. Whenever there is disobedience on the part of the ksatriyas or the
administrative class against the orders of the learned and intelligent
brahmanas, the administrators are removed by force from the posts, and
arrangement is made for better administration.

--- Page 162 ---
158 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 3
PURPORT
Originally the Veda is one. But Srila Vyasadeva divided the original
Veda into four, namely Sama, Yajus, Rk, Atharva, and then again they
were explained in different branches like the Puranas and the Mahabharata.
Vedic language and the subject matter are very difficult for ordinary men.
They are understood by the highly intelligent and self-realized brahmanas.
But the present age of Kali is full of ignorant men. Even those who are
born by a brahmana father are, in the present age, no better than the
sadras or the women. The twice-born men, namely the brahmanas,
ksatriyas and vaiSyas, are expected to undergo a cultural purificatory
process known as samskaras, but because of the bad influence of the
present age the so-called members of the brahmana and other high order
families are no longer highly cultured. They are called the dvija-bandhu or
the friends and family members of the twice-born. But these dvija-bandhus
are classified amongst the sadras and the women. Srila Vyasadeva divided
the Vedas in various branches and sub-branches for the sake of the less
intelligent classes like the dvija-bandhus, siidras and the women.

Text 23] Krsna Is the Source of All Incarnations 159
PURPORT

The Personality of Godhead Sri Rama assumed the form of a human
being and appeared on the earth for the purpose of doing some pleasing
work for the demigods or the administrative personalities to maintain the
order of the universe. Sometimes great demons and atheists like Ravana
and Hiranyakasipu and many others become very famous due to advancing
material civilization by the help of material science and other activities
with a spirit of challenging the established order of the Lord. For example.
the attempt to fly to other planets by material means is a challenge to the
established order. The conditions of each and every planet are different.
and different classes of human beings are accomodated there for particular
purposes mentioned in the codes of the Lord. But, puffed up by tiny
success in material advancement, sometimes the godless materialist chal-
lenges the existence of God. Ravana was one of them, and he wanted to
deport ordinary men to the planets of Indra (heaven) by material means
without consideration of the necessary qualifications. He wanted a stair-
case to be built up directly reaching the heavenly planet so that people
might not be required to undergo the routine of pious work necessary to
enter that planet. He also wanted to perform other acts against the
established rule of the Lord. He even challenged the authority of Sr Rima
the Personality of Godhead and kidnapped His wife Sita. Of course Lord
Rama came to chastise this atheist, answering the prayer and desire of the
demigods. He therefore took up the challenge of Ravana, and the complete
activity is the subject matter of the Ramayana. Because Lord Ramacandra
was the Personality of Godhead, He exhibited superhuman activities which
no human being, including the materially advanced Ravana, could perform.
Lord Ramacandra prepared a royal road on the Indian Ocean with stones
that floated on the water. The modern scientists have done research in the
area of weightlessness, but it is not possible to bring in weightlessness any-
where and everywhere. But because weightlessness is the creation of the
Lord by which He can make the gigantic planets fly and float in the air, He
made the stones even within this earth to be weightless and prepared a
stone bridge on the sea without any supporting pillar. That is the display
of the power of God.

The specific mention of the word bhagavan in this text indicates that
Balarama and Krsna are original forms of the Lord. This will be further
explained later. Lord Krsna is not an incarnation of the purusa as we
learned from the beginning of this chapter. He is directly the original
Personality of Godhead, and Balarama is the first plenary manifestation
of the Lord. From Baladeva the first phalanx of plenary expansions,
Vasudeva, Saikarsana, Aniruddha and Pradyumna, expands. Lord Sri
Krsna is Vasudeva, and Baladeva is Sankarsana.

TRANSLATION

Then, in the beginning of Kali-yuga, the Lord will appear as Lord
Buddha, the son of Afijana, in the province of Gaya, just for the purpose
of deluding those who are envious of the faithful theist.

PURPORT

Lord Buddha, a powerful incarnation of the Personality of Godhead,
appeared in the province of Gaya (Bihar) as the son of Afijana, and he
preached his own conception of nonviolence and deprecated even the
animal sacrifices sanctioned in the Vedas. At the time when Lord Buddha
appeared, the people in general were atheistic and preferred animal flesh
to anythingelse. On the plea of Vedic sacrifice, every place was practically
turned into a slaughterhouse, and animal killing was indulged in unrestrict-
edly. Lord Buddha preached nonviolence, taking pity on the poor animals.
He preached that he did not believe in the tenets of the Vedas and stressed
the adverse psychological effects incurred by animal killing. Less intelligent
men of the age of Kali, who had no faith in God, followed his principle,
and for the time being they were trained in moral discipline and nonvio-
lence, the preliminary steps for proceeding further on the path of God
realization. He deluded the atheists because such atheists who followed his
principles did not believe in God, but they kept their absolute faith in
Lord Buddha who himself was the incarnation of God. Thus the faithless
people were made to believe in God in the form of Lord Buddha. That was
the mercy of Lord Buddha: He made the faithless faithful to him.

Killing of animals before the advent of Lord Buddha was the most
prominent feature of the society. They claimed that these were Vedic
sacrifices. When the Vedas are not accepted through the authoritative
disciplic succession, the casual readers of the Vedas are misled by the
flowery language of that system of knowledge. In the Bhagavad-gita a
comment has been made on such foolish scholars. The foolish scholars of
Vedic literature who do not care to receive the transcendental message
through the transcendental realized sources of disciplic succession are sure
to be bewildered. To them, the ritualistic ceremonies are considered to be
all in all. They have no depth of knowledge, according to the Bhagavad-
8. The whole system of the Vedas is to lead one gradually to the path of


--- Page 166 ---
162 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 3
the Supreme Lord. The whole theme of Vedic literature is to know the
Supreme Lord, the individual soul, the cosmic situation and the relations
between all these items. When the relation is known, the relative function
begins, and as a result of such a function the ultimate goal of life or going
back to Godhead takes place in the easiest manner. Unfortunately, un-
authorized scholars of the Vedas become captivated by the purificatory
ceremonies only, and natural progress is checked thereby.

To such bewildered persons of atheistic propensity, Lord Buddha is the
emblem of theism. He therefore first of all wanted to check the habit of
animal killing. The animal killers are dangerous elements on the path of
going back to Godhead. There are two types of animal killers. The soul is
also sometimes called the “animal” or the living being. Therefore, both
the slaughterer of animals as well as those who have lost their identity of
soul are animal killers.

Maharaja Pariksit said that only the animal killer cannot relish the
transcendental message of the Supreme Lord. Therefore if people are to
be educated to the path of Godhead they must be taught first and foremost
to stop the process of animal killing as above mentioned. It is nonsensical
to say that animal killing has nothing to do with spiritual realization. By
this dangerous theory many so-called sannyasis have sprung up by the
grace of Kali-yuga who preach animal killing under the garb of the Vedas.
The subject matter has already been discussed in the conversation between
Lord Caitanya and Maulana Chand Kazi Shaheb. The animal sacrifice as
stated in the Vedas is different from the unrestricted animal killing in the
slaughterhouse. Because the asuras or the so-called scholars of Vedic
literatures put forward the evidence of animal killing in the Vedas, Lord
Buddha superficially denied the authority of the Vedas. This rejection of
the Vedas by Lord Buddha was adopted in order to save people from the
vice of animal killing as well as to save the poor animals from the
slaughtering process of their big brothers who clamor for universal brother-
hood, peace, justice and equity. There is no justice when there is animal
killing. Lord Buddha wanted to stop it completely, and therefore his cult
of ahirnsa was propagated not only in India but also outside the country.

Technically Lord Buddha’s philosophy is called atheistic because there
is no acceptance of the Supreme Lord and because that system of philoso-
phy denied the authority of the Vedas. But that is an act of camouflage
by the Lord. Lord Buddha is the incarnation of Godhead. As such, he is
the original propounder of Vedic knowledge. He therefore cannot reject
Vedic philosophy. But he rejected it outwardly because the sura-dvisa, or
the demons who are always envious of the devotees of Godhead, try to


--- Page 167 ---
Text 25] Krsna Is the Source of All Incarnations 163
support cow killing or animal killing from the pages of the Vedas, and this
is now being done by the modernized sannydsis. Lord Buddha had to
reject the authority of the Vedas altogether. This is simply technical, and
had it not been so he would not have been so accepted as the incarnation
of Godhead. Neither would he have been worshiped in the transcendental
songs of the poet Jayadeva, who is a Vaisnava dcarya. He preached the pre-
liminary principles of the Vedas in a manner suitable for the time being
(and so also did Acarya Sankaracirya) to establish the authority of the
Vedas. Therefore both Lord Buddha and Acarya Sarikara paved the path
of theism, and Vaisnava dcaryas, specifically Lord Sri Caitanya Maha-
prabhu, led the people on the path towards a realization of going back to
Godhead.

We are glad that people are taking interest in the nonviolent movement
of Lord Buddha. But will they take the matter very seriously and close the
animal slaughterhouses altogether? If not, there is no meaning to the
ahirnsa cult.

Srimad-Bhagavatam was composed just prior to the beginning of the
age of Kali (about five thousand years ago), and Lord Buddha appeared
about 2,600 years ago. Therefore in the Srimad-Bhagavatam Lord Buddha is
foretold. Such is the authority of this clear scripture. There are many such
prophecies, and they are bette fulfilled one after another. They will in-
dicate the positive standing of Srimad-Bhagavatam, which is without trace
of mistake, illusion, cheating and imperfection, which are the four flaws
of all conditioned souls. The liberated souls are above these flaws; there-
fore they can see and foretell things which are to take place on distant
future dates.

Thereafter, at the conjunction of two yugas, the Lord of the creation
will take His birth as the Kalki incarnation and become the son of Visnu
Yasa. At this time the rulers of the earth will have degenerated into
plunderers.
PURPORT
Here is another foretelling of the advent of Lord Kalki, the incarnation
of Godhead. He is to appear at the conjunction of the two yugas, namely
at the end of Kali-yuga and the beginning of Satya-yuga. The cycle of the
four yugas, namely Satya, Treta, Dvapara and Kali, rotates like the
calendar months. The present Kali-yuga lasts 432,000 years, out of which
we have passed only 5,000 years after the Battle of Kuruksetra and the
end of the regime of King Parksit. So there are 427,000 years balance yet
to be finished. Therefore at the end of this period, the incarnation of Kalki
will take place, as foretold in the S$rimad-Bhagavatam. His father’s name,
Visnu Yasa, a learned brihmapa, and the village Sambhal are also men-
tioned. As above mentioned, all these foretellings will prove to be factual
in chronological order. That is the authority of $rimad-Bhagavatam.

PURPORT

The list of incarnations of the Personality of Godhead given herein is
not complete. It is only a partial view of all the incarnations. There are
many others, such as Sri Hayagriva, Hari, Hamsa, Prénigarbha, Vibhu,
Satyasena, Vaikuntha, Sarvabhauma, Viévaksena, Dharmasetu, Sudhama,
Yogesévara, Brhadbhinu, etc., in the bygone ages. Sri Prahlada Maharaja
said in his prayer, “My Lord, You manifest in as many incarnations as
there are species of life, namely the aquatics, the vegetables, the reptiles,
the birds, the beasts, the men, the demigods, etc., just for the maintenance
of the faithful and the annihilation of the unfaithful. You advent Yourself
in this way in accordance with the necessity of the different yugas. In the
Kali-yuga You have incarnated garbed as a devotee.” This incarnation of
the Lord in the Kali-yuga is Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu. There are many
other places, both in the Bhagavatam and other scriptures, in which the
incarnation of the Lord as Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is explicitly men-
tioned. In the Brahma-samhita also it is said indirectly that although there
are many incarnations of the Lord, such as Rama, Nrsimha, Varaha, Matsya,
Karma and many others, the Lord Himself sometimes incarnates in person.
Lord Krsna and Lord इनं Caitanya Mahaprabhu are not, therefore, incar-
nations, but the original source of all other incarnations. This will be
clearly explained in the next 81010. So the Lord is the inexhaustible source
for innumerable incarnations which are not always mentioned. But such
incarnations are distinguished by specific extraordinary feats which are
impossible to be performed by any living being. That is the general test to
identify an incarnation of the Lord directly and indirectly empowered.
Some incarnations mentioned above are almost plenary portions. For in-
stance, the Kumaras are empowered with transcendental knowledge. Sri
Narada is empowered with devotional service. Maharaja Prthu is an em-
powered incarnation with executive function. The Matsya incarnation is
directly a plenary portion. So the innumerable incarnations of the Lord are
manifested all over the universes constantly without cessation, as water
flows constantly from waterfalls.

original Personality of Godhead. All of them appear on planets whenever
there is a disturbance created by the atheists. The Lord incarnates to
protect the theists.

PURPORT

In this particular stanza Lord Sri Krsna the Personality of Godhead is
distinguished from other incarnations. He is counted amongst the avataras
(incarnations) because out of His causeless mercy the Lord descends from
His transcendental abode. Avatara means one who descends. All the incar-
nations of the Lord, including the Lord Himself, descend on the different
planets of the material world as also in different species of life to fulfill
particular missions. Sometimes He comes Himself, and sometimes His dif-
ferent plenary portions or parts of the plenary portions or His differen-
tiated portions directly or indirectly empowered by Him descend on this
material world to execute certain specific functions. Originally the Lord is
full of all opulences, all prowess, all fames, all beauties, all knowledge and
all renunciations. When they are partly manifested through the plenary
portions or parts of the plenary portions, it should be noted that certain
manifestations of His different powers are required for those particular
functions. When in the room small electric bulbs are displayed, it does not
mean that the electric powerhouse is limited by the small bulbs. The same
powerhouse can supply power to operate large-scale industrial dynamos
with greater volts. Similarly, the incarnations of the Lord display limited
powersbecause so much power is needed at that particular time.

For example, Lord Parasurima and Lord Nrsimha displayed unusual
opulence by killing the disobedient ksatriyas twenty-one times and killing
the greatly powerful atheist Hiranyakasipu. Hiranyakasipu was so powerful
that even the demigods in other planets would tremble simply by the
unfavorable raising of his eyebrow. The demigods in the higher level of
material existence many, many times excel the most well-to-do human
beings, in duration of life, beauty, wealth, paraphernalia, and in all other
respects. Still they were afraid of Hiranyaka$ipu. Thus we can simply
imagine how powerful Hiranyaka$ipu was in this material world. But even
Hiranyakasipu was cut into small pieces by the nails of Lord Nrsirha.
This means that anyone materially powerful cannot stand the strength
of the Lord’s nails. Similarly, Jamadagnya displayed the Lord’s power to
kill all the disobedient kings powerfully situated in their respective states.
His empowered incarnation, Narada, and plenary incarnation, Varadha, as


--- Page 172 ---
168 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 3
well as indirectly empowered Lord Buddha, created faith in the mass of
people. The incarnations of Rama and Dhanvantari displayed His fame,
and Balarama, Mohin1 and Vimana exhibited His beauty. Dattatreya,
Matsya, Kumara and Kapila exhibited His transcendental knowledge. Nara
and Narayana Rsis exhibited His renunciation. So all the different incar-
nations of the Lord indirectly or directly manifested different features,
but Lord Krsna, the primeval Lord, exhibited the complete features of
Godhead, and thus it is confirmed that He is the source of all other incar-
nations. And the most extraordinary feature exhibited by Lord Sri Krsna
was His internal energetic manifestation of His pastimes with the cowherd
girls. His pastimes with the gopis are all displays of transcendental exist-
ence, bliss and knowledge, although these are manifested apparently as
sex love. The specific attraction of His pastimes with the gopis should
never be misunderstood. The Bhagavatam relates these transcendental
pastimes in the Tenth Canto. And in order to reach the position to under-
stand the transcendental nature of Lord Krsna’s pastimes with the gopis,
the Bhagavatam promotes the student gradually in nine other cantos.

According to dm Jiva Gosvam1’s statement, in accordance with authori-
tative sources, Lord Krsna is the source of all other incarnations. It is not
that Lord Krsna has any source of incarnation. All the symptoms of the
Supreme Truth in full are present in the person of Lord Sri Krsna, and in
the Bhagavad-gita the Lord emphatically declares that there is no truth
greater than or equal to Himself. In this stanza the word svayam is
particularly mentioned to confirm that Lord Krsna has no other source
than Himself. Although in other places the incarnations are described as
bhagavan, because of their specific functions, still nowhere are they
declared to be the Supreme Personality. In this stanza the word svayam
signifies the supremacy as the summum bonum.

The summum bonum Krsna is one without a second. He Himself has
expanded Himself in various parts, portions and particles as svayam-riipa,
svayam-prakasa, tadekatma, prabhava, vaibhava, vilasa, avatara, avesa, and
jivas, all provided with innumerable energies just suitable to the respective
persons and personalities. Learned scholars in transcendental subjects have
carefully analyzed the summum bonum Krsna to have sixty-four principal
attributes. All the expansions or categories of the Lord possess only some
percentages of these attributes. But Sri Krsna is the possessor of the attri-
butes cent percent. And His personal expansions such as svayam-prakasa,
tadekatma up to the categories of the avataras, who are all Vispu-tattva,
possess up to ninety-three percent of these transcendental attributes. Lord
Siva, who is neither avatdra nor avesa nor in between them, possesses


--- Page 173 ---
Text 29] Krsna Is the Source of All Incarnations 169
almost eighty-four percent of the attributes. But the jivas or the individual
living beings in different statuses of life possess up to the limit of seventy-
eight percent of the attributes. In the conditioned state of material exis-
tence, the living being possesses these attributes in very minute quantity,
varying in terms of the pious life of the living being. The most perfect of
living beings is Brahma, the supreme administrator of one universe. He
possesses seventy-eight percent of the attributes in full. All other demigods
have the same attributes in less quantity, whereas human beings possess
the attributes in very minute quantity. The standard of perfection for a
human being is to develop the attributes up to seventy-eight percent in
full. The living being can never possess attributes like Siva, Visnu or Lord
Krsna. A living being can become godly by developing the seventy-eight
percent transcendental attributes in fullness, but he can never become a
God like Siva, Visnu or Krsna. He can become a Brahma in due course. The
godly living beings who are all residents of the planets in the spiritual sky
are eternal associates of God in different spiritual planets called Hari-dhama
and Mahesa-dhama. The abode of Lord Krsna above all spiritual planets is
called Krsnaloka or Goloka Vrndavana, and the perfected living being by
developing seventy-eight percent of the above attributes in fullness can
enter the planet of Krsnaloka after leaving the present material body.

PURPORT
In the Bhagavad-gita the Personality of Godhead has declared that
anyone who knows the principles of the transcendental birth and activities
of the Lord will go back to Godhead after being relieved from this material
tabernacle. So simply knowing factually the mysterious way of the Lord’s
incarnation in this material world can liberate one from material bondage.
Therefore the birth and activities of the Lord, as manifested by Him for
the welfare of the people in general, are not ordinary. They are mysterious,
and only by those who carefully try to go deep into the matter by spiritual
devotion is the mystery discovered. Thus one gets liberation from the
material bondage. It is advised therefore that one who simply recites this
chapter of Bhagavatam, describing the appearance of the Lord in different
incarnations, in sincerity and devotion, can have insight into such birth
and activities of the Lord. The very word vimukti, or liberation, indicates
that the Lord’s birth and activities are all transcendental; otherwise simply
by reciting them one could not attain liberation. They are therefore
mysterious, and those who do not follow the prescribed regulations of
devotional service are not entitled to enter into the mysteries of His
births and activities.

neophytes] to adjust to the idea of the Lord having form. But factually
the Lord has no material form.
PURPORT

The conception of the Lord known as the visva-riipa or the virata-riipa
is particularly not mentioned along with the. various incarnations of the
Lord because all the incarnations of the Lord above mentioned are
transcendental, and there is not a tinge of materialism in their bodies.
There is no difference between the body and self as there is in the con-
ditioned soul. The virdta-riipa is conceived for those who are just neophyte
worshipers. For them the material virata-riipa is presented, and it will be
explained in the Second Canto. In the virata-riipa the material manifesta-
tions of different planets have been conceived as His legs, hands, etc.
Actually all such descriptions are for the neophytes. The neophytes cannot
conceive anything beyond matter. The material conception of the Lord is
not counted in the list of His factual forms. As Paramatma or Supersoul,
the Lord is within each and every material form, even within the atoms,
but the outward material form is but an imagination, both for the Lord
and the living being. The present forms of the conditioned souls are also
not factual. The conclusion is that the material conception of the body of
the Lord as virata is imaginary. Both the Lord and the living beings are
living spirits and have original spiritual bodies respectively.

TRANSLATION
Clouds and dust are carried by the air, but less intelligent persons say
that the sky is cloudy and the air is dirty. Similarly, they also implant

material bodily conceptions on the spirit self.

PURPORT
It is further confirmed herein that with our material eyes and senses we
cannot see the Lord, who is all spirit. We cannot even detect the spiritual
spark which exists within the material body of the living being. We look to
the outward covering of the body or subtle mind of the living being, but
we cannot see the spiritual spark within the body. So we have to accept
the living being’s presence by the presence of his gross body. Similarly,
those who want to see the Lord with their present material eyes or with
the material senses are advised to meditate on the gigantic external feature
called the virata-riipa. For instance, when a particular gentleman goes in
his car, which can be seen very easily, we identify the car with the man
within the car. When the President goes out in his particular car, we say,
“There is the President.” For the time being we identify the car with the
President. Similarly, less intelligent men who want to see God immediately
without necessary qualification are shown first the gigantic material
cosmos as the form of the Lord, although the Lord is within and without.
The clouds in the sky and the blue of the sky are better appreciated in this
connection. Although the bluish tint of the sky and the sky are different,
still we conceive of the color of the sky as blue. But that is a general
conception for the laymen only.

TRANSLATION |
Beyond this gross conception of form there is another subtle concep-
tion of form which is without formal shape and is unseen, unheard and
unmanifest. The living being has his form beyond this subtlety, otherwise
he could not have repeated births.
PURPORT

As the gross cosmic manifestation is conceived as the gigantic body of
the Lord, so also there is the conception of His subtle form, which is
simply realized without being seen, heard or manifested. But in fact all
these gross or subtle conceptions of the body are in relation with the living
beings. The living being has his spiritual form beyond this gross material or
subtle psychic existence. The gross body and psychic functions cease to
act as soon as the living being leaves the visible gross body. In fact, we say
that the living being has gone away because he is unseen and unheard. Even
when the gross body is not acting when the living being is in sound sleep,
we know that he is within the body by his breathing. So the living being’s
passing away from the body does not mean that there is no existence of
the living soul. It is there, otherwise how can he repeat his births again
and again?

The conclusion is that the Lord is eternally existent in His transcendental
form, which is neither gross nor subtle like that of the living being; His
body is never to be compared to the gross and subtle bodies of the living
being. All such conceptions of God’s body are imaginary. The living being
has his eternal spiritual form, which is conditioned only by his material
contamination.

TRANSLATION
Whenever a person experiences, by self-realization, that both the gross
and subtle bodies have nothing to do with the pure self, at that time he
sees himself as well as the Lord.
PURPORT

The difference between self-realization and material illusion is to know
that the temporary or illusory impositions of material energy in the shape
of gross and subtle bodies are superficial coverings of the self. The cover-
ings take place due to ignorance. Such coverings are never effective in the
person of the Personality of Godhead. Knowing this convincingly is called
liberation, or seeing the Absolute. This means that perfect self-realization
is made possible by adoption of godly or spiritual life. Self-realization
means to become indifferent to the needs of the gross and subtle bodies
and to become serious about the activities of the self. The impetus for
activities is generated from the self, but such activities become illusory
due to ignorance of the real position of the self. By ignorance, self-interest
is calculated in terms of the gross and subtle bodies, and therefore a whole
set of activities is spoiled life after life. When, however, one meets the self
by proper culture, the activities of the self begin. Therefore a man who is
engaged in the activities of the self is called jivanmufkta, or a liberated
person even in the conditional existence.

This perfect stage of self-realization is not attained by artificial means,
but under the lotus feet of the Lord, who is always transcendental. In the
Bhagavad-gita the Lord says that He is present in everyone’s heart, and
from Him only all knowledge, remembrance or forgetfulness take place.
When the living being desires to be an enjoyer of material energy (illusory
phenomena), the Lord covers the living being in the mystery of forgetful-
ness, and thus the living being misinterprets the gross body and subtle
mind to be his own self. And by culture of transcendental knowledge,
when the living being prays to the Lord for deliverance from the clutches
of forgetfulness, the Lord, by His causeless mercy, removes the living
being’s illusory curtain, and thus he realizes his own self. He then engages


--- Page 179 ---
Text 34] Krsna Is the Source of All Incarnations 175
himself in the service of the Lord in his eternal constitutional position,
becoming liberated from the conditioned life. Al this is executed by the
Lord through either His external potency or directly by the internal
potency.

TRANSLATION
If the illusory energy subsides and the living entity becomes fully
enriched with knowledge by the grace of the Lord, then he becomes at
once enlightened with self-realization and thus becomes situated in his
own glory.
PURPORT
Being part of the absolute transcendence, all the Lord’s forms, names,
pastimes, attributes, associates and energies are identical with Him. His
transcendental energy acts according to His omnipotency. The same energy
acts as His external, internal and marginal energies, and by His omnipoten-
cy He can perform anything and everything through the agency of any of
the above energies. He can turn the external energy into internal by His
will. Therefore by His grace the external energy, which is employed in
illusioning those living beings whe want to have it, subsides by the will of
the Lord in terms of repentance and penance for the conditioned soul.
And the very same energy then acts to help the purified living being make
progress on the path of self-realization. The example of electrical energy
is very appropriate in this connection. The expert electrician can utilize


--- Page 180 ---
176 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 3
the electrical energy for both heating and cooling by adjustment only.
Similarly, the external energy, which now bewilders the living being into
continuation of birth and death, is turned into internal potency by the
will of the Lord to lead the living being to eternal life. When a living being
is thus graced by the Lord, he is placed in his proper constitutional position
to enjoy eternal spiritual life.

Thus learned men describe the births and activities of the unborn and

PURPORT
Both the Lord and the living entities are essentially all spiritual. There-
fore both of them are eternal, and neither of them has birth and death.
The difference is that the so-called births and disappearances of the
Lord are unlike those of the living beings. The living beings who take
birth and then again accept death are bound by the laws of material
nature. But the so-called appearance and disappearance of the Lord
are not actions of material nature, but are demonstrations of the internal
potency of the Lord. They are described by the great sages for the
purpose of self-realization. It is stated in the Bhagavad-gita by the Lord
that His so-called birth in the material world and His activities are all
transcendental. And simply by meditation on such activities one can attain
realization of Brahman and thus become liberated from material bondage.
In the यऽ it is said that the birthless appears to take birth. The Supreme

has nothing to do, but because He is omnipotent, everything is performed
by Him naturally, as if done automatically. As a matter of fact, the
appearence and disappearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and
His different activities are all confidential, even to the Vedic literatures.
Yet they are displayed by the Lord to bestow mercy upon the conditioned
souls. We should always take advantage of the narrations of the activities
of the Lord, which are meditations on Brahman in the most convenient
and palatable form.

The prime difference between the Lord and the living entities is that
the Lord is the creator and the living entities are the created. Here He is

178 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 3
called the amogha-lilah, which indicates that there is nothing lamentable
in His creation. Those who create disturbance in His creation are them-
selves disturbed. He is transcendental to all material afflictions because
He is full with all six opulences, namely wealth, power, fame, beauty,
knowledge and renunciation, and thus He is the master of the senses. He
creates these manifested universes in order to reclaim the living beings who
are within them suffering threefold miseries, maintains them, and in due
course annihilates them without being the least affected by such actions.
He is connected with this material creation very superficially, as one
smells odor without being connected with the odorous article. Non-godly
elements therefore can never approach Him, despite all endeavours.

TRANSLATION
The foolish with poor fund of knowledge cannot know the transcen-
dental nature of the forms, names and activities of the Lord, who is playing
like an actor in a drama. Nor can they express such things, neither in their
speculations nor their writings.
PURPORT
No one can properly describe the transcendental nature of the Absolute
Truth. Therefore it is said that He is beyond the expression of mind and


--- Page 183 ---
Text 38] Krsna Is the Source of All Incarnations 179
speech. And yet there are some men, with poor fund of knowledge, who
desire to understand the Absolute Truth by imperfect mental speculation
and faulty description of His activities. To the layman His activities,
appearence and disappearance, His names, His forms, His paraphernalia,
His personalities and all things in relation with Him are mysterious acts.
There are two classes of materialists, namely the fruitive workers and the
empiric philosophers. The fruitive workers have practically no information
of the Absolute Truth, and the mental speculators, after being frustrated
in fruitive activities, turn their faces towards the Absolute Truth and try
to know Him by mental speculation. And for all these men, the Absolute
Truth is a mystery, as the jugglery of the magician is a mystery to children.
Being deceived by the jugglery of the Supreme Being, the nondevotees,
who may be very dexterous in fruitive work and mental speculation, are
always in ignorance. With such limited knowledge, they are unable to
penetrate into the mysterious region of transcendence. The mental specu-
lators are a little more progressive than the gross materialists or the fruitive
workers, but because they are also within the grip of illusion, they take it
for granted that anything which has form, a name and activities is but a
product of material energy. For them the Supreme Spirit is formless,
nameless and inactive. And because such mental speculators equalize the
transcendental name and form of the Lord with mundane names and form,
they are in fact in ignorance. With such a poor fund of knowledge, there
is no access to the real nature of the Supreme Being. As stated in Bhagavad-
९८, the Lord is always in a transcendental position, even when He is
within the material world. But ignorant men consider the Lord one of the
great personalities of the world, and thus they are misled by the illusory
energy.

powerful; ratha-anga-papeh—of Lord Krsna, who bears in His hand the

TRANSLATION
Only those who render unreserved, uninterrupted, favorable service
unto the lotus feet of Lord Krsna, who carries the wheel of the chariot
in His hand, can know the creator of the universe in His full glory, power
and transcendence.
PURPORT

Only the pure devotees can know the transcendental name, form and
activities of Lord Krsna due to their being completely freed from the re-
action of fruitive work and mental speculation. The pure devotees have
nothing to derive as personal profit from their unalloyed service to the
Lord. They render incessant service to the Lord spontaneously without
any reservation. Everyone within the creation of the Lord is rendering
service to the Lord indirectly or directly. No one is an exception to this
law of the Lord. Those who are rendering service indirectly, being forced
by the illusory agent of the Lord, are rendering service unto Him un-
favorably. But those who are rendering service unto Him directly under
the direction of His beloved agent are rendering service unto Him favor-
ably. Such favorable servitors are devotees of the Lord, and by the grace
of the Lord they can enter into the mysterious region of transcendence by
the mercy of the Lord. But the mental speculators remain in darkness all
the time. As stated in Bhagavad-gita, the Lord Himself guides the pure
devotees toward the path of realization due to their constant engagement
in the loving service of the Lord in spontaneous affection. That is the
secret of entering into the kingdom of God. Fruitive activities and specula-
tion are no qualifications for entering.

Only by making such inquiries in this world can one be successful and

unto the Personality of Godhead, who is the proprietor of all the universes,
and guarantee cent percent immunity from the dreadful repetition of birth
and death.
PURPORT
The inquiries of the sages headed by Saunaka are herewith praised by
518 Gosvami on the merit of their transcendental nature. As already con-
cluded, only the devotees of the Lord can know Him to a considerable
extent, and no one else can know Him at all, so the devotees are per-
fectly cognizant of all spiritual knowledge. The Personality of Godhead is
the last word in Absolute Truth. Impersonal Brahman and localized
Paramatma Supersoul are included in the knowledge of the Personality of
Godhead. So one who knows the Personality of Godhead can automati-
cally know all about Him, His multipotencies and expansions. So the
devotees are congratulated as being all successful. A cent percent devotee
of the Lord is immune to the dreadful material miseries of repeated birth
and death.

This Srimad-Bhagavatam is the literary incarnation of God, and it is
compiled by Srila Vyasadeva, the incarnation of God. It is meant for the
ultimate good of all people, and it is all-successful, all-blissful and all-
perfect.
PURPORT
Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu declared that Srimad-Bhagavatam is the
spotless sound representation of all Vedic knowledge and history. There
are selected histories of great devotees who are in direct contact with the
Personality of Godhead. Srimad-Bhagavatam is the literary incarnation of
Lord Sri Krsna and is therefore nondifferent from Him. $ rimad-Bhagavatam
should be worshiped as respectfully as we worship the Lord. Thereby we
can derive the ultimate blessings of the Lord through its careful and
patient study. As God is all light, all bliss and all perfection, so also is
Srimad-Bhagavatam. We can have all the transcendental light of the
Supreme Brahman Sti Krsna from the recitation of Srimad-Bhagavatam,
provided it is received through the medium of the transparent spiritual
master. Lord Caitanya’s private secretary Srila Svariipa Damodara Go-
svami advised all intending visitors who came to see the Lord at Puri to
make a study of the Bhdgavatam from the person Bhagavatam. Person
Bhagavatam is the self-realized bona fide spiritual master, and through
him only can one understand the lessons of Bhagavatam in order to receive
the desired result. One can derive from the study of the Bhagavatam all
benefits that are possible to be derived from the personal presence of the

Lord. It carries with it all the transcendental blessings of Lord इत Krsna
that we can expect from His personal contact.

TRANSLATION
Sti Vyasadeva delivered it to his son, who is the most respected among
the self-realized, after extracting the cream of all Vedic literatures and
histories of the universe.
PURPORT
Men with a poor fund of knowledge only accept the history of the world
from the time of Buddha, or since 600 B.C., and prior to this period all
histories mentioned in the scriptures are calculated by them to be only
imaginary stories. That is not a fact. All the stories mentioned in the
Puranas and Mahabharata, etc., are actual histories, not only of this planet
but also of millions of other planets within the universe. Sometimes the
history of planets beyond this world appear to such men to be unbeliev-
able. But they do not know that different planets are not equal in all
respects and that therefore some of the historical facts derived from other
planets do not correspond with the experience of this planet. Considering
the different situation of different planets and also time and circumstances,
there is nothing wonderful in the stories of the Puranas, nor are they
imaginary. We should always remember the maxim that one man’s food
is another man’s poison. We should not, therefore, reject the stories and


--- Page 188 ---
184 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 3
histories of the Purapas as imaginary. The great rsis like Vyasa had no
business putting some imaginary stories in their literatures.

In the Srimad-Bhagavatam historical facts selected from the histories of
different planets have been depicted. It is therefore accepted by all the
spiritual authorities as the Mahapurana. The special significance of these
histories is that they are all connected with activities of the Lord in a
different time and atmosphere. Srila Sukadeva Gosvami is the topmost
personality of all the self-realized souls, and he accepted this as the sub-
ject of studies from his father Vyasadeva. Srila Vyasadeva is the great
authority, and the subject matter of Srimad-Bhdagavatam being so impor-
tant, he delivered the message first to his great son Srila Sukadeva Go-
svami. It is compared to the cream of the milk. Vedic literature is like the
milk ocean of knowledge. Cream or butter is the most palatable essence of
milk, and so also is Srimad-Bhagavatam, for it contains all palatable, in-
structive and authentic versions of different activities of the Lord and His
devotees. There is no gain, however, in accepting the message of Bhagava-
tam from the unbelievers, atheists and professional reciters who make a
trade of Bhagavatam for the laymen. It was delivered to Srila Sukadeva
Gosvami, and he had nothing to do with the Bhagavata business. He did
not have to maintain family expenses by such trade. Srimad-Bhagavatam
should therefore be received from the representative of Sukadeva, who
must be in the renounced order of life without family encumbrance. Milk
is undoubtedly very good and nourishing, but when it is touched by the
mouth of a snake it is no longer nourishing; rather, it becomes a source of
death. Similarly, those who are not strictly in the Vaisnava discipline
should not make a business of this Bhagavataand become a cause of
spiritual death for so many hearers. In the Bhagavad-gita the Lord says
that the purpose of all the Vedas is to know Him (Lord Krsna), and
Srimad-Bhagavatam is Lord Sri Krsna Himself in the form of recorded
knowledge. Therefore, it is the cream of all the Vedas, and it contains all
historical facts of all times in relation with इन Krsna. It is factually the
essence of all histories.

TRANSLATION
Sukadeva Gosvami, the son of Vyasadeva, in his turn delivered the
Bhagavatam to the great Emperor Pariksit, who sat surrounded by sages on
the bank of the Ganges, awaiting death without taking food or drink. ॥
PURPORT

All transcendental messages are received properly in the chain of
disciplic succession. This disciplic succession is called parampara. Unless
therefore Bhagavatam or any other Vedic literatures are received through
the parampara system, the reception of knowledge is not bona fide.
Vyasadeva delivered the message to Sukadeva Gosvami, and from Sukadeva
Gosvami Sita Gosvami received the message. One should, therefore, receive
the message of Bhagavatam from Siita Gosvami or from his representative
and not from any irrelevant interpreter.

Emperor Pariksit received the information of his death in time, and he
at once left his kingdom and family and sat down on the bank of the
Ganges to fast till death. All great sages, rsis, philosophers, mystics, etc.,
went there due to his imperial position. They offered many suggestions
about his immediate duty, and at last it was settled that he would hear
from Sukadeva Gosvami about Lord Krsna, and thus the Bhagavatam was
spoken to him.

Sripada Sarikaracarya, who preached Mayavada philosophy and stressed
the impersonal feature of the Absolute, also recommended that one must
take shelter at the lotus feet of Lord इत Krsna, for there is no hope of gain
from debating. Indirectly Sripad Saikaracarya admitted that what he had
preached in the flowery grammatical interpretations of the Vedanta-siitra
cannot help one at the time of death. At the critical hour of death one
must recite the name of Govinda. This is the recommendation of all great
transcendentalists. Sukadeva Gosvami had long stated the same truth, that
at the end one must remember Narayana. That is the essence of all spiritual
activities. In pursuance of this eternal truth, Srimad-Bhagavatam was heard
by Emperor Pariksit, and it was recited by the able Sukadeva Gosvami.

TRANSLATION
This Bhagavata Purana is as brilliant as the sun, and it has arisen just
after the departure of Lord Krsna to His own abode, accompanied by
religion, knowledge, etc. Persons who have lost their vision due to the dense
darkness of ignorance in the age of Kali shall get light from this Purana.
PURPORT
Lord Sri Krspa has His eternal dhama or abode where He eternally
enjoys Himself with His eternal associates and paraphernalia. And His
eternal abode is a manifestation of His internal energy, whereas the
material world is a manifestation of His external energy. When He descends
on the material world, He displays Himself with all paraphernalia in His
internal potency, which is called atma-maya. In the Bhagavad-gita the Lord
says that He descends by His own potency (atma-maya). His form, name,
fame, paraphernalia, abode, etc., are not, therefore, creations of matter.
He descends to reclaim the fallen souls and to reestablish codes of religion
which are directly enacted by Him. Except God no one can establish the
principles of religion. Either He or a suitable person empowered by Him


--- Page 191 ---
Text 44] Krsna Is the Source of All Incarnations 187
can dictate the codes of religion. Real religion means to know God, our
relation with Him, our duties in relation with Him and to know ultimately
our destination after leaving this material body. The conditioned
souls who are entrapped by the material energy hardly know all these
principles of life. Most of them are like animals engaged in eating,
sleeping, fearing and mating. They are mostly engaged in sense enjoyment
under the pretention of religiosity, knowledge or salvation. They are still
more blind in the present age of quarrel or Kali-yuga. In the Kali-yuga the
population is just a royal edition of the animals. They have nothing to do
with spiritual knowledge or godly religious life. They are so blind that
they cannot see anything beyond the needs of the body. They have no
information of the spirit soul beyond the jurisdiction of the subtle mind,
intelligence or ego, but they are very much proud of their advancement in
knowledge, science and material prosperity. They can risk their lives to
become a dog or hog just after leaving the present body, for they have
completely lost sight of the ultimate aim of life. The Personality of God-
head Sri Krsna appeared before us just a little prior to the beginning of
Kali-yuga, and He returned to His eternal home practically at the com-
mencement of Kali-yuga. While He was present, He exhibited everything
by His different activities. He spoke the Bhagavad-gita specifically and
eradicated all pretentious principles of religiosity. And prior to His depar-
ture from this material world, He empowered Sr Vyasadeva through
Narada to compile the messages of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, and thus both
the Bhagavad-gita and the Srimad-Bhagavatam are like torch bearers for
the blind people of this age. In other words, if men in this age of Kali want
to see the real light of life, they must take to these two books only, and
their aim of life will be fulfilled. Bhagavad-gita is the preliminary study of
the Bhagavatam. And Srimad-Bhagavatam is the summum bonum of life,
Lord Sri Krsna personified. We must therefore accept Srimad-Bhagavatam
as the direct representation of Lord Krsna. One who can see Srimad-
Bhagavatam can see also Lord Sri Krsna in person. They are identical.

TRANSLATION
0 learned brahmanas, when Sukadeva Gosvami recited Bhagavatam
there [in the presence of Emperor Pariksit], by his mercy I heard this
from that great and powerful sage with rapt attention. Now I shall try to
make you hear the very same thing as I learned it from him and as I
have realized it.
PURPORT
One can certainly see directly the presence of Lord Sri Krsna in the
pages of Bhagavatam if one has heard it from a self-realized great soul like
Sukadeva Gosvami. One cannot, however, learn Bhagavatam from a bogus
hired reciter whose aim of life is to earn some money out of such reci-
tation and employ the earning in sex indulgence. No one can learn
Srimad-Bhagavatam who is associated with persons engaged in sex life.
That is the secret of learning Bhagavatam. Nor can one learn Bhagavatam
from one who interprets the text by his mundane scholarship. One has to
learn Bhagavatam from the representative of Sukadeva Gosvami and no
one else, if one at all wants to see Lord Sri Krsna in the pages. That is the
process, and there is no alternative. Siita Gosvami is a bona fide represen-
tative of Sukadeva Gosvami because he wants to present the message which
he had received from the great learned brahmapa. Sukadeva Gosvami also
presented Bhagavatam as he heard it from his great father, and so also Siita
Gosvami is presenting Bhagavatam as he had heard it from Sukadeva
Gosvami. Simple hearing is not all; one must realize the text with proper


--- Page 193 ---
Text 44] Krsna Is the Source of All Incarnations 189
attention. The word nivista means that 3018 Gosvami drank the juice
of Bhagavatam through his ears. That is the real process of receiving
Bhagavatam. One should hear with rapt attention from the real person,
and then he can at once realize the presence of Lord Krsna in every page.
The secret of knowing Bhagavatam is mentioned here. No one can give
rapt attention who is not pure in mind. No one can be pure in mind who
is not pure in action. No one can be pure in action who is not pure in
eating, sleeping, fearing and mating. But somehow or other if someone
hears with rapt attention from the right person, at the very beginning one
can assuredly see Lord Sti Krsna in person in the pages of Bhagavatam.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the First Canto, Third Chapter,
of Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “Krsna Is the Source of All Incarnations.”

On hearing Siita Gosvami speak thus, Saunaka Muni, who was the

ceremony, congratulated Siita Gosvami by addressing him as follows.
PURPORT
In a meeting of learned men, when there are congratulations or addresses
for the speaker, the qualifications of the congratulator should be as follows.
He must be the leader of the house and an elderly man. He must be vastly
191


--- Page 195 ---
192 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 4
learned also. Sri Saunaka Ri had all these qualifications, and thus he stood
up to congratulate Sri Siita Gosvami when he expressed his desire to
present Srimad-Bhdgavatam exactly as he heard it from Sukadeva Gosvami
and also realized it personally. Personal realization does not mean that one
should, out of vanity, attempt to show one’s own learning by trying to
surpass the previous dcarya. He must have full confidence in the previous
dcdrya, and at the same time he must realize the subject matter so nicely
that he can present the matter for the particular circumstances in a suitable
manner. The original purpose of the text must be maintained. No obscure
meaning should be screwed out of it, yet it should be presented in an
interesting manner for the understanding of the audience. This is called
realization. The leader of the assembly, Saunaka, could estimate the value
of the speaker, इत Sita Gosvami, simply by his uttering yathadhitam and
yathamati, and therefore he was very glad to congratulate him in ecstasy.
No learned man should be willing to hear a person who does not represent
the original dcdrya. So the speaker as well as the audience were bona fide
in this meeting where Bhagavatam was being recited for the second time.
That should be the standard of recitation of Bhdgavatam, so that the real
purpose can be served without difficulty. Unless this situation is created,
Bhagavatam recitation for extraneous purposes is useless labor both for the
speaker and the audience.

Srimad-Bhagavatam, which was spoken by the great powerful sage
Sukadeva Gosvami.
PURPORT
Sita Gosvami is twice addressed herein by Saunaka Gosvami out of
great joy because he and the members of the assembly were eager to hear
the text of Bhagavatam uttered by Sukadeva Gosvami. They are not
interested in hearing it from a bogus person who interprets in his own way
to suit his own purpose. Generally the so-called Bhagavatam reciters are
either professional readers or so-called learned impersonalists who cannot
enter into the transcendental personal activities of the Supreme Person.
Such impersonalists eschew some meanings out of Bhagavatam to suit and
support impersonalist views, and the professional readers at once go to the
Tenth Canto to misexplain the most confidential part of the Lord’s
pastimes. Both these reciters are not bona fide persons to recite Bhaga-
vatam. Only one who is prepared to present Bhagavatam in the light of
Sukadeva Gosvami and only those who are prepared to hear Sukadeva
Gosvami and his representative are bona fide participants in the transcen-
dental discussion of Srimad-Bhagavatam.

TRANSLATION
In what period and at what place was this first begun, and why was this
taken up? From where did Krsna-dvaipayana Vyasa, the great sage, get
the inspiration to compile this literature?
PURPORT
Because Srimad-Bhagavatam is the special contribution of Srila Vyasa-
deva, there are so many inquiries by the learned Saunaka Muni. It was
known to them that Srila Vyasadeva had already explained the text of the
Vedas in various ways up to the Mahabharata for the understanding of less
iss women, इद्वा and fallen members of the family of twice-born
men. Srimad-Bhagavatam is transcendental to all of them because it has
nothing to do with anything mundane. So the inquiries are very intelligent
and relevant.

TRANSLATION
His [Vyasadeva’s] son was a great devotee, an equibalanced monist,
whose mind was always concentrated in monism. He was not ignorant, but
was transcendental to mundane activities.
PURPORT
Srila Sukadeva Gosvaimi was a liberated soul, and thus he remained
always alert not to be trapped by the illusory energy. In the Bhagavad-gita


--- Page 198 ---
Text 5] Appearance of Sri Narada 195
this alertness is very lucidly explained. The liberated soul and the condi-
tioned soul have different engagements. The liberated soul is always
engaged in the progressive path of spiritual attainment, which is something
like a dream for the conditioned soul. The conditioned soul cannot
imagine the actual engagements of the liberated soul. While the conditioned
soul thus dreams about spiritual engagements, the liberated soul is awake.
Similarly, the engagement of a conditioned soul appears to be a dream for
the liberated soul. Apparently a conditioned soul and a liberated soul may
seem to be on the same platform, but factually they are differently
engaged, and their attention is always alert, either in sense enjoyment or
in self-realization. The conditioned soul is absorbed in matter, whereas the
liberated soul is completely indifferent to matter. This indifference is
explained as follows.

TRANSLATION
While Sri Vyasadeva was following his son, beautiful young damsels,

who were bathing naked, covered their bodies with cloth, although पे
Vyasadeva himself was not naked. But they did not do so when his son
passed. The sage inquired about this, and the young ladies replied that his


--- Page 199 ---
196 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 4
son was purified and when looking at them made no distinction between
male and female. But the sage made such distinctions.
PURPORT

In the Bhagavad-gitd it is said that a learned sage looks equally on the
learned and gentle brahmana, a candala (dog-eater), a dog or cow due to
his spiritual vision. Srila Sukadeva Gosvam attained that stage. Thus he
did not see a male or female, but he saw all living entities in different dress.
The ladies who were bathing could understand the mind of a man simply
by studying his demeanor, just as by looking at a child one can understand
how innocent he is. Sukadeva Gosvami was a young boy sixteen years old,
and therefore all the parts of his body were developed. He was naked also,
and so were the ladies. But because व Gosvami was transcendental
to sex relations, he appeared very innocent. The ladies, by their special
qualifications, could sense this at once, and therefore they were not very
concerned about him. But when his father passed, the ladies quickly
dressed. The ladies were exactly like his children or grandchildren, yet
they reacted to the presence of Vyasadeva according to the social custom
because Srila Vyasadeva played the part of a householder. A householder
has to distinguish between a male and female, otherwise he cannot be
a householder. One should, therefore, attempt to know the distinction be-
tween spirit soul without any attachment for male and female. As long as
such distinction is there, one should not try to become a sannyasi like
Sukadeva Gosvami. At least theoretically one must be convinced that a
living entity is neither a male nor female. The outward dress is made of
matter by material nature to attract the opposite sex and thus keep one
entangled in material existence. A liberated soul is above this perverted
distinction. He does not distinguish between one living being and another.
For him they are all one and the same spirit. The perfection of this
spiritual vision is the liberated stage, and Srila Sukadeva Gosvami attained
that stage. Srila Vyasadeva was also in the transcendental stage, but
because he was in the householder’s life, he did not pretend to be a
liberated soul, as a matter of custom.

TRANSLATION
How was he [Srila Sukadeva, the son of Vyasa] recognized by the
citizens when he entered the city of Hastinapura [now Delhi], after
wandering in the provinces of Kuru and Jangala, appearing like a madman,
dumb and retarded?
PURPORT
The present city of Delhi was formerly known as Hastinapura because it
was first established by King Hasti. Gosvami Sukadeva, after leaving his
paternal home, was roaming like a madman, and therefore it was very
difficult for the citizens to recognize him in his exalted position. A sage is
not, therefore, recognized by sight, but by hearing. One should approach
a sadhu or great sage not to see but to hear him. If one is not prepared to
hear the words of a sadhu, there is no profit. Sukadeva Gosvami was a
sadhu who could speak on the transcendental activities of the Lord. He did
not satisfy the whims of ordinary citizens. He was recognized when he
spoke on the subject of Bhagavatam, and he never attempted jugglery like
a magician. Outwardly he appeared to be a retarded, dumb madman, but
in fact he was the most elevated transcendental personality.

Srimad-Bhagavatam is stated here as the essence of the Vedas. It is not
an imaginary story as it is sometimes considered by unauthorized men. It
is also called Suka-sarhitd, or the Vedic hymn spoken by Sri Sukadeva
Gosvami, the great liberated sage.

--- Page 202 ---
Text 9] Appearance of Sri Narada 199
PURPORT
Sukadeva Gosvami met Emperor Pariksit and explained the text of
Srimad-Bhagavatam. He was not accustomed to stay at any householders
residence for more than half an hour (at the time of milking the cow), and
he would just take alms from the fortunate householder. That was to
sanctify the residence by his auspicious presence. Therefore Sukadeva
Gosvami is an ideal preacher established in the transcendental position.
From his activities, those who are in the renounced order of life and
dedicated to the mission of preaching the message of Godhead should
learn that they have no business with householders save and except to
enlighten them in transcendental knowledge. Such asking for alms from
the householder should be for the purpose of sanctifying his home. One
who is in the renounced order of life should not be allured by the glamour
of the householders worldly possessions and thus become subservient to
worldly men. For one who is in the renounced order of life, this is much
more dangerous than drinking poison and committing suicide.

TRANSLATION
It is said that Maharaja Pariksit is a great first-class devotee of the Lord
and that his birth and activities are all wonderful. Please tell us about him.
PURPORT
The birth of Maharaja Pariksit is wonderful because in the womb of his
mother he was protected by the Personality of Godhead Sri Krsna. His
activities are also wonderful because he chastised Kali, who was attempting
to kill a cow. To kill cows means to end human civilization. He wanted


--- Page 203 ---
200 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 4
to protect the cow from being killed by the great representative of sin. His
death is also wonderful because he got previous notice of his death, which
is wonderful for any mortal being, and thus he prepared himself for passing
away by sitting down on the bank of the Ganges and hearing the transcen-
dental activities of the Lord. During all the days he heard Bhagavatam, he
did not take food or drink, nor did he sleep a moment. So everything
about him is wonderful, and his activities are worth hearing attentively.
Desire is expressed herein to hear about him in detail.

He was a great emperor and possessed all the opulences of his acquired
kingdom. He was so exalted that he was increasing the prestige of the
Pandu dynasty. Why did he give up everything to sit down on the bank of
the Ganges and fast until death?
PURPORT

Maharaja Pariksit was the Emperor of the world and all the seas and
oceans, and he did not have to take the trouble to acquire such a kingdom
by his own effort. He inherited it from his grandfathers Maharaja
Yudhisthira and brothers. Besides that, he was doing well in the adminis-
tration and was worthy of the good names of his forefathers. Consequently


--- Page 204 ---
Text 11] Appearance of Sri Narada 201
there was nothing undesirable in his opulence and administration. Then
why should he give up all these favorable circumstances and sit down on
the bank of the Ganges, fasting till death? This is astonishing, and therefore
all were eager to know the cause.

He was such a great emperor that all his enemies would come and bow
down at his feet and surrender all their wealth for their own benefit. He
was full of youth and strength, and he possessed insuperable kingly opu-
lences. Why did he want to give up everything, including his life?
PURPORT
There was nothing undesirable in his life. He was quite a young man and
could enjoy life with power and opulence. So there was no question of
retiring from active life. There was no difficulty in collecting the state
taxes because he was so powerful and chivalrous that even his enemies
would come to him and bow down at his feet and surrender all wealth for

their own benefit. Maharaja Pariksit was a pious king. He conquered his
enemies, and therefore the kingdom was full of prosperity. There was
enough milk, grains and metals, and all the rivers and mountains were full
of potency. So materially everything was satisfactory. Therefore, there
was no question of untimely giving up his kingdom and life. They were
eager to hear about all this.

Those who are devoted to the cause of the Personality of Godhead live
only for the welfare, development and happiness of others. They do not
live for any selfish interest. So even though the Emperor [Pariksit] was
free from all attachment to worldly possessions, how could he give up his
mortal body, which was shelter for others?
PURPORT
Pariksit Maharaja was an ideal king and householder because he was a
devotee of the Personality of Godhead. A devotee of the Lord has
automatically all good qualifications. And the Emperor was a typical


--- Page 206 ---
Text 13] Appearance of Sri Narada 203
example of this. Personally he had no attachment for all the worldly
opulences in his possession. But since he was king for the all round
welfare of his citizens, he was always busy in the welfare work of the
public, not only for this life, but also for the next. He would not allow
slaughter-houses or killing of cows. He was not a foolish and partial
administrator who would arrange for the protection of one living being
and allow another to be killed. Because he was a devotee of the Lord, he
knew perfectly well how to conduct his administration for everyone's
happiness, men, animals, plants and all living creatures. He was not
selfishly interested. Selfishness is either self-centered or self-extended.
He was neither. His interest was to please the Supreme Truth Personality
of Godhead. The king is the representative of the Supreme Lord, and
therefore the king’s interest must be identical with that of the Supreme
Lord. The Supreme Lord wants all living beings to be obedient to Him
and thereby become happy. Therefore the king's interest is to guide
all subjects back to the kingdom of God. Hence the activities of the
citizens should be so coordinated that they can at the end go back home,
back to Godhead. Under the administration of a representative king, the
kingdom is full of opulence. At that time human beings need not eat
animals. There is ample food, grains, milk, fruit and vegetables so that the
human beings as well as the animals can eat sumptuously and to their
heart’s content. If all living beings are satisfied with food and shelter and
obey the prescribed rules, there cannot be any disturbance between one
living being and another. Emperor Pariksit was a worthy king, and therefore
all were happy during his reign.

TRANSLATION
We know that you are expert in the meaning of all subjects, except some
portions of the Vedas, and thus you can clearly explain the answers to
all the questions we have just put to you.
PURPORT

The difference between the Vedas and the Puranas 15 like that between
the brahmanas and the purivrajakas. The brahmanas are meant to administer
some fruitive sacrifices mentioned in the Vedas, but the parivrajakdacaryas,
or learned preachers, are meant to disseminate transcendental knowledge
to one and all. As such, the parivrgjakdcaryas are not always expert in
pronouncing the Vedic mantras, which are practiced systematically by
accent and meter by the brahmanas who are meant for administering Vedic
rites. Yet it should not be considered that the brahmanas are more
important than the itinerant preachers. They are one and different
simultaneously because they are meant for the same end, in different
ways.

There is no difference also between the Vedic mantras and what is
explained in the Puranas and 11111650. According to Srila Jiva Gosvami, it is
mentioned in the Madhyandina-$ruti that all the Vedas, namely the
Sama, Atharva, Rk, Yajus, Puranas, Itihasas, Upanisads, etc., are emanations
from the breathing of the Supreme Being. The only difference is that the
Vedic mantras are mostly begun with prapava omkara, and it requires some
training to practice the metric pronunciation of the Vedic mantras. But
that does not mean that Srimad-Bhdgavatam was of less importance than
the Vedic mantras. On the other hand, it is the ripened fruit of all the
Vedas, as stated before. Besides that, the most perfectly liberated soul,
Srila Sukadeva Gosvami, is absorbed in the studies of the Bhagavatam,
although 116 is already self-realized. Srila Siita Gosvami is following his
footsteps, and therefore his position is not the least less important because
he was not expert in chanting Vedic mantras with metric pronunciation,
which depends more on practice than actual realization. Realization is
more important than parrot-like chanting.

Suita Gosvami said: When the second millennium overlapped the third,

PURPORT
There is a chronological order of the four millenniums, namely Satya,
Dvapara, Treta and Kali. But sometimes there is overlapping. During the
regime of Vaivasvata Manu, there was an overlapping of the twenty-eighth
round of the four millenniums, and the third millennium appeared prior
to the second. In that particular millennium, Lord Sri Krsna also descends,
and because of this there was some particular alteration. The mother of
the great sage was Satyavati the daughter of the Vasu (fisherman), and the
father was the great Parasara Muni. That is the history of Vyasadeva’s
birth. Every millennium is divided into three periods, and each period is
called a sandhya. Vyasadeva appeared in the third sandhya of that
particular age.

Kali age, and accordingly he made arrangement for the people in general
so that they can execute a progressive life in this age which is full of dark-
ness. The people in general in this age of Kali are too much interested in
matter, which is temporary. Because of ignorance they are unable to
evaluate the assets of life and be enlightened in spiritual knowledge.

to lack of goodness. Thus he contemplated for the welfare of men in all
statuses and orders of life.

PURPORT

The unmanifested forces of time are so powerful that they reduce all
matter to oblivion in due course. In Kali-yuga, the last millennium of a
round of the four millenniums, the power of all material objects deteriorates
by the influence of time. In this age the duration of the material body of
the people in general is much reduced, and so is the memory. The action
of matter has also not so much incentive. The land does not produce food
grains in the same proportions as it did in other ages. The cow does not
give as much milk as it used to give formerly. The production of vegelables
and fruits is less than before. As such, all living beings, both men and
animals, do not have sumptuous, nourishing food. Due to want of so many
necessities of life, naturally the duration of life is reduced, the memory is
short, intelligence is meager, mutual dealings are full of hypocrisy and so
on.

The great sage Vyasadeva could see this by his transcendental vision. As
an astrologer can see the future fate of a man, or an astronomer can
foretell the solar and lunar eclipses, similarly those who can see through
the scriptures and foretell the future of all mankind are called liberated
souls. They can see thus due to their sharp vision of spiritual attainment.

And all such transcendentalists, who are naturally devotees of the Lord,
are always eager to render welfare service to the people in general. They
are the real friends of the people in general, not the so-called public
leaders who are unable to see what is going to happen five minutes ahead.
In this age the people in general as well as their so-called leaders are all
unlucky fellows, faithless in spiritual knowledge and influenced by the
age of Kali. They are always disturbed by various diseases. For example, in
the present age there are so many TB patients and TB hospitals, but
formerly this was not so because the time was not so unfavorable. These
unfortunate men of this age are always reluctant to give a reception to the
transcendentalists who are representatives of Srila Vyasadeva and selfless
workers always busy in planning something which may help everyone in all
statuses and orders of life. The greatest philanthropists are those transcen-
dentalists who represent the mission of Vyasa, Narada, Madhva, Caitanya,
Riipa, Sarasvati, etc. They are all one and the same. The personalities may
be different, but the aim of the mission is one and the same, namely, to
deliver the fallen souls back home, back to Godhead.

TRANSLATION
He saw that the sacrifices mentioned in the Vedas were means by
which the people’s occupations could be purified. And to simplify the
process he divided the one Veda into four, in order to expand them
among men.

PURPORT
Formerly there was only the Veda of the name Yajus, and the four
divisions of sacrifices were there specifically mentioned. But to make them
more easily performable, the Veda was divided into four divisions of
sacrifice, just to purify the occupational service of the four orders. Above
the four Vedas, namely RE, Yajus, Sama, and Atharva, there are the
Puranas, the Mahabharata, Samhitas, etc., which are known as the fifth
Veda. Sri Vyasadeva and his many disciples were all historical personalities,
and they were very kind and sympathetic toward the fallen souls of this
age of Kali. As such, the Puranas and Mahabharata were made from related
historical facts which explained the teaching of the four Vedas. There is no
point in doubting the authority of the Puranas and Mahabharata as parts
and parcels of the Vedas. In the Chandogya Upanisad, the Puranas and
Mahabharata, generally known as histories, are mentioned as the fifth
Veda. According to Srila Jiva Gosvami, that is the way of ascertaining the

respective values of the revealed scriptures.

In the Sruti-mantras also it is stated that Angira Muni, who strictly
followed the rigid principles of the Atharva-vedas, was the leader of the
followers of the Atharva-vedas.

TRANSLATION
All these learned scholars, in their turn, rendered their entrusted Vedas
unto their many disciples, grand disciples and great grand disciples, and
thus the respective branches of the followers of the Vedas came into being.
PURPORT

The original source of knowledge is the Vedas. There are no branches of
knowledge, either mundane or transcendental, which do not belong to the
original text of the Vedas. They have simply been developed into different
branches. They were originally rendered by great, respectable and learned
professors. In other words, the Vedic knowledge, broken into different
branches by different disciplic successions, has been distributed all over
the world. No one, therefore, can claim independent knowledge beyond
the Vedas.

Text 25] Appearance of Sri Narada 213
TRANSLATION
Thus the great sage Vyasadeva, who is very kind to the ignorant
masses, edited the Vedas so they might be assimilated by less intellectual
men.
PURPORT
The Veda is one, and the reasons for its divisions in many parts are ex-
plained herewith. The seed of all knowlegde, or the Veda, is not a subject
matter which can easily be understood by any ordinary man. There is a
stricture that no one should try to learn the Vedas who is not a qualified
brahmana. This stricture has been wrongly interpreted in so many ways.
A class of men, who claim brahminical qualification simply by their birth
right in the family of a brahmana, claim that the study of the Vedas is a
monopoly of the brahmana caste only. Another section of the people take
this as an injustice to other castes who do not happen to take birth in a
brahmana family. But both of them are misguided. The Vedas are sub-
jects which had to be explained even to Brahmaji by the Supreme Lord.
Therefore the subject matter is understood by persons with exceptional
qualities of goodness. Persons who are in the modes of passion and ignor-
ance are unable to understand the subject matter of the Vedas. The ultimate
-goal of Vedic knowledge is Sri Krsna, the Personality of Godhead. This
Personality is very rarely understood by those who are in the modes
of passion and ignorance. In the Satya-yuga everyone was situated
in the mode of goodness. Gradually the mode of goodness declined
during the Treta and Dwapara-yugas, and the general mass of people
became corrupt. In the present age the mode of goodness is almost nil,
and so for the general mass of people, the kindhearted, powerful sage
Srila Vyasadeva divided the Vedas in various ways so that they may be
practically followed by less intelligent persons in the modes of passion
and ignorance. It is explained in the next sloka as follows.

TRANSLATION
Out of compassion, the great sage thought it wise that this would
enable men to achieve the ultimate goal of life. Thus he compiled the
great historical narration called the Mahabharata for women, laborers
and friends of the twice-born.
PURPORT
The friends of the twice-born families are those who are born in the
families of brahmanas, ksatriyas and vaiSyas, or the spiritually cultured
families, but they themselves are not equal to their forefathers. Such
descendants are not recognized as such for want of purificatory achieve-
ments. The purificatory activities begin even before the birth of a child,
and the seed-giving reformatory process is called Garbhadhana-sariskara.
One who has not undergone such Garbhadhana-samskara, or spiritual
family planning, is not accepted as being of an actual twice-born family.
The Garbhadhana-sariskara is followed by other purificatory processes
out of which the sacred thread ceremony is one. This is performed at the
time of spiritual initiation. After this particular sariskdra, one is rightly
called twice-born. One birth is calculated during the seed-givirlg sariskara,
and the second birth is calculated at the time of spiritual initiation. One
who has been able to undergo such important samskaras can be called a
bona fide twice-born.
If the father and the mother do not undertake the process of spiritual
family planning and simply beget children out of passion only, their
children are called dvija-bandhus. These dvija-bandhus are certainly not as


--- Page 218 ---
Text 26] Appearance of Sri Narada 215
intelligent as the children of the regular twice-born families. The dvija-
bandhus are classified as ईका and the woman class, who are by nature
less intelligent. The $idras and the woman class do not have to undergo
any sariskdra save and except the ceremony of marriage.

The less intelligent classes of men, namely women, Sidras and un-
qualified sons of the higher castes, are devoid of necessary qualifications
to understand the purpose of the transcendental Vedas. For them the
Mahabharata was prepared. The purpose of the Mahabharata is to adminis-
ter the purpose of the Vedas, and therefore within this Mahabharata the
summary Veda of Bhagavad-gita is placed. The less intelligent are more
interested in stories than in philosophy, and therefore the philosophy of
the Vedas in the form of the Bhagavad-gita is spoken by the Lord Sri
Krsna. Vyasadeva and Lord Krsna are both on the transcendental plane,
and therefore they collaborated in doing good to the fallen souls of this
age. The Bhagavad-gitd is the essence of all Vedic knowledge. It is the
first book of spiritual values, as the Upanisads are. The Vedanta philosophy
is the subject matter for study by the spiritual graduates. Only the post-
graduate spiritual student can enter into the spiritual or devotional service
of the Lord. It is a great science, and the great professor is the Lord Him-
self in the form of Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and persons who are
empowered by Him can initiate others in the transcendental loving service
of the Lord.

O twice-born brahmanas, still his mind was not satisfied, although he
engaged himself in working for the total welfare of all people.


--- Page 219 ---
216 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 4
PURPORT
Sri Vyasadeva was not satisfied with himself, although he prepared lit-
eratures of Vedic value for the all-around welfare of the general mass of
people. It was expected that he would be satisfied by all such activities,
but ultimately he was not satisfied.

TRANSLATION
Thus the sage, being dissatisfied at heart, at once began to reflect,
because he knew the essence of religion, and he said within himself:
PURPORT
The sage began to search out the cause of not being satisfied at heart.
Perfection is never attained until one is satisfied at heart. This satisfaction
of heart has to be searched out beyond matter.

I have, under strict disciplinary vows, unpretentiously worshiped the
Vedas, the spiritual master and the altar of sacrifice. I have also abided by
the rulings and have shown the import of disciplic succession through the
explanation of the Mahabharata by which even women, 80015 and others
[friends of the twice-born| can see the path of religion.
PURPORT
No one can understand the import of the Vedas without having under-
gone a strict disciplinary vow and disciplic succession. The Vedas, spiritual
masters and sacrificial fire must be worshiped by the desiring candidate.
All these intricacies of Vedic knowledge are systematically presented in the
Mahabharata for the understanding of the women class, laborer class and
the unqualified members of brahmana, ksatriya or vaisya families. In this
age, the Mahabharata is more essential than the original Vedas.

PURPORT
Undoubtedly Srila Vyasadeva was complete in all the details of Vedic
achievements. Purification of the living being submerged in matter is made
possible by the prescribed activities in the Vedas, but the ultimate achieve-
ment is different. Unless it is attained, the living being, even though fully
equipped, cannot be situated in the transcendentally normal stage. Srila
Vyasadeva appeared to have lost the clue and therefore felt dissatisfaction.

TRANSLATION
This may be because I did not specifically point out the devotional
service of the Lord, which is dear both to perfect beings and the infallible
Lord.
PURPORT
The dissatisfaction which was being felt by Srila Vyasadeva is expressed
herein in his own words. This was felt for the normal condition of the
living being in the devotional service of the Lord. Unless one is fixed in the
normal condition of service, neither the Lord nor the living being can
become fully satisfied. This defect was felt by him when Narada Muni, his
spiritual master, reached him. It is described as follows.
TEXT 32

udahrtam—said.
TRANSLATION
As mentioned before, Narada reached the cottage of Krsna-dvaipayana
Vyasa on the banks of the Sarasvati just as he was regretting his defects.
PURPORT
The vacuum felt by Vyasadeva was not due to his lack of knowledge.
Bhagavata-dharma is purely devotional service of the Lord to which the
monist has no access. The monist is not counted amongst the parama-
harisas (the most perfect of the renounced order of life). Srimad-


--- Page 223 ---
220 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 4
Bhagavatam is full of narrations of the transcendental activities of the
Personality of Godhead. Although Vyasadeva was an empowered Divinity,
he still felt dissatisfaction because in none of his works were the transcen-
dental activities of the Lord properly explained. The inspiration was
infused by Sr Krsna directly in the heart of Vyasadeva, and thus he felt
the vacuum as explained above. 11 is definitely expressed herewith that
without transcendental loving service of the Lord, everything is void; but
in the transcendental service of the Lord everything is tangible without
any separate attempt at fruitive work or empiric philosophical speculation.

TRANSLATION
At the auspicious arrival of Sri Narada, Sri Vyasadeva got up respect-
fully and worshiped him, giving him veneration equal to that given to
Brahmaji, the creator.
PURPORT
Vidhi means Brahma, the first created living being. He is the original
student as well as professor of the Vedas. He learned it from Sri Krsna and
taught Narada first. So Narada is the second dcdarya in the line of spiritual
disciplic succession. He is the representative of Brahma, and therefore he
is respected exactly like Brahma, the father of all vidhis (regulations);


--- Page 224 ---
Text 33] Appearance of Sri Narada 221
similarly all other successive disciples in the chain are also equally respect-
ed as representatives of the original spiritual master.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the First Canto, Fourth Chapter,
of Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “Appearance of Sri Narada.”

TRANSLATION
Sata Gosvami said: Thus the sage among the gods [Narada], com-
fortably seated and apparently smiling, addressed the rsi amongst the
brahmanas [Vedavyasa].
PURPORT
Narada was smiling because he well knew the great sage Vedavyasa and
the cause of his disappointment. As he will explain gradually, Vyasadeva’s
disappointment was due to insufficiency in presenting the science of
devotional service. Narada knew the defect, and it was confirmed by the
position of Vyasa.

TRANSLATION
Addressing Vyasadeva, the son of Parasara, Narada inquired: Are you
satisfied by identifying with the body or the mind as objects of self-
realization?
PURPORT
This was a hint by Narada to Vyasadeva regarding the cause of his
despondency. Vyasadeva, as the descendant of Paragara, a greatly powerful
sage, had the privilege of having a great parentage which should not have
given Vyasadeva cause for despondency. Being a great son of a great father,
he should not have identified the self with the body or the mind. Ordinary
men with a poor fund of knowledge can identify the body as self or the
mind as self, but Vyasadeva should not have done so. One cannot be
cheerful by nature unless one is factually seated in self-realization, which
is transcendental to the material body and mind.

Your inquiries were full and your studies were also well fulfilled, and «
there is no doubt that you have prepared a great and wonderful work, the
Mahabharata, which is full of all kinds of Vedic sequences elaborately
explained.
PURPORT
The despondency of Vyasadeva was certainly not due to his lack of
sufficient knowledge because as a student he had fully inquired about the
Vedic literatures, as a result of which the Mahabharata is compiled with
full explanation of the Vedas.

You have fully delineated the subject of impersonal Brahman as well
as the knowledge derived therefrom. In spite of all this, why should you
be despondent, thinking that you are undone, my dear prabhu.
PURPORT
The Vedanta-siitra or Brahma-siitra compiled by Sri Vyasadeva is the
full deliberation of the impersonal absolute feature, and it is accepted as
the most exalted philosophical exposition in the world. It covers the
subject of eternity, and the methods are scholarly. So there cannot be
any doubt about the transcendental scholarship of Vyasadeva. So why
should he lament?

cause of my dissatisfaction, for you are a man of unlimited knowledge due

to your being the offspring of one [Brahma] who is self-born [without
mundane father and mother].
PURPORT
In the material world everyone is engrossed with the idea of identifying
the body or the mind with the self. As such, all knowledge disseminated in
the material world is related either with the body or with the mind, and
that is the root cause of all despondencies. This is not always detected,
even though one may be the greatest erudite scholar in materialistic
knowledge. It is good, therefore, to approach a personality like Narada to
solve the root cause of all despondencies. Why Narada should be ap-
proached is explained below.

228 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 5
PURPORT
A person who is cent percent engaged in the service of the Lord is the
emblem of all knowledge. Such a devotee of the Lord in full perfection of
devotional service is also perfect by the qualification of the Personality of
Godhead. As such, the eightfold perfections of mystic power (asta-siddhi)
constitute very little of his godly opulence. A devotee like Narada can act
wonderfully by his spiritual perfection, which every individual is trying
to attain. Srila Narada is a cent percent perfect living being, although
not equal to the Personality of Godhead.

Sri Narada said: You have not actually broadcast the sublime and

does not satisfy the transcendental senses of the Lord is considered
worthless. .
PURPORT
The eternal relation of an individual soul with the Supreme Soul
Personality of Godhead is constitutionally one of being the eternal servitor
of the eternal master. The Lord has expanded Himself as living beings in
order to accept loving service from them, and this alone can satisfy both
the Lord and the living beings. A scholar like Vyasadeva has completed
many expansions of the Vedic literatures, ending with the Vedanta


--- Page 239 ---
230 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 5
philosophy, but none of them have been written directly glorifying the
Personality of Godhead. Dry philosophical speculations even on the
transcendental subject of the Absolute have very little attraction without
directly dealing with the glorification of the Lord. The Personality of
Godhead 15 the last word in transcendental realization. The Absolute
realized as impersonal Brahman or localized Supersoul, Paramatma, is less
productive of transcendental bliss than the Supreme Personal realization
of His glories.

The compiler of the Vedanta-darsana is Vyasadeva himself. Yet he is
troubled, although he is the author. So what sort of transcendental
bliss can be derived by the readers and listeners of Vedanta which is not
explained directly by Vyasadeva the author? Herein arises the necessity of
explaining Vedanta-sitra in the form of Srimad-Bhagavatam by the self-
same author.

TRANSLATION
Although, great sage, you have very broadly described the four
principles beginning with religious performances, you have not described
the glories of the Supreme Personality, Vasudeva.
PURPORT

The prompt diagnosis of Sri Narada is at once declared. The root cause

of the despondency of Vyasadeva was his deliberate avoidance of glorifying


--- Page 240 ---
Text 10] Narada’s Instructions on Srimad-Bhagavatam 231
the Lord in his various editions of the Puranas. He has certainly, as a matter
of course, given descriptions of the glories of the Lord (Sti Krsna) but not
as many as given to religiosity, economic development, sense gratification
and salvation. These four items are by far inferior to engagement in the
devotional service of the Lord. Sri Vyisadeva as the authorized scholar
knew very well this difference. And still instead of giving more importance
to the better type of engagement, namely, the devotional service to the
Lord, he had more or less improperly used his valuable time, and thus he
was despondent. From this it is clearly indicated that no one can be
pleased substantially without being engaged in the devotional service of
the Lord. In the Bhagavad-gita this fact is clearly mentioned.

After liberation, which is the last item in the line of performing
religiosity, etc., one is engaged in pure devotional service. This is called
the stage of self-realization or brahma-bhiita stage. After attainment of
this brahma-bhiita stage, one is satisfied. But satisfaction is the beginning
of transcendental bliss. One should progress by attaining neutrality and
equality in the relative world. And passing this stage of equanimity, one is
fixed up in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. This is the
instruction of the Personality of Godhead in the Bhagavad-gita. The
conclusion is that in order to maintain the status quo of the brahma-bhiita
stage, as also to increase the degree of transcendental realization, it is
recommended by Narada to Vyasadeva that he (Vyasadeva) should now
eagerly and repeatedly describe the path of devotional service. This would
cure him from gross despondency.

pilgrimage; usanti—think; manasah—saintly persons; na—not; yatra—where;
harsah—all-perfect beings; niramanti—take pleasure; usikksayah—those

TRANSLATION
Those words which do not describe the glories of the Lord, who alone
can sanctify the atmosphere of the whole universe, are considered by
saintly persons to be like unto a place of pilgrimage for crows. Since the
all-perfect persons are inhabitants of the transcendental abode, they do not
derive any pleasure there.
PURPORT

Crows and swans are not birds of the same feather because of their
different mental attitudes. The fruitive workers or passionate men are
compared to the crows, whereas the all-perfect saintly persons are
compared to the swans. The crows take pleasure in a place where garbage
is thrown out, just as the passionate fruitive workers take pleasure in wine
and woman and places for gross sense pleasure. The swans do not take
pleasure in the places where crows are assembled for conferences and
meetings. They are instead seen in the atmosphere of natural scenic
beauty where there are transparent reservoirs of water nicely decorated
with stems of lotus flowers in variegated colors of natural beauty. That is
the difference between the two classes of birds.

Nature has influenced different species of life with different mentalities,
and it is not possible to bring them up into the same rank and file.

Similarly, there are different kinds of literature for different types of
men of different mentality. Mostly the market literatures which attract
men of the crow’s categories are literatures containing refused remnants of
sensuous topics. They are generally known as mundane talks in re-
lation with the gross body and subtle mind. They are full of sub-
ject matter described in decorative language full of mundane similes
and metaphorical arrangements. Yet with all that, they do not glorify
the Lord. Such poetry and prose, on any subject matter, is considered
decoration of a dead body. Spiritually advanced men who are compared
with the swans do not take pleasure in such dead literatures, which are
sources of pleasure for men who are spiritually dead. These literatures in
the modes of passion and ignorance are distributed under different labels,
but they can hardly help the spiritual urge of the human being, and thus
the swanlike spiritually advanced men have nothing to do with them. Such


--- Page 242 ---
Text 11] Narada’s Instructions on Srimad-Bhagavatam 233
spiritually advanced men are called also manasa because they always keep
up the standard of transcendental voluntary service to the Lord on the
spiritual plane. This completely forbids fruitive activities for gross bodily
sense salisfaction or subtle speculation of the material egoistic mind.
Social literary men, scientists, mundane poets, theoretical philosophers
and politicians who are completely absorbed in the material advancement
of sense pleasure are all dolls of the material energy. They take pleasure
in a place where rejected subject matters are thrown. According to Svami
Sridhara, this is the pleasure of the prostitute hunters.
But literatures which describe the glories of the Lord are enjoyed by
the paramaharsas who have grasped the essence of human activities.

TRANSLATION
On the other hand, that literature which is full of descriptions of the
transcendental glories of the name, fame, forms, pastimes, etc., of the
unlimited Supreme Lord is a different creation, full of transcendental
words directed toward bringing about a revolution in the impious lives of
this world’s misdirected civilization. Such transcendental literatures, even


--- Page 243 ---
234 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 5
though imperfectly composed, are heard, sung and accepted by purified
men who are thoroughly honest.
PURPORT

It is a qualification of the great thinkers to pick up the best even from
the worst. It is said that the intelligent man should pick up nectar from a
stock of poison, should accept gold even from a filthy place, should
accept a good and qualified wife even from an obscure family and should
accept a good lesson even from a man or from a teacher who comes from
the untouchables. These are some of the ethical instructions for everyone
in every place without exception. But a saint is far above the level of an
ordinary man, and he is always absorbed in glorifying the Supreme Lord
because by broadcasting the holy name and fame of the Supreme Lord,
the polluted atmosphere of the world will change, and as a result of
propagating the transcendental literatures like Srimad-Bhdgavatam, people
will become sane in their transactions. While preparing this commentation
on this particular stanza of Srimad-Bhagavatam we have a crisis before us.
Our neighboring friend China has attacked the border of India with a
militaristic spirit. We have practically no business in the political field, yet
we see that previously there were both China and India, and they both
lived peacefully for centuries without ill feeling. The reason is that they
lived those days in an atmosphere of God consciousness, and every
country, over the surface of the world, was God-fearing, purehearted and
simple, and there was no question of political diplomacy. There is no
cause of quarrel between the two countries of China and India over land
which is not very suitable for habitation, and certainly there is no cause
for fighting on this issue. But due to the age of quarrel, Kali, which we
have discussed, there is always a chance of quarrel on slight provocation.
This is due not to the issue in question, but to the polluted atmosphere of
this age: systematically there is propaganda by a section of people to stop
glorification of the name and fame of the Supreme Lord. Therefore, there
is great need for disseminating the message of Srimad-Bhagavatam all over
the world. It is the duty of every responsible Indian to broadcast the
transcendental message of Srimad-Bhagavatam throughout the world to do
all the supermost good as well as to bring about the desired peace
in the world. Because India has failed in her duty by neglecting this
responsible work, there is so much quarrel and trouble all over the
world. We are confident that if the transcendental message of Srimad-
Bhagavatam is received only by the leading men of the world, certainly


--- Page 244 ---
Text 11] Narada’s Instructions on Srimad-Bhagavatam 235
there will be a change of heart, and naturally the people in general will
follow them. The mass of people in general are tools in the hands of the
modern politicians and leaders of the people. If there is a change of heart
of the leaders only, certainly there will be a radical change in the atmos-
phere of the world. We know that our honest attempt to present this
great literature conveying transcendental messages for reviving the God
consciousness of the people in general and respiritualizing the world
atmosphere is fraught with many difficulties. Our presenting this matter in
adequate language, especially a foreign language, will certainly fail, and
there will be so many literary discrepancies despite our honest attempt to
present it in the proper way. But we are sure that with all our faults in this
connection the seriousness of the subject matter will be taken into con-
sideration, and the leaders of society will still accept this due to its being
an honest attempt to glorify the Almighty God. When there is fire in a
house, the inmates of the house go out to get help from the neighbors who
may be foreigners, and yet without knowing the language the victims of
the fire express themselves, and the neighbors understand the need, even
though not expressed in the same language. The same spirit of cooperation
is needed to broadcast this transcendental message of the Srimad-
Bhagavatam throughout the polluted atmosphere of the world. After all, it
is a technical science of spiritual values, and thus we are concerned with
the techniques and not with the language. If the techniques of this great
literature are understood by the people of the world, there will be success.

When there are too many materialistic activities by the people in general
all over the world, there is no wonder that a person or a nation attacks
another person or nation on slight provocation. That is the rule of this age
of Kali or quarrel. The atmosphere is already polluted with corruption of
all description, and everyone knows it well. There are so many unwanted
literatures full of materialistic ideas of sense gratification. The people in
general want to read (that is a natural instinct), but because their minds
are polluted they want such literatures. Under the circumstances, transcen-
dental literature like Srimad-Bhagavatam will not only diminish the
activities of the corrupt mind of the people in general, but also it will
supply food for their hankering after reading some interesting literature.
In the beginning they may not like it because one suffering from jaundice
is reluctant to take sugar-candy, but we should know that sugar-candy is
the only remedy for the jaundice. Similarly, let there be systematic
propaganda for popularizing reading of the Bhagavad-gita and the Srimad-
Bhagavatam which will act like sugar-candy for the jaundice-like condition

literatures, which are catering poison to society, will then automatically
cease.

We are sure, therefore, that everyone in the human society will welcome
Srimad-Bhagavatam, even though it is now presented with so many faults,
for it is recommended by Sri Narada, who has very kindly appeared in
this chapter.

Knowledge of self-realization, even though freed from all material
affinity, does not look well if devoid of a conception of the Infallible
[God]. What, then, is the use of fruitive activities, which are naturally
painful from the very beginning and transient by nature, if they are not
ultilized for the devotional service of the Lord?
PURPORT

As referred to above, not only ordinary literatures devoid of the tran-
scendental glorification of the Lord are condemned, but also Vedic
literatures and speculation on the subject of impersonal Brahman when


--- Page 246 ---
Text 13] Narada’s Instructions on Srimad-Bhagavatam 237
they are devoid of devotional service. When speculation on the impersonal
Brahman is condemned on the above ground, then what to speak of
ordinary fruitive work which is not meant to fulfill the aim of devotional
service. Such speculative knowledge and fruitive work cannot lead one to
the goal of perfection. Fruitive work in which almost all people in general
are engaged is always painful either in the beginning or at the end. It can
only be fruitful when made subservient to the devotional service of the
Lord. In the Bhagavad-gita also it is confirmed that the result of such
fruitive work may be offered for the service of the Lord, otherwise it leads
to material bondage. The bona fide enjoyer of the fruitive work is the
Personality of Godhead, and thus when it is engaged for the sense grati-
fication of the living beings, it becomes an acute source of trouble.

PURPORT

People in general have a taste for literatures by instinct. They want to
hear and read from the authorities something about the unknown, but
their taste is exploited by unfortunate literatures which are full of subject
matter for satisfaction of the material senses. Such literatures contain
different kinds of mundane poems and philosophical speculations, more
or less under the influence of maya, ending in sense gratification. These
literatures, although worthless in the true sense of the term, are variously
decorated to attract the attention of the less intelligent men. Thus the
attracted living entities are more and more entangled in material bondage
without hope of liberation for thousands and thousands of generations.
प Narada Rsi, being the best amongst the Vaisnavas, is compassionate
on such unfortunate victims of worthless literatures, and thus he advises
Sti Vyasadeva to compose transcendental literature which is not only
attractive but can also actually bring liberation from all kinds of bondage.
Srila Vyasadeva or his representatives are qualified because they are
rightly trained to see things in true perspective. Srila Vyasadeva and
his representatives are pure in thought due to their spiritual enlight-
enment, fixed in their vows due to their devotional service and de-
termined to deliver the fallen souls rotting in the material activities.
The fallen souls are very eager to receive novel informations every day,
and the transcendentalists like Vyasadeva or Narada can supply such eager
people in general with unlimited news from the spiritual world. In the
Bhagavad-gita it is said that the material world is only a part of the whole
creation and that this earth is only a fragment of the whole material world.

There are thousands and thousands of literary men all over the world,
and they have created many, many thousands of literary works for the
information of the people in general for thousands and thousands of
years. Unfortunately none of them have brought peace and tranquility on
the earth. This is due to a spiritual vacuum in those literatures; therefore
the Vedic literatures, especially the Bhagavad-gita and the Srimad-
Bhagavatam, are specifically recommended to the suffering humanity to
bring about the desired effect of liberation from the pangs of material
civilization, which is eating the vital part of the human energy. The
Bhagavad-gita is the spoken message of the Lord Himself recorded by
Vyasadeva, and the Srimad-Bhdgavatam is the transcendental narration of
the activities of the same Lord Krsna which alone can satisfy the hanker-
ing desires of the living being for eternal peace and liberation from miseries.
Srimad-Bhagavatam is, therefore, meant for all the living beings all over
the universe for total liberation from all kinds of material bondage. Such


--- Page 248 ---
Text 14] Narada’s Instructions on Srimad-Bhagavatam 239
transcendental narrations of the pastimes of the Lord can only be described
by liberated souls like Vyasadeva and his bona fide representatives who
are completely merged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord.
Only to such devotees do the pastimes of the Lord and their transcenden-
tal nature become automatically manifest by dint of devotional service.
No one else can either know or describe the acts of the Lord, even if they
speculate on the subject for many, many years. The descriptions of the
Bhagavatam are so precise and accurate that whatever has been predicted
in this great literature about 5,000 years before is now exactly happening.
Therefore, the vision of the author comprehends past, present and future.
Such liberated persons like Vyasadeva are not only perfect by the power of
vision and wisdom, but also in aural reception, in thinking, feeling and all
other sense activities. A liberated person possesses perfect senses, and with
perfect senses only can one serve the sense-proprietor, Hrsikeéa, Sr1 Krsna
the Personality of Godhead. Srimad-Bhagavatam is, therefore, the perfect
description of the all-perfect Personality of Godhead by the all-perfect
personality Srila Vyasadeva, the compiler of the Vedas.

240 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 5
‘PURPORT
Sri Vyasadeva is the editor of all descriptions of the Vedic literatures,
and thus he has described transcendental realization in different ways,
namely by fruitive activities, specualtive knowledge, mystic power and
devotional service. Besides that, in his various Puranas he has recommended
the worship of so many demigods in different forms and names. The result
is that people in general are puzzled how to fix up their minds in the ser-
vice of the Lord; they are always disturbed to find out the real path of
self-realization. Srila Naradadeva is stressing this particular defect in the
Vedic literatures compiled by Vyasadeva, and thus he is trying to empha-
size describing everything in relation with the Supreme Lord, and no one
else. In fact, there is nothing existent except the Lord. The Lord is mani-
fested in different expansions. He is the root of the complete tree. He is
the stomach of the complete body. As such, pouring water on the root is
the right process to water the tree, as much as feeding the stomach supplies
energy to all the parts of the body. Srila Vyisadeva should not have com-
piled any Puranas other than the Bhagavata Purana because a slight devia-
tion from that may create havoc for self-realization. If a slight deviation
can create such havoc, then what to speak of deliberate expansion of the
separatist idea from the Absolute Truth Personality of Godhead. The most
defective part of worshiping demigods is that it creates a definite concep-
tion of pantheism, ending disastrously in many religious sects detrimental
to the progress of the principles of the Bhagavatam, which alone can give
the accurate direction for self-realization in eternal relation with the Per-
sonality of Godhead by devotional service in transcendental love. The
example of the boat disturbed by whirling wind is suitable in this respect.
The diverted mind of the pantheist can never reach to the perfection of
self-realization due to the disturbed condition of the selection of object.

TRANSLATION
The people in general are naturally inclined to enjoy, and you have
encouraged them in that way in the name of religion. This is verily con-
demned and is quite unreasonable. Because they are guided under your
instructions, they will accept such activities in the name of religion and
will hardly care for prohibitions.
PURPORT
Srila Vyasadeva’s compilation of different Vedic literatures on the basis
of regulated performances of fruitive activities as depicted in the Maha-
bharata and other literature is condemned herewith by Srila Narada. The
human beings, by long material association, life after life, have a natural
inclination, by practice, to endeavor to lord it over material energy. They
have no sense of the responsibility of human life. This human form of life
is a chance to get out of the clutches of illusory matter. The Vedas are
meant for going back to Godhead, going back home. To revolve in the
cycle of transmigration in a series of lives numbering 8,400,000 is an im-
prisoned life for the condemned conditioned souls. The human form of
life is a chance to get out of this imprisoned life, and as such the only
occupation of the human being is to reestablish his lost relationship with
God. Under the circumstances, one should never be encouraged in making
a plan for sense enjoyment in the name of religious functions. Such diver-
sion of the human energy results in a misguided civilization. Srila Vyasa-
deva is the authority in Vedic explanations in the Mahabharata, etc., and
his encouragement in sense enjoyment in some form or other is a great
barrier for spiritual advancement because the people in general will not
agree to renounce material activities which hold them in material bondage.
At a certain stage of human civilization, such material activities in the name
of religion (as sacrificing animals in the name of yajiia) were too much
rampant. The Lord incarnated Himself as Buddha and decried the authority
of the Vedas to stop animal sacrifice in the name of religion. This was


--- Page 251 ---
242 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 5
foreseen by Narada, and therefore he condemned such literatures. The
flesh-eaters still continue to perform animal sacrifice before some demigod
or goddess in the name of religion because in some of the Vedic literatures
such regulated sacrifice is recommended. They are sp recommended to dis-
courage flesh-eating, but gradually the purpose of such religious activities
is forgotten, and the slaughterhouse becomes prominent. This is because
foolish materialistic men do not care to listen to others who are actually in
a position to explain the Vedic rites.

In the Vedas it is distinctly said that the perfection of life is never to be
attained either by voluminous work, or by accumulation of wealth or even
by increasing the number of population. But it is so attained only by
renunciation. The materialistic men do not care to listen to such injunc-
tions. According to them, the so-called renounced order of life is meant for
those who are unable to earn their livelihood because of some corporeal
defects, or for persons who have failed to achieve prosperity in family life.

In histories like the Mahabharata, of course, there are topics on tran-
scendental subjects along with material topics. The Bhagavad-gita is there
in the Mahabharata. The whole idea of the Mahabhdrata is culminated in
the ultimate instructions of the Bhagavad-gita, that one should relinquish
all other engagements and should engage oneself solely and fully in sur-
rendering unto the lotus feet of Lord Sri Krsna. But men with materialistic
tendencies are more attracted to politics, economics and philanthropic
activities mentioned in the Mahdbhdrata than to the principal topic,
namely the Bhagavad-gita. This compromising spirit of Vyasadeva is
directly condemned by Narada, who advises him to directly proclaim that
the prime necessity of human life is to realize one’s eternal relation with
the Lord and thus surrender unto Him without delay.

A patient suffering from a particular type of malady is almost always
inclined to accept eatables which are forbidden for him. The expert
physician does not make any compromise with the patient by allowing
him to take partially what he should not at all take. In the Bhagavad-gita
it is also said that a man attached to fruitive work should not be discour-
aged from his occupation, for gradually he may be elevated to the position
of self-realization. This is sometimes applicable for those who are only dry
empiric philosophers without spiritual realization. But those who are in
the devotional line need not be always so advised.

The Supreme Lord is unlimited. Only a very expert personality,
retired from the activities of material happiness, deserves to understand
this knowledge of spiritual values. Therefore those who are not so well
situated, due to material attachment, should be shown the ways of
transcendental realization, by your goodness, through descriptions of the
transcendental activities of the Supreme Lord.
PURPORT
Theological science is a difficult subject, especially when it deals with
the transcendental nature of God. It is not a subject matter to be under-
stood by persons who are too much attached to material activities. Only
the very expert, who have almost retired from materialistic activities by
culture of spiritual knowledge, can be admitted to the study of this great
science. In the Bhagavad-gita it is clearly stated that out of many hundreds
and thousands of men only one person deserves to enter into transcendental
realization. And out of many thousands of such transcendentally realized
persons, only a few can understand the theological science specifically
dealing with God as a person. इत Vyasadeva is therefore advised by Narada
to destribe the science of God directly by relating His transcendental
activities. Vyasadeva is himself a personality expert in this science, and he
is unattached to material enjoyment. Therefore he is the right person to
describe it, and Sukadeva Gosvami, the son of Vyasadeva, is the right per-


--- Page 253 ---
244 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 5
son to receive it. Srimad-Bhagavatam is the topmost theological science,
and therefore it can react on the laymen as medicinal doses. Because it
contains the transcendental activities of the Lord, there is no difference
between the Lord and the literature. The literature is the factual literary
incarnation of the Lord. So the laymen can hear the narration of the
activities of the Lord. Thereby they are able to associate with the Lord and
thus gradually become purified from material diseases. The expert devotees
also can discover novel ways and means to convert the nondevotees in
terms of particular time and circumstance. Devotional service is dynamic
activity, and the expert devotees can find out competent means to inject
it into the dull brains of the materialistic population. Such transcendental
activities of the devotees for the service of the Lord can bring a new order
of life to the foolish society of materialistic men. Lord Sra Caitanya
Mahaprabhu and His subsequent followers exhibited expert dexterity in
this connection. By following the same method, one can bring the ma-
terialistic men of this age of quarrel into order for peaceful life and
transcendental realization.

TRANSLATION
One who has forsaken his material occupations to engage in the
devotional service of the Lord may sometimes fall down while in an
immature stage, yet there is no danger of his being unsuccessful. On the
other hand, a nondevotee, though fully engaged in occupational duties,
does not gain anything.
PURPORT
As far as the duties of mankind are concerned, there are innumerable
duties. Every man is duty-bound not only to his parents, family members,
society, country, humanity, other living beings, the demigods, etc., but
also to the great philosophers, poets, scientists, etc. It is enjoined in the
scriptures that one can relinquish all such duties and surrender unto the
service of the Lord. So if one does so and becomes successful in the
discharge of his devotional service unto the Lord, it is well and good. But
it so happens sometimes that one surrenders himself unto the service of
the Lord by some temporary sentiment, and in the long run, due to so
many other reasons, he falls down from the path of service by undesirable
association. There are so many instances of this in the histories. Bharata
Maharaja was obliged to take his birth as a stag due to his intimate attach-
ment to a stag. He thought of this stag when he died. As such, in the next
birth he became a stag, although he did not forget the incidence of his
previous birth. Similarly, Citraketu also fell down due to his offenses at
the feet of Siva. But in spite of all this, the stress is given here to surrender-
ing unto the lotus feet of the Lord, even if there is a chance of falling
down. Because, even though one falls down from the prescribed duties of
devotional service, he will never forget the lotus feet of the Lord. Once
engaged in the devotional service of the Lord, one will continue the service
in all circumstances. In the Bhagavad-gita it is said that even a small quan-
tity of devotional service can save one from the most dangerous position.
There are many instances of such examples in history. Ajamila is one of
them. Ajamila in his early life was a devotee, but in his youth he fell down.
Still he was saved by the Lord at the end.

TRANSLATION
Persons who are actually intelligent and philosophically inclined
should endeavor only for that purposeful end which is not obtainable
even by wandering from the topmost planet [Brahmaloka] down to the
lowest planet [Patala]. As far as happiness derived from sense enjoyment
is concerned, it can be obtained automatically in course of time, just as in
course of time we obtain miseries even though we do not desire them.
PURPORT
Every man everywhere is trying to obtain the greatest amount of sense
enjoyment by various endeavors. Some of them are busy engaged in trade,
industry, economic development, political supremacy, etc., and some of
them are engaged in fruitive work to become happy in the next life by
attaining higher planets. It is said that in the moon the inhabitants are fit
for greater sense enjoyment by drinking soma-rasa, and the Pitrloka is
obtained by good charitable work. So there are various programs for sense
enjoyment, either during this life or in the life after death. Some are trying
to reach the moon or other planets by some mechanical arrangement, for
they are very anxious to get into such planets without doing good work.
But it is not to happen. By the law of the Supreme, different places are
meant for different grades of living beings according to the work they
might have performed. By good work only, as prescribed in the scriptures,


--- Page 256 ---
Text 19] Narada's Instructions on Srimad-Bhagavatam 247
one can obtain birth in a good family, opulence, good education and good
bodily features. We see also that even in this life one obtains a good
education or money or bodily beauty. Similarly, in our next birth we get
such desirable positions only by good work. Otherwise, it would not so
happen that two persons born in the same place, at the same time are seen
differently placed according to previous work. But all such material posi-
tions are not permanent. The positions in the topmost Brahmaloka and in
the lowest Patala are also changeable according to our own work. The
philosophically inclined person must not be tempted by such changeable
positions. He should try to get into the permanent life of bliss and
knowledge where he will not be forced to come back again to the miserable
material world, either in this or that planet. Miseries and mixed happiness
are two features of material life, and they are obtained in Brahmaloka and
in other lokas also. They are obtained in the life of the demigods and also
in the life of the dogs and hogs. The miseries and mixed happiness of all
living beings are only of different degree and quality, but no one is free
from the miseries of birth, death, old age and disease. Similarly, everyone
has his destined happiness also. No one can get more or less of these things
simply by personal endeavors. Even if they are obtained, they can be lost
again. One should not, therefore, waste time with these flimsy things, but
one should only endeavor to go back to Godhead. That should be the
mission of everyone's life.

My dear Vyasa, even though a devotee of Lord Krsna sometimes falls
down somehow or other, he certainly does not undergo material existence
like others [fruitive workers, etc.] because a person who has once relished
the taste of the lotus feet of the Lord can do nothing but remember that
ecstasy again and again. प

PURPORT

A devotee of the Lord automatically becomes uninterested in the en-
chantment of material existence because he is rasa-graha, or one who has
tasted the sweetness of the lotus feet of Lord Krsna. There are certainly
many instances where devotees of the Lord have fallen down due to
uncongenial association, just like fruitive workers, who are always prone to
degradation. But even though he falls down, a devotee is never to be con-
sidered the same as a fallen karmi. A karmi suffers the result of his own
fruitive reactions, whereas a devotee is reformed by chastisement directed
by the Lord Himself. The sufferings of an orphan and the sufferings of a
beloved child of a king are not one and the same. An orphan is really poor
because he has no one to take care of him, but a beloved son of a rich man,
although he appears to be on the same level as the orphan, is always under
the vigilance of his capable father. A devotee of the Lord, due to wrong
association, sometimes imitates the fruitive workers. The fruitive workers
want to lord it over the material world. Similarly, a neophyte devotee
foolishly thinks of accumulating some material power in exchange for
devotional service. Such foolish devotees are sometimes put into difficulty
by the Lord Himself. As a special favor, He may remove all material
paraphernalia. By such action, the bewildered devotee is forsaken by all
friends and relatives, and so he comes to his senses again by the mercy of
the Lord and is set right to execute his devotional service.

In the Bhagavad-gita it is also said that such fallen devotees are given a
chance to take birth in a family of highly qualified brahmanas or in a rich
mercantile family. A devotee in such a position is not as fortunate as one
who is chastised by the Lord and put into a position seemingly of helpless-


--- Page 258 ---
Text 20] Narada’s Instructions on Srimad-Bhagavatam 249
ness. The devotee who becomes helpless by the will of the Lord is more
fortunate than those who are born in good families. The fallen devotees
born in a good family may forget the lotus feet of the Lord because they
are less fortunate, but the devotee who is put into a forlorn condition is
more fortunate because he swiftly returns to the lotus feet of the Lord,
thinking himself helpless all round.

Pure devotional service is so spiritually relishable that a devotee becomes
automatically uninterested in material enjoyment. That is the sign of
perfection in progressive devotional service. A pure devotee continuously
remembers the lotus feet of Lord Sri Krsna and does not forget Him even
for a moment, not even in exchange for all the opulence of the three
worlds.

The Supreme Lord Personality of Godhead is Himself this cosmos,
and still He is aloof from it. From Him only this cosmic manifestation has
emanated, in Him it rests, and unto Him it enters after annihilation. Your
good self knows all about this. I have only given a synopsis.

250 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 5
PURPORT

For a pure devotee, the conception of Mukunda Lord Sri Krsna is both
personal and impersonal. The impersonal cosmic situation is also Mukunda
because it is the emanation of the energy of Mukunda. For example, a tree
is a complete unit, whereas the leaves and the branches of the tree are
emanated parts and parcels of the tree. The leaves and branches of the tree
are also the tree, but the tree itself is neither the leaves nor the branches.
The Vedic version that the whole cosmic creation is nothing but Brahman
means that since everything is emanating from the Supreme Brahman,
nothing is apart from Him. Similarly, the part and parcel hands and legs
are called the body, but the body as the whole unit is neither the hands
nor the legs. The Lord is the transcendental form of eternity, cognition
and beauty. And thus the creation of the energy of the Lord appears to be
partially eternal, full of knowledge and beautiful also. The captivated con-
ditioned souls under the influence of the external energy maya are there-
fore entrapped in the network of the material nature. They accept this as
all in all, for they have no information of the Lord who is the primeval
cause. Nor have they information that the parts and parcels of the body,
being detached from the whole body, are no longer the same hand or leg
as when attached to the body. Similarly, a godless civilization detached
from the transcendental loving service of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead is just like a detached hand or leg. Such parts and parcels may
appear like hands and legs, but they have no efficiency. The devotee of the
Lord, Srila Vyasadeva, knows this very well. He is further advised by Srila
Narada to expand the idea so that the entrapped conditioned souls may
take lessons from him to understand the Supreme Lord as the primeval
cause.

According to the Vedic version, the Lord is naturally fully powerful,
and thus His supreme energies are always perfect and identical with Him.
Both the spiritual and the material skies and their paraphernalia are ema-
nations of the internal and external energies of the Lord. External energy
is comparatively inferior, whereas the internal potency is superior. The
superior energy is living force, and therefore she is completely identical,
but the external energy, being inert, is partially identical. But both the
energies are neither equal to nor greater than the Lord, who is the genera-
tor of all energies; such energies are always under His control, exactly as
electrical energy, however powerful it may be, is always under the control
of the engineer.

The human being and all other living beings are products of His internal


--- Page 260 ---
Text 21] Narada’s Instructions on Srimad-Bhagavatam 251
energies. Thus the living being is also identical with the Lord. But he is
never equal or superior to the Personality of Godhead. The Lord and
living beings are all individual persons. With the help of the material
energies the living beings are also creating something, but none of their
creations are equal or superior to the creations of the Lord. The human
being may create a small playful sputnik and may throw it into outer
space, but that does not mean that he can create a planet like the earth or
moon and float it in the air as the Lord does. Men with a poor fund of
knowledge claim to be equal to the Lord. They are never equal to the
Lord. This is never to be. The human being, after attaining complete
perfection, may achieve a large percentage of the qualities of the Lord
(say up to 78%), but it is never possible to surpass the Lord or to become
equal with Him. In a diseased condition only the foolish being claims to be
one with the Lord and thus becomes misled by the illusory energy. The
misguided living beings, therefore, must accept the supremacy of the Lord
and agree to render loving service to Him. For this they have been created.
Without this, there cannot be any peace or tranquility in the world. Srila
Vyasadeva is advised by Srila Narada to expand thisidea in the Bhagavatam.
In the Bhagavad-gita also the same idea is explained: surrender fully unto
the lotus feet of the Lord. That is the only business of the perfect human
being.

portion of the Lord. Although you are birthless, you have appeared on this
earth for the well-being of all people. Please, therefore, describe the
transcendental pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Sri Krsna
more vividly.
PURPORT

Srila Vyasadeva is the empowered plenary portion incarnation of the
Personality of Godhead Sri Krsna. He descended by his causeless mercy
to deliver the fallen souls in the material world. The fallen and forgotten
souls are detached from the transcendental loving service of the Lord.
The living entities are parts and parcels of the Lord, and they are eternally
servitors of the Lord. All the Vedic literatures are, therefore, put into
systematic order for the benefit of the fallen souls, and it is the duty of
the fallen souls to take advantage of such literatures and be freed from the
bondage of material existence. Although formally Srila Narada Rsi is his
spiritual master, Srila Vyasadeva is not at all dependent on a spiritual
master because in essence he is the spiritual master of everyone else. But
because he is doing the work of an dcdrya, he has taught us by his own
conduct that one must have a spiritual master, even though he be God
Himself. Lord Sri Krsna, Lord SriRamaand Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu,
all incarnations of Godhead, accepted formal spiritual masters, although
by Their transcendental nature They were cognizant of all knowledge.
In order to direct people in general to the lotus feet of Lord Sri Krsna,
He Himself in the incarnation of Vyasadeva is delineating the transcendental
pastimes of the Lord.

TRANSLATION
Learned circles have positively concluded that the infallible purpose
of the advancement of knowledge, namely austerities, study of the Vedas,
sacrifice, chanting of hymns and charity, culminates in the transcendental
descriptions of the Lord, who is defined in choice poetry.
PURPORT

Human intellect is developed for advancement of learning in art, science,
philosophy, physics, chemistry, psychology, economics, politics, etc. By
culture of such knowledge the human society can attain perfection of life.
This perfection of life culminates in the realization of the Supreme Being
Visnu. The Sruti therefore directs that those who are actually advanced in
learning should aspire for the service of Lord Visnu. Unfortunately persons
who are enamored by the external beauty of Visnu-maya do not under-
stand that culmination of perfection or self-realization depends on Visnu.
Visnu-maya means sense enjoyment, which is transient and miserable.
Those who are entrapped by Visnu-maya utilize advancement of knowledge
for sense enjoyment. Sri Narada Muni has explained that all parapharnalia
of the cosmic universe is but an emanation from the Lord out of His
different energies because the Lord has set in motion, by His inconceivable
energy, actions and reactions of the created manifestation. They have come
to be out of His energy, they rest on His energy, and after annihilation
they merge into Him. Nothing is, therefore, different from Him, but at
the same time the Lord is always different from them.

When advancement of knowledge is applied in the service of the Lord,
the whole process becomes absolute. The Personality of Godhead, His


--- Page 263 ---
254 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 5
transcendental name, fame, glory, etc., are all nondifferent from Him.
Therefore, all the sages and devotees of the Lord have recommended that
the subject matter of art, science, philosophy, physics, chemistry, psycholo-
gy and all other branches of knowledge should be wholly and solely
applied in the service of the Lord. Art, literature, poetry, painting, etc.,
may be used in glorifying the Lord. The fiction writers, poets and
celebrated literateurs are generally engaged in writing of sensuous subjects,
but if they turn towards the service of the Lord they can describe the
transcendental pastimes of the Lord. Valmiki was a great poet, and
similarly Vyasadeva is a great writer, and both of them have absolutely
engaged themselves in delineating the transcendental activities of the Lord,
and by doing so they have become immortal. Similarly, science and
philosophy also should be applied in the service of the Lord. There is no
use presenting dry speculative theories for sense gratification. Philosophy
and science should be engaged to establish the glory of the Lord. Advanced
people are eager to understand the Absolute Truth through the medium
of science, and therefore a great scientist should endeavor to prove the
existence of the Lord on a scientific basis. Similarly, philosophical
speculations should be utilized to establish the Supreme Truth as sentient
and all-powerful. Similarly, all other branches of knowledge should always
be engaged in the service of the Lord. In the Bhagavad-gita also the same
is affirmed. All “knowledge” not engaged in the service of the Lord is but
nescience. Real utilization of advanced knowledge is to establish the glories
of the Lord, and that is the real import. Scientific knowledge engaged in
the service of the Lord and all similar activities are all factually Hari-kirtana
or glorification of the Lord.

TRANSLATION
0 Muni, in the last millennium I was born as the son of a certain
maidservant engaged in the service of brahmanas who were following the
principles of Vedanta. When they were living together during the four
months of the rainy season, I was engaged in their personal service.
PURPORT
The wonder of an atmosphere surcharged with devotional service of
the Lord is briefly described herein by Sri Narada Muni. He was the son of
the most insignificant parentage. He was not properly educated. Still, be-
cause his complete energy was engaged in the service of the Lord, he
became an immortal sage. Such is the powerful action of devotional
service. The living entities are the marginal energy of the Lord, and
therefore they are meant for being properly utilized in the transcendental
loving service of the Lord. When this is not done, it is called maya.
Therefore the illusion of maya is at once dissipated as soon as one’s full
energy is converted in the service of the Lord instead of in sense enjoyment.
From the personal example of Sri Narada Muni in his previous birth, it is
clear that the service of the Lord begins with the service of the Lord’s
bona fide servants. The Lord says that the service of His servants is greater
than His personal service. Service of the devotee is more valuable than the
service of the Lord. One should therefore choose a bona fide servant of
the Lord constantly engaged in His service and accept such a servant as the
spiritual master and engage himself in his (the spiritual master’s) service.
Such a spiritual master is the transparent medium by which to visualize the
Lord who is beyond the conception of the material senses. By service of
the bona fide spiritual master, the Lord consents to reveal Himself in
proportion to the service rendered. Utilization of the human energy in the
service of the Lord is the progressive path of salvation. The wholé cosmic
creation becomes at once identical with the Lord as soon as service in
relation with the Lord is rendered under the guidance of a bona fide


--- Page 265 ---
256 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 5
spiritual master. The expert spiritual master knows the art of utilizing
everything to glorify the Lord, and therefore under his guidance the
whole world can be turned into the spiritual abode by the divine grace of
the Lord’s servant.

Although they were impartial by nature, those followers of the
Vedanta blessed me with their causeless mercy. As far as I was concerned,
I was self-controlled and had no attachment for sports, even though I was
a boy. In addition, I was not naughty, and I did not speak more than
required.
PURPORT
In the Bhagavad-gitd the Lord says, “All the Vedas are searching after
Me.” Lord Sri Caitanya says that in the Vedas the subject matters are
only three, namely to establish the relation of the living entities with the
Personality of Godhead, perform the relative duties in devotional service


--- Page 266 ---
Text 25] Narada’s Instructions on Srimad-Bhagavatam 257
and thus achieve the ultimate goal, back to Godhead. As such, Vedanta-
৮৫৫ or the followers of the Vedanta, indicates the pure devotees of the
Personality of Godhead. Such Vedanta-vadi or the bhakti-vedantas are
impartial in distributing the transcendental knowledge of devotional service.
To them no one is enemy or friend; no one is educated or uneducated.
No one is especially favorable, and no one is unfavorable. The bhakti-
vedantas see the people in general are wasting time in false sensuous
things. Their business is to get the ignorant mass of people to reestablish
the lost relationship with the Personality of Godhead. By such endeavor,
even the most forgotten soul is roused up to the sense of spiritual life, and
thus being initiated by the bhakti-vedantas, the people in general gradually
progress on the path of transcendental realization. So the Vedanta-vadis
initiated the boy even before he became self-controlled and was detached
from childish sporting, ctc. But before the initiation, he (the boy) became
more and more advanced in discipline, which is very essential for one who
wishes to make progress in the line. In the system of varpasrama-dharma,
which is the beginning of actual human life, small boys after five years of
age are sent to become brahmacari at the guru’s dsrama where these
things are systematically taught to boys, be they king’s sons or sons of
ordinary citizens. The training was compulsory not only to create good
citizens of the state, but also to prepare the boy’s future life for spiritual
realization. The irresponsible life of sense enjoyment was unknown to the
children of the followers of the varpasrama system. The boy was even
injected with spiritual acumen before being placed by the father in the
womb of the mother. Both the father and the mother were responsible for
the boy’s success in being liberated from the material bondage. That is the
process of successful family planning. It is to beget children for complete
perfection. Without being self-controlled, without being disciplinary and
without being fully obedient, no one can become successful in following
the instructions of the spiritual master, and without doing so, no one is
able to go back to Godhead.

Once only, by their permission, I took the remnants of their food,
and by so doing all my sins were at once eradicated. Thus being engaged,

PURPORT
Pure devotion is as much infectious, in a good sense, as infectious
diseases. A pure devotee is cleared from all kinds of sins. The Personality
of Godhead is the purest entity, and unless one is equally pure from the
infection of material qualities, one cannot become a pure devotee of the
Lord. The bhakti-vedantas as above mentioned were pure devotees, and
the boy became infected with their qualities of purity by their association
and by eating once the remnants of the foodstuff taken by them. Such
remnants may be taken even without permission of the pure devotees.
There are sometimes pseudo-devotees, and one should be very much
cautious about them. There are many things which hinder one from
entering devotional service. But by the association of pure devotees all
these obstacles are removed. The neophyte devotee becomes practically
enriched with the transcendental qualities of the pure devotee, which
means attraction for the Personality of Godhead’s name, fame, quality,
pastimes, etc. Infection of the qualities of the pure devotee means to
imbibe the taste of pure devotion always in the transcendental activities of
the Personality of Godhead. This transcendental taste at once makes all
material things distasteful. Therefore a pure devotee is not at all attracted
by material activities. After the elimination of all sins or obstacles on the


--- Page 268 ---
Text 26) Narada’s Instructions on Srimad-Bhagavatam 259
path of devotional service, one can become attracted, one can have
steadiness, one can have perfect taste, one can have transcendental
emotions, and at last one can be situated on the plane of loving service
of the Lord. All these stages develop by the association of pure devotees,
and that is the purport of this stanza.

Lord Sri Krsna the Absolute Personality of Godhead is not only
attractive in His personal features, but also in His transcendental activities.

as a human being so that human beings attracted towards Him become
able to go back to Godhead. Men are naturally apt to hear histories and
narrations of various personalities performing mundane activities without
knowing that by such association one simply wastes valuable time and also
becomes addicted to the three qualities of mundane nature. Instead of
wasting time one can get spiritual success by turning his attention to the
transcendental pastimes of the Lord. By hearing the narration of the
pastimes of the Lord, one contacts directly the Personality of Godhead,
and, as explained before, by hearing about the Personality of Godhead,
from within, all accumulated sins of the mundane creature are cleared.
Thus being cleared of all sins, the hearer gradually becomes liberated
from mundane association and becomes attracted to the features of the
Lord. Narada Muni has just explained this by his personal experience. The
whole idea is that simply by hearing about the Lord’s pastimes one can
become one of the associates of the Lord. Narada Muni has eternal life,
unlimited knowledge and unfathomed bliss, and he can travel all over the
material and spiritual worlds without restriction. One can attain to the
highest perfection of life simply by attentive hearing of the transcen-
dental pastimes of the Lord from the right sources, as Sri Narada heard
them from the pure devotees (bhakti-vedantas) in his previous life. This
process of hearing in the association of the devotees, is especially recom-
mended in this age of quarrel (Kali).

0 great sage, as soon as I got a taste of the Personality of Godhead,
my attention to hear of the Lord was unflinching. And as my taste
developed, I could realize that it was only in my ignorance that I had
accepted gross and subtle coverings, for both the Lord and I are transcen-
dental.
PURPORT

Ignorance in material existence is compared to darkness, and in all
Vedic literatures the Personality of Godhead is compared to the sun.
Wherever there is light there cannot be darkness. Hearing of the Lord’s
pastimes is itself transcendental association with the Lord because there
is no difference between the Lord and His transcendental pastimes. To
become associated with the supreme light is to dissipate all ignorance.
By ignorance only the conditioned soul wrongly thinks that both he and
the Lord are products of material nature. But in fact the Personality of
Godhead and the living beings are transcendental, and they have nothing
to do with the material nature. When ignorance is removed and it is
perfectly realized that there is nothing existing without the Personality of
Godhead, then nescience is removed. Since the gross and the subtle bodies
are emanations from the Personality of Godhead, the knowledge of light
permits one to engage both of them in the service of the Lord. The gross
body should be engaged in acts of rendering service to the Lord (as in
bringing water, cleansing the temple or making obeisances, etc.). The path
of arcand, or worshiping the Lord in the temple, involves engaging one’s
gross body in the service of the Lord. Similarly, the subtle mind should
be engaged in hearing the transcendental pastimes of the Lord, thinking
about them, chanting His name, etc. All such activities are transcendental.
None of the gross or subtle senses should otherwise be engaged. Such
realization of transcendental activities is made possible by many, many
years of apprenticeship in the devotional service, but simply attraction of
love to the Personality of Godhead, as it was developed in Narada Muni,
by hearing, is highly effective.

TRANSLATION
Thus during two seasons—the rainy season and autumn—I had the
opportunity to hear these great-souled sages constantly chant the un-
adulterated glories of the Lord Hari. As my devotional service began, the
coverings of the modes of passion and ignorance vanished.
PURPORT
Transcendental loving service for the Supreme Lord is the natural
inclination of every living being. The instinct is dormant in everyone, but
due to the association of material nature the modes of passion and
ignorance cover this from time immemorial. If, by the grace of the Lord
and the great-souled devotees of the Lord, a living being becomes fortunate
enough to associate with the unadulterated devotees of the Lord and
gets a chance to hear the unadulterated glories of the Lord, certainly
the flow of devotional service takes place like the flow of a river. As the
river flows on till she reaches the sea, similarly pure devotional service
flows by the association of pure devotees till it reaches the ultimate goal,


--- Page 274 ---
Text 29] Narada’s Instructions on Srimad-Bhagavatam 263
namely, transcendental love of God. Such a flow of devotional service
cannot stop. On the contrary, it increases more and more without limitation.
The flow of devotional service is so potent that any onlooker also becomes
liberated from the influence of the modes of passion and ignorance. These
two qualities of nature are thus removed, and the living being is liberated,
being situated in his original position.

I was very much attached to those sages. I was gentle in behavior,

PURPORT
These are the necessary qualifications of a prospective candidate who
can expect to be elevated to the position of a pure unadulterated devotee.
Such a candidate must seek always the association of pure devotees. One
should not be misled by a pseudo-devotee. He himself must be plain and
gentle to receive the instructions of such a pure devotee. A pure devotee is
a completely surrendered soul unto the Personality of Godhead. He knows
the Personality of Godhead as the supreme proprietor and all others as His
servitors. And by the association of pure devotees only, one can get rid


--- Page 275 ---
264 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 5
of all sins accumulated by mundane association. A neophyte devotee must
faithfully serve the pure devotee, and he should be very much obedient
and strictly follow the instructions. These are the signs of a devotee who is
determined to achieve success even in the existing duration of life.

As they were leaving, those bhakti-vedintas, who are very kind to

PURPORT

A pure Vedantist, or a bhakti-vedanta, instructs followers exactly ac-
cording to the instructions of the Lord Himself. The Personality of
Godhead, both in the Bhagavad-gita and in all other scriptures, has
definitely instructed men to follow the Lord only. The Lord is the
creator, maintainer and annihilator of everything. The whole manifested
creation is existing by His will, and by His will when the whole show will
be finished He will remain in His eternal abode with all His paraphernalia.
Before the creation He was there in the eternal abode, and after the
annihilation He will continue to remain. He is not, therefore, one of the
created beings. He is transcendental. In the Bhagavad-gita the Lord says


--- Page 276 ---
Text 31] Narada’s Instructions on Srimad Bhagavatam 265
that long, long ago, the instruction was imparted to Arjuna, the same was
instructed to the sun-god, and in course of time, the same instruction,
being wrongly handled and being broken, was again reinstructed to Arjuna
because he was His perfect devotee and friend. Therefore, the instruction
of the Lord can be understood by the devotees only and no one else. The
impersonalist, who has no idea of the transcendental form of the Lord,
cannot understand this most confidential message of the Lord. The word
“most confidential” is significant here because knowledge of devotional
service is far, far above knowledge of impersonal Brahman. Jiidnam means
ordinary knowledge or any branch of knowledge. This knowledge develops
up to the knowledge of impersonal Brahman. Above this, when it is
partially mixed with devotion, such knowledge develops to knowledge of
Paramatma, or the all-pervading Godhead. This is more confidential. But
when such knowledge is turned into pure devotional service and the con-
fidential part of transcendental knowledge is attained, it is called the most
confidential knowledge. This most confidential knowledge was imparted
by the Lord to Brahma, Arjuna, Uddhava, etc.

--- Page 277 ---
266 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 5
PURPORT
By devotional service or by the most confidential knowledge, one can
understand very easily how the different energies of the Lord are working.
One part of energy is manifesting the material world; the other (superior)
part of His energy is manifesting the spiritual world. And the via medium
energy is manifesting the living entities who areserving either of the above-
mentioned energies. The living entities serving material energy are struggling
hard for existence and happiness, which is presented to them as illusion.
But those in the spiritual energy are placed under the direct service of the
Lord in eternal life, complete knowledge and perpetual bliss. The Lord
desires, as He has directly said in the Bhagavad-gita, that all conditioned
souls, rotting in the kingdom of material energy, come back to Him by
giving up all engagements in the material world. This is the most confiden-
tial part of knowledge. But this can be understood only by the pure devo-
tees, and only such devotees enter the kingdom of God to see Him person-
ally and serve Him personally. The concrete example is Narada Himself,
who attained this stage of eternal knowledge and eternal bliss. And the
ways and means are open to all, provided one agrees to follow in the foot-
steps of Sri Narada Muni. According to Sruti, the Supreme Lord has un-
limited energies (without effort by Him) and these are described under
three principal headings, as above mentioned.

TRANSLATION
0 Brahmana Vyisadeva, it is decided by the learned that the best
remedial measure for removing all troubles and miseries is to dedicate
one’s activities to the service of the Supreme Lord Personality of Godhead
[Sri Krsna].
PURPORT
Sri Narada Muni personally experienced that the most feasible and
practical way to open the path of salvation or get relief from ali miseries
of life is to hear submissively the transcendental activities of the Lord from
the right and bona fide sources. This is the only remedial process. The
entire material existence is full of miseries. Foolish people have manu-
factured, out of their tiny brains, many remedial measures for removing
the threefold miseries pertaining to the body and mind, pertaining to the
natural distrubances and in relation with other living beings. The whole
world is struggling very hard to exist out of these miseries, but men do not
know that without the sanction of the Lord no plan or no remedial mea-
sure can actually bring about the desired peace and tranquility. The re-
medial measure to cure a patient by medical treatment is useless if it is
not sanctioned by the Lord. To cross the river or the ocean by a suitable
boat is no remedial measure if it is not sanctioned by the Lord. We should
know for certain that the Lord is the ultimate sanctioning officer, and we
must therefore dedicate our attempts to the mercy of the Lord for ultimate
success or to get rid of the obstacles on the path of success. The Lord is
all-pervading, all-powerful, omniscient and omnipresent. He is the ultimate
sanctioning agent of all good or bad effects. We should, therefore, learn
to dedicate our activities unto the mercy of the Lord and accept Him
either as impersonal Brahman, localized Paramatma or the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead. It does not matter what one is. One must dedicate
everything in the service of the Lord. If one is a learned scholar, scientist,
philosopher, poet, etc., then he should employ his learning to establish
the supremacy of the Lord. Try to study the energy of the Lord in every
sphere of life. Do not decry Him and try to become like Him or take His
position simply by fragmental accumulation of knowledge. If one is an
administrator, statesman, warrior, politician, etc., then one should try to
establish the Lord’s supremacy in statesmanship. Fight for the cause of the
Lord as Sri Arjuna did. In the beginning, Sri Arjuna, the great fighter, de-


--- Page 279 ---
268 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 5
clined to fight, but when he was convinced by the Lord that the fighting
was necessary, Sei Arjuna changed his decision and fought for His cause.
Similarly, if one is a businessman, an industrialist, an agriculturist, etc.,
then one should spend his hard-earned money for the cause of the Lord.
Think always that the money which is accumulated is the wealth of the
Lord. Wealth is considered to be the goddess of fortune (Laksmi), and the
Lord is Narayana or the husband of Laksmi. Try to engage Laksmi in the
service of Lord Narayana and be happy. That is the way to realize the
Lord in every sphere of life. The best thing is, after all, to get relief from
all material activities and engage oneself completely in hearing the tran-
scendental pastimes of the Lord. But in case of the absence of such an
opportunity, one should try to engage everything, for which one has
specific attraction, in the service of the Lord, and that is the way of peace
and prosperity. The word sarmsitcitam in this stanza is also significant. One
should not think for a moment that the realization of Narada was childish
imagination only. It is not like that. It is so realized by the expert and
erudite scholars, and that is the real import of the word samsiicitam.

An expert physician treats his patient with a therapeutic diet. For exam-

--- Page 280 ---
Text 34] Narada’s Instructions on Srimad-Bhagavatam 269
very same milk converted into curd and mixed with some other remedial
ingredients cures such disorders. Similarly, the threefold miseries of mate-
rial existence cannot be mitigated simply by material activities. Such
activities have to be spiritualized, just as by fire iron is made red-hot, and
thereby the action of fire begins. Similarly, the material conception of a
thing is at once changed as soon as it is put into the service of the Lord.
That is the secret of spiritual success. We should not try to lord it over the
material nature, nor should we reject material things. The best way to make
the best use of a bad bargain is to use everything in relation with the su-
preme spiritual being. Everything is an emanation from the supreme spirit,
and by His inconceivable power He can convert spirit into matter and
matter into spirit. Therefore a material thing (so-called) is at once turned
into a spiritual force by the great will of the Lord. The necessary condi-
tion for such a change is to employ so-called matter in the service of the
spirit. That is the way to treat our material discases and elevate ourselves
to the spiritual plane where there is no misery, no lamentation and no fear.
When everything is thus employed in the service of the Lord, we can ex-
perience that there is nothing except the Supreme Brahman. The Vedic
mantra that “everything is Brahman is thus realized by us.

--- Page 281 ---
270 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 5
PURPORT

Fruitive work which has perpetually engaged the living being is com-
pared with the banyan tree in the Bhagavad-gita, for it is certainly very
deeply rooted. As long as the propensity for enjoying the fruit of work is
there, one has to continue the transmigration of the soul from one body or
place according to one’s nature of work. The propensity for enjoyment
may be turned into the desire for serving the mission of the Lord. By doing
80, one’s activity is changed into karma-yoga, or the way by which one can
attain spiritual perfection while engaging in the work for which he has a
natural tendency. Here the word atmd indicates the categories of all
fruitive work. The conclusion is that when the result of all fruitive and
other work is dovetailed with the service of the Lord, it will cease to gen-
erate further karma and will gradually develop into transcendental devo-
tional service, which will not only cut off completely the root of the banyan
tree of work but will also carry the performer to the lotus feet of the Lord.

The summary is that one has to, first of all, seek the association of pure
devotees who are not only learned in the Vedanta but are self-realized souls
and unalloyed devotees of Lord Sri Krsna the Personality of Godhead. In
that association, the neophyte devotees must render loving service physi-
cally and mentally without reservation. This serivce attitude will induce
the great souls to be more favorable in bestowing their mercy, which
injects the neophyte with all the transcendental qualities of the pure
devotees. Gradually this is developed into a strong attachment to hearing
the transcendental pastimes of the Lord, which makes him able to catch
up the constitutional position of the gross and subtle bodies and beyond
them the knowledge of pure soul and his eternal relation with the Supreme
Soul, the Personality of Godhead. After the relation is ascertained by
establishment of the eternal relation, pure devotional service of the Lord
begins gradually developing into perfect knowledge of the Personality of
Godhead beyond the purview of impersonal Brahman and localized Param-
atma. By such Purusottama-yoga, as it is stated in the Bhagavad-gita, one
is made perfect even during the present corporeal existence, and one
exhibits all the good qualities of the Lord to the highest percentage. Such
is the gradual development by association of pure devotees.

TRANSLATION
Whatever work is done here in this life for the satisfaction of the
mission of the Lord is called bhakti-yoga, or transcendental loving service
of the Lord, and what is called knowledge becomes a concomitant factor.
PURPORT
The general and popular notion is that by discharging fruitive work in
terms of the direction of the scriptures one becomes perfectly able to
acquire transcendental knowledge for spiritual realization. Bhakti-yoga is
considered by some to be another form of karma. But factually bhakti-
yoga is above both karma and jiiana. Bhakti-yoga is independent of jiiana
or karma; on the other hand, [0610 and karma are dependent of bhakti-
yoga. This kriyd-yoga or karma-yoga, as recommended by Sri Narada to
Vyasa, is specifically recommended because the principle is to satisfy the
Lord. The Lord does not want His sons, the living beings, to suffer the
threefold miseries of life. He desires that all of them come to Him and
live with Him, but going back to Godhead means that one must purify
himself from material infections. When work is, therefore, performed to
satisfy the Lord, the performer becomes gradually purified from the mate-
rial affection. This purification means attainment of spiritual knowledge.
Therefore knowledge is dependent on such karma or work which is done
on behalf of the Lord. Other knowledge, being devoid of bhakti-yoga or
satisfaction of the Lord, cannot lead one back to the kingdom of God,
which means that it cannot even offer salvation as is already explained in
connection with the stanza, naiskarmyam apy acyuta-bhava-varjitam, etc.
The conclusion is that a devotee engaged in the unalloyed service of the
Lord, specifically in hearing and chanting of His transcendental glories,


--- Page 283 ---
272 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 5
becomes simultaneously spiritually enlightened by the divine grace, as it
is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita.

TRANSLATION
While performing duties according to the order of इत Krsna, the

names and qualities.
PURPORT

An expert devotee of the Lord can mold his life in such a way that while
performing all kinds of duties either for this or the next life, he can con-
stantly remember the Lord’s name, fame, qualities, etc. The order of the
Lord is distinctly there in the Bhagavad-gita: one should work only for the
Lord in all spheres of life. In every sphere of life the Lord should be
situated as the proprietor. According to the Vedic rites, even in the wor-
ship of some demigods like Indra, Brahma, Sarasvati, Ganesa, the system is
that in all circumstances the representation of Visnu must be there as the
yajiiesvara, or the controlling power of such sacrifices. It is recommended
that a particular demigod be worshiped for a particular purpose, but still
the presence of Visnu is compulsory in order to make the function proper.

Apart from such Vedic duties, even in our ordinary dealings (for exam-
ple, in our household affairs or in our business or profession) we must
consider that the result of all activities must be given over to the supreme


--- Page 284 ---
Text 36] Narada’s Instructions on Srimad-Bhagavatam 273
enjoyer Lord Krsna. In the Bhagavad-gita the Lord has declared Himself to
be the supreme enjoyer of everything, as the supreme proprietor of every
planet and the supreme friend of all beings. Except Lord Sri Krsna, no one
else can claim to be the proprietor of everything within His creation. A pure
devotee remembers this constantly, and in doing so he repeats the tran-
scendental name, fame and qualities of the Lord, which means that he is
constantly in touch with the Lord. The Lord is identical with His name,
fame, etc., and therefore to be associated with His name, fame, etc.,
constantly, means actually to associate with the Lord.

The major portion of our monetary income, not less than fifty percent,
must be spent to carry out the order of Lord Krsna. We should not only
give the profit of our earning to this cause, but we must also arrange to
preach this cult of devotion to others because that is also one of the orders
of the Lord. The Lord definitely says that no one is more dear to Him than
one who is always engaged in the preaching work of the Lord’s name and
fame all over the world. The scientific discoveries of the material world
can also be equally engaged in carrying out His order. He wants the message
of the Bhagavad-gita to be preached amongst His devotees. It may not be
so done amongst those who have no credit of austerities, charity, educa-
tion, etc. Therefore, the attempt must go on to convert unwilling men to
become His devotees. Lord Caitanya has taught a very simple method in
this connection. He has taught the lesson for preaching the transcendental
message through singing, dancing and refreshment. As such, fifty percent
of our income may be spent for this purpose. In this fallen age of quarrel
and dissension, if only the leading and wealthy persons of society agree to
spend fifty percent of their income in the service of the Lord, as it is
taught by Lord इत Caitanya Mahaprabhu, there is absolute certainty of
converting this hell of pandemonium to the transcendental abode of the
Lord. No one will disagree to partake in a function where good singing,
dancing and refreshment are administered. Everyone will attend such a
function, and everyone is sure to feel individually the transcendental
presence of the Lord. This alone will help the attendant associate with the
Lord and thereby purify himself in spiritual realization. The only condition
for successfully executing such spiritual activities is that they must be
conducted under the guidance of a pure devotee who is completely free
from all mundane desires, fruitive activities and dry speculations about the
nature of the Lord. No one has to discover the nature of the Lord. It is
already spoken by the Lord Himself in the Bhagavad-gitd especially and in
all other Vedic literatures generally. We have simply to accept them in toto
and abide by the orders of the Lord. That will guide us to the path of


--- Page 285 ---
274 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 5
perfection. One can remain in his own position. No one has to change his
position, especially in this age of variegated difficulties. The only condition
is that one must give up the habit of dry speculation to become one with
the Lord. And after giving up such lofty puffed up vanities, one may very
submissively receive the orders of the Lord in the Bhagavad-gita or
Bhagavatam from the lips of a bona fide devotee whose qualification is
mentioned above. That will make everything successful, without a doubt.

According to Paiicaratra, Narayana is the primeval cause of all expan-

Aniruddha. Vasudeva and Sankarsana are on the middle left and right,
Pradyumna is on the right of Sankarsana, and Aniruddha is on the left of
Vasudeva, and thus the four Deities are situated. They are known as the
four aides-de-camp of Lord Sri-Krsna.
This is a Vedic hymn or mantra beginning with omkara prapava, and
thus the mantra is established by the transcendental chanting process,
namely, om namo dhimahi, etc.

Text 38] Narada’s Instructions on Srimad-Bhagavatam 275

The purport is that any transaction, either in the field of fruitive work
or empiric philosophy, which is not ultimately aimed at transcendental
realization of the Supreme Lord, is considered to be useless. Naradaji has
therefore explained the nature of unalloyed devotional service by his
personal experience in the development of intimacy between the Lord and
the living entity by gradual process of progressive devotional activities.
Such a progressive march of transcendental devotion for the Lord cul-
minates in the attainment of loving service of the Lord, which is called
prema in different transcendental variegatedness called rasas (tastes). Such
devotional service is also executed in mixed forms, namely mixed with
fruitive work or empiric philosophical speculations.

Now the question which was raised by the great rsis headed by Saunaka
regarding the confidential part of 30185 achievement through the spiritual
master is explained herein by chanting this hymn consisting of thirty-
three letters. And this mantra is addressed to the four Deities or the Lord
with His plenary expansions. The central figure is Lord Sri Krsna because
the plenary portions are His aides-de-camp. The most confidential part of
the instruction is that one should always chant and remember the glories
of the Lord Sri Krsna the Supreme Personality of Godhead along with His
different plenary portions expanded as Vasudeva, Sarikarsana, Pradyumna
and Aniruddha. These expansions are the original Deities for all other
truths, namely either Visnu-tattva or Sakti-tattvas.

276 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 5
TRANSLATION
Thus he is the actual seer who worships, in the form of transcendental
sound representation, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu, who
has no material form.
PURPORT

Our present senses are all made of material elements, and therefore they
are imperfect to realize the transcendental form of Lord Visnu. He is
therefore worshiped by sound representation via the transcendental method
of chanting. Anything which is beyond the scope of experience by our
imperfect senses can be realized fully by the sound representation. A
person transmitting sound from a far distant place can be factually
experienced. If this is materially possible, why not spiritually? This
experience is not a vague impersonal experience. But it is actually an
experience of the transcendental Personality of Godhead who possesses
the pure form of eternity, bliss and knowledge. In the Amarako$a Sanskrit
dictionary the word miirti carries import in twofold meanings, namely,
form and difficulty.

Therefore amirtikam is explained by Acarya Sri Visvanatha Cakravarti
Thakur as meaning without difficulty. The transcendental form of eternal
bliss and knowledge can be experienced by our original spiritual senses
which can be revived by chanting of the holy mantras or transcendental
sound representations. Such sound should be received from the trans
parent agency of the bona fide spiritual master, and the chanting may be
practiced by the direction of the spiritual master. That will gradually lead
us nearer to the Lord. This method of worship is recommended in the
Paiicaratrika system, which is both recognized and authorized. The Paii-
caratrika system has the most authorized codes for transcendental devo-
tional service. Without the help of such codes, one cannot approach the
Lord, certainly not by dry philosophical speculation. The Paiicaratrika
system is both practical and suitable for this age of quarrel. The Paii-
caritra is more important than the Vedanta for this modern age.

TRANSLATION
O brahmana, thus by the Supreme Lord Krsna I was endowed first
with the transcendental knowledge of the Lord as inculcated in the confi-
dential parts of the Vedas, then with the spiritual opulences, and then
with His intimate loving service.
PURPORT

Communion with the Lord by transmission of the transcendental sound
is nondifferent from the whole spirit Lord Sri Krsna. It is a completely
perfect method for approaching the Lord. By such pure contact with the
Lord, without offense of material conceptions (numbering ten), the
devotee can rise above the material plane to understand the inner meaning
of the Vedic literatures, including the 1,010 5 existence in the transcendental
realm. The Lord reveals His identity gradually to one who has unflinching
faith, both in the spiritual master and in the Lord. After this, the devotee
is endowed with mystic opulences, which are eight in number. And above
all, the devotee is accepted in the confidential entourage of the Lord and
is entrusted with specific service of the Lord through the agency of the
spiritual master. A pure devotee is more interested in serving the Lord
than in showing an exhibition of the mystic powers dormant in him. Sri
Narada has explained all these from his personal experience, and one can
obtain all the facilities which Sri Narada obtained by perfecting the
chanting process of the sound representation of the Lord. There is no bar
for chanting this transcendental sound by anyone, provided it is received
through Narada’s representative, coming down by the chain of disciplic
succession, or the parampara system.

TRANSLATION
Please, therefore, describe the Almighty Lord's activities which you
have learned by your vast knowledge of the Vedas, for that will satisfy the
hankerings of great learned men and at the same time mitigate the miseries
of the masses of common people who are always suffering from material
pangs. Indeed, there is no other way to get out of such miseries.
PURPORT
Sri Narada Muni from practical experience definitely asserts that the
prime solution of all problems of material work is to broadcast very widely
the transcendental glories of the Supreme Lord. There are four classes of
good men, and there are four classes of bad men also. The four classes of
good men acknowledge the authority of the Almighty God, and therefore
such good men when 1) they are in difficulty, 2) when they are in need of
money, 3) when they are advanced in knowledge and 4) when they are
inquisitive to know more and more about God, intuitively take shelter of
the Lord. As such, Naradaji advises Vyasadeva to broadcast the transcen-


--- Page 290 ---
Text 40] Narada’s Instructions on Srimad-Bhagavatam 279
dental knowledge of God in terms of the vast Vedic knowledge which he
had already attained.

As far as the bad men are concerned, they are also four in number:
1) those who are simply addicted to the mode of progressive fruitive work
and thus are subjected to the accompanying miseries, 2) those who are
simply addicted to vicious work for sense satisfaction and so suffer the
consequence, 3) those who are materially very much advanced in knowl-
edge but have no sense to acknowledge the authority of the Almighty
Lord and thus suffer a lot, and 4) the class of men who are known as
atheists and therefore purposely hate the very name of God, although
हल are always in difficulty.

rm Naradaji advised Vyasadeva to describe the glories of the Lord just
to do good to all the eight classes of men, both good and bad. Srimad-
Bhagavatam is therefore not meant for any particular class of men or sect.
It is for the sincere soul who wants actually his own welfare and peace
of mind.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the First Canto, Fifth Chapter,
of Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “Sri Narada’s Instructions on Srimad-
Bhagavatam for Vyasadeva.”

birth in scientific transcendental knowledge?
PURPORT
Vyasadeva himself was the disciple of Naradaji, and therefore it is
natural to be anxious to hear what he did after initiation from the spiritual
master. He wanted to follow in Narada’s footsteps in order to attain to
the same perfect stage of life. This desire to inquire from the spiritual
master is an essential factor to the progressive path. This process is
technically known as sat-dharma precha.

Sri Narada Muni in his previous life was just an ordinary maidservant’s
son, so how he became so perfectly transformed into the spiritual body of
eternal life, bliss and knowledge was certainly important. Sri Vyasadeva
desired him to disclose the facts for everyone's satisfaction.

--- Page 294 ---
284 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 6
PURPORT
As spirit is not annihilated even after the annihilation of the material
body, so also spiritual consciousness is not annihilated. Sri Narada de-
veloped this spiritual consciousness even when he had his material body
in the previous kalpa. Consciousness of the material body means spiritual
consciousness expressed through the medium of a material body. This
consciousness is inferior, destructible and perverted. But super conscious-
ness of the supramind in the spiritual plane is as good as the spirit soul
and is never annihilated.

association of devotees brings about a quick change in life for spiritual
realization. How it so acted upon the previous life of Sri Narada Muni is
described by and by in this chapter.

milk a cow, was bitten on the leg by a serpent, influenced by supreme
time.

That is the way of dragging a sincere soul nearer to God. The poor boy
was being looked after only by his affectionate mother, and yet the
mother was taken from the world by the supreme will in order to put him
completely at the mercy of the Lord.

TRANSLATION
I took this as the special mercy of the Lord, who always desires
benediction for His devotees, and so thinking, I started for the north.
PURPORT
Confidential devotees of the Lord see in.every step a benedictory
direction of the Lord. What is considered to be an odd or difficult moment
in the mundane sense is accepted as special mercy of the Lord. Mundane
prosperity is a kind of material fever, and by the grace of the Lord the
temperature of this material fever is gradually diminished, and spiritual
health is obtained step by step. Mundane people misunderstand it.

TRANSLATION
After my departure, I passed through many flourishing metropolises,

PURPORT
Man’s activities in the fields of agriculture, mining, farming, industries,
gardening, etc., were all on the same scale as they are now, even previous to
the present creation, and the same activities will remain as they are, even in
the next creation. After many hundreds of millions of years, one creation
is started by the law of nature, and the history of the universe repeats
itself practically in the same way. The mundane wranglers waste time with
archeological excavations without searching into the vital necessities of
life. Sri Narada Muni, even though he was a mere child, after getting an
impetus in spiritual life, did not waste time for a single moment with
economic development, although he passed towns and villages, mines and
industries. He continually went on to progressive spiritual emancipation.
Srimad-Bhagavatam is the repetition of a history which happened some
hundreds of millions of years before. As it is said herein, only the most
important factors of history are picked up to be recorded in this tran-
scendental literature.

I then passed alone through many forests of bamboo, sharp grass,
weeds and caves, which were very difficult to go through alone. I visited
deep, dark and dangerously fearful forests, which were the play yards of
snakes, owls and jackals.
PURPORT
It is the duty of a mendicant (parivrdjakdcarya) to experience all
varieties of God’s creation by travelling alone through all forests, hills,
towns, villages, etc., to gain faith in God and strength of mind as well as to
enlighten the inhabitants with the message of God. A sannydsi is duty-
bound to take all these risks without fear, and the most typical sannydsi of
the present age is Lord Caitanya, who travelled in the same manner through
the central Indian jungles, enlightening even the tigers, bears, snakes, deers,
elephants and many other jungle animals. In this age of Kali, sannydsa is
forbidden for ordinary men. One who changes his dress to make propaganda
is a different man from the original ideal sannydsi. One should, however,
take the vow to stop social intercourse completely and devote life exclu-
sively to the service of the Lord. The change of dress is only a formality.
Lord Caitanya did not accept the name of a sannydsi, and in this age of
Kali the so-called sannydsis should not change their former names, follow-
ing in the footsteps of Lord Caitanya. In this age devotional service of
hearing and repeating the holy glories of the Lord is strongly recommended,
and one who takes the vow of renunciation of family life need not imitate
the parivrajakacarya like Narada or Lord Caitanya, but may sit down at
some holy place and devote his whole time and energy to hear and re-
peatedly chant the holy scriptures left by the great acaryas like the six
Gosvamis of Vrndavana.

Thus travelling, I felt tired, both bodily and mentally, and I was both
thirsty and hungry. So I took a bath in a river lake and also drank water.
By contacting water, I got relief from my exhaustion.
PURPORT
A travelling mendicant can meet the needs of body, namely thirst and
hunger, by the gifts of nature without being a beggar at the doors of the
householders. The mendicant therefore does not go to the house of a
householder to beg but to enlighten him spiritually.

After that, under the shadow of a banyan tree in an uninhabited

PURPORT
One should not meditate according to one’s personal whims. One should
know perfectly well from the authoritative sources of scriptures through
the transparent medium of a bona fide spiritual master and by proper use
of one’s trained intelligence for meditating upon the Supersoul dwelling
within every living being. This consciousness is firmly developed by a
devotee who has rendered loving service unto the Lord by carrying out
the orders of the spiritual master. Sri Naradaji contacted a bona fide
spiritual master, served him sincerely and got enlightenment rightly. Thus
he began to meditate. #

Text 17] Conversation Between Narada and Vyasa 293
PURPORT

The word bhava is significant here. This bhava stage is attained after one
has transcendental affection for the Lord. The first initial stage is called
$raddha, or a liking for the Supreme Lord, and in order to increase that
liking one has to associate with pure devotees of the Lord. The third stage
is to practice the prescribed rules and regulations of devotional service.
This will dissipate all sorts of misgivings and remove all personal defi-
ciencies that hamper progress in devotional service.

When all misgiving and personal deficiencies are removed, there is a
standard faith in transcendental matter, and the taste for it increases in
greater proportion. This stage leads to attraction, and after this there is
bhava, or the prior stage of unalloyed love for God. All the above different
states are but different stages of development of transcendental love. Being
so surcharged with transcendental love, there comes a strong feeling of
separation which leads to eight different kinds of ecstasies. Tears from the
eyes of a devotee is an automatic reaction, and because Sri Narada Muni
in his previous birth attained that stage very quickly after his departure
from home, it was quite possible for him to perceive the actual presence
of the Lord, which he tangibly experienced by his developed spiritual
senses without material tinge.

PURPORT
Spiritual feeling of happiness and intense ecstasies have no mundane
comparison. Therefore itis very difficult to give expression to such feelings.
We can just have a glimpse of such ecstasy in the words of Sri Narada Muni.
Each and every part of the body or senses has its particular function. After
seeing the Lord, all the senses become fully awakened to render service
unto the Lord because in the liberated state the senses are fully efficient
in serving the Lord. As such, in that transcendental ecstasy it so happened
that the senses became separately enlivened to serve the Lord. This being
80, Narada Muni lost himself in seeing both himself and the Lord simul-
taneously.

The transcendental form of the Lord, as it is, manifests according to

that form, I suddenly got up, being perturbed, as is usual when one loses
that which is desirable.
PURPORT
That the Lord is not formless is experienced by Narada Muni. But His
form is completely different from all forms of our material experience. For
the whole duration of our life we go see different forms in the material
world, but none of them is just apt to satisfy the mind, nor can any one of


--- Page 305 ---
Text 19] Conversation Between Narada and Vyasa 295
them vanish all perturbance of the mind. These are the special features of
the transcendental form of the Lord, and one who has once seen that
form is not satisfied with anything else, and no form in the material world
can any longer satisfy the seer. Formless means nothing like material form.
Nor is He like any material personality.

As spiritual beings, having eternal relations with that transcendental
form of the Lord, we are, life after life, searching after that form of the
Lord, and we are not satisfied by any other form of material appeasement.
Narada Muni got a glimpse of this, but having not seen it again he became
perturbed and stood up all of a sudden to search it out. What we desire
life after life was obtained by Narada Muni, and losing sight of Him again
was certainly a great shock for him.

very much aggrieved.
PURPORT

There is no mechanical process to see the form of the Lord. It com-
pletely depends on the canseless mercy of the Lord. We cannot demand
the Lord to be present before our vision just as we cannot demand the sun


--- Page 306 ---
296 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 6
to rise up whenever we like. The sun rises out of his own accord; so also
the Lord is pleased to be present out of His causeless mercy. One should
simply await the opportune moment and go on discharging his prescribed
duty in devotional service of the Lord. Narada Muni thought that the Lord
could be seen again by the same mechanical process which was successful
in the first attempt, but in spite of his utmost endeavor he could not make
the second attempt successful again. The Lord is completely independent
of all obligations. He can simply be bound up by the tie of unalloyed devo-
tion. Nor is He visible or perceivable by our material senses. When He
pleases, being satisfied with the sincere attempt of devotional service
depending completely on the mercy of the Lord, then He may be seen out
of His own accord.

In the Vedas it is said that God is beyond the approach of mundane
words and intelligence. And yet by His causeless mercy one can have
suitable senses to hear Him or to speak to Him. This is the Lord’s incon-
ceivable energy. One can hear Him upon whom His mercy is bestowed.

Text 21] Conversation Between Narada and Vyasa 297
The Lord was much pleased with Narada Muni, and therefore the necessary
strength was invested in him so that he could hear the Lord. It is not,
however, possible for others to perceive directly the touch of the Lord
during the probation stage of regulative devotional service. It was a special
gift for Narada. When he heard the pleasing words of the Lord, the feelings
of separation were to some extent mitigated. A devotee in love with God
feels always the pangs of separation and is therefore always enwrapped in
transcendental ecstasy.

TRANSLATION
0 Narada [the Lord spoke], I regret that during this lifetime you will
not be able to see Me any more. Those who are incomplete in service and
who are not completely free from all material taints can hardly see Me.
PURPORT

The Personality of Godhead is described in the Bhagavad-gita as the
most pure, the Supreme and the Absolute Truth. There is no trace of a
tinge of materiality in His person, and thus one who has the slightest tinge
of material affection cannot approach Him. The beginning of devotional
service starts from the point when one is freed from at least two forms of
material modes, namely the mode of passion and the mode of ignorance.
The result is exhibited by the signs of being freed from kama (lust) and
lobha (covetousness). That is to say, one must be freed from the desires


--- Page 308 ---
298 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 6
for sense satisfaction and avarice for sense gratification. The balanced
mode of nature is goodness. And to be completely freed from all material
tinges is to become free from the modes of goodness also. To search the
audience of God in a lonely forest is considered to be in the mode of
goodness. One can go out into the forest to attain spiritual perfection, but
that does not mean that one can see the Lord personally there. One must
be completely freed from all material attachment and be situated on the
plane of transcendence, which alone will help the devotee get in personal
touch with the Personality of Godhead. The best method is that one
should live at a place where the transcendental form of the Lord is wor-
shiped. The temple of the Lord is a transcendental place, whereas the
forest is a materially good habitation. A neophyte devotee is always
recommended to worship the Deity of the Lord (arcana) rather than go
into the forest to search out the Lord. Devotional service begins from the
process of arcand, which is better than going out in the forest. In his
present life, which is completely freed from all material hankerings, Sri
Narada Muni does not go into the forest, although he can turn every
place into Vaikuntha by his presence only. He travels from one planet to
another to convert men, gods, Kinnaras, Gandharvas, rsis, munis and all
others to become devotees of the Lord. By his activities he has engaged
many devotees like Prahlada Maharaja, Dhruva Maharaja and many others
in the transcendental service of the Lord. A pure devotee of the Lord,
therefore, follows in the footsteps of the great devotees like Narada,
Prahlada, etc., and engages his whole time in glorifying the Lord by the
process of kirtana. Such a preaching process is transcendental to all
material qualities.

Text 23] Conversation Between Narada and Vyasa 299
TRANSLATION
O virtuous one, you have only once seen My person, and this is just
to increase your desire for Me, because the more you hanker for Me, the
more you will be freed from all material desires.
PURPORT
A living being cannot be vacant of desires. He is not a dead stone. He
must be working, thinking, feeling and willing. But when he thinks, feels
and wills materially, he becomes entangled, and conversely when he thinks,
feels and wills for the service of the Lord, he becomes gradually freed from
all entanglement. The more a person is engaged in the transcendental
loving service of the Lord, the more he acquires a hankering for it. That is
the transcendental nature of godly service. Material service has satiation,
whereas spiritual service of the Lord has neither satiation nor end. One can
go on increasing his hankerings for the loving transcendental service of the
Lord, and yet he will not find satiation nor end. By intense service of the
Lord, one can experience the presence of the Lord transcendentally.
Therefore seeing the Lord means being engaged in His service because His
service and His person are identical. The sincere devotee should go on
with sincere service of the Lord. The Lord will give proper direction as to
how and where it has to be done. There was no material desire in Narada,
and yet just to increase his intense desire for the Lord, he was so advised.

TRANSLATION
By service of the Absolute Truth, even for a few days, a devotee
attains firm and fixed intelligence in Me. Consequently he goes on to
become My associate in the transcendental world after giving up the
present deplorable material worlds.
PURPORT
Service of the Absolute Truth involves rendering service unto the
Absolute Personality of Godhead under the direction of the bona fide
spiritual master who is a transparent via media between the Lord and
the neophyte devotee. The neophyte devotee has no capacity to approach
the Absolute Personality of Godhead by the strength of his present imper-
fect material senses, and therefore under the direction of the spiritual
master he is trained in transcendental service of the Lord. And by such
training, even for some days, the neophyte devotee gets intelligence in
such transcendental service, which leads him ultimately to get free from
perpetual inhabitation in the material worlds and to be promoted to the
transcendental world to become one of the liberated associates of the Lord
in the kingdom of God.

Devotional service rendered to the Personality of Godhead never goes in
vain. Since the Personality of Godhead is eternal, intelligence applied in
His service or anything done in His relation is also permanent. In the
Bhagavad-gita it is said that such transcendental service rendered unto the
Personality of Godhead accumulates birth after birth, and when the
devotee is fully matured, the total service counted together makes him
eligible to enter into the association of the Personality of Godhead. Such
accumulation of God’s service is never vanquished, but increases till fully
matured.

make any difference. The Personality of Godhead produced the four Vedas


--- Page 312 ---

by His breathing, and He is seen and realized through the transcendental
sound of the Vedas. Similarly, the Bhagavad-gita is the sound representa-
tion of the Lord, and there is no difference in identity. The conclusion is
that the Lord can be seen and heard by persistently chanting the transcen-
dental sound.

Thus I began chanting the holy name and fame of the Lord by
repeated recitation, ignoring all the formalities of the material world. Such
chanting and remembering of the transcendental pastimes of the Lord are
benedictory. So doing, I travelled all over the earth, fully satisfied, humble
and unenvious.
PURPORT
The life of a sincere devotee of the Lord is thus explained in a nutshell
by Narada Muni by his personal example. Such a devotee, after his initia-
tion by the Lord or His bona fide representative, takes very seriously


--- Page 313 ---
Text 27] Conversation Between Narada and Vyasa 303
chanting of the glories of the Lord and travelling all over the world so that
others may also hear the glories of the Lord. Such devotees have no desire
for material gain. They are conducted by one single desire: to go back to
Godhead. This awaits them in due course on quitting the material body.
Because they have the highest aim of life, going back to Godhead, they are
never envious of anyone, nor are they proud of being eligible to go back
to Godhead. Their only business is to chant and remember the holy name,
fame and pastimes of the Lord and, according to personal capacity, to
distribute the message for others’ welfare without motive of material gain.

And so, 0 Brahmana Vyasadeva, in due course of time I, who was

ments, being completely freed from all material taints, met with death, as

lightning and illumination occur simultaneously.

PURPORT

To be fully absorbed in the thought of Krsna means clearance of
material dirts or hankerings. As a very rich man has no hankerings for
small petty things, so also a devotee of Lord Krsna, who is guaranteed to
pass on to the kingdom of God where life is eternal, fully cognizant and


--- Page 314 ---
304 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 6
blissful, has naturally no hankerings for petty material things, which are
like dolls or shadows of the reality and are without permanent value. That
is the sign of spiritually enriched persons. And in due course of time, when
a pure devotee is completely prepared, all of a sudden the change of body
occurs which is commonly called death. And for the pure devotee such a
change takes place exactly like lightning, and illumination follows simul-
taneously. That is to say a devotee simultaneously .changes his material
body and develops a spiritual body by the will of the Supreme. Even
before death, a pure devotee has no material affection due to his body
being spiritualized like a red-hot iron in contact with fire.

Having been awarded a transcendental body befitting an associate of

PURPORT

Informed by the Personality of Godhead that he would be awarded a
transcendental body befitting the Lord’s association, Narada got his
spiritual body as soon as he quitted his material body. This transcendental
body is free from material affinity and invested with three primary tran-
scendental qualities, namely eternity, freedom from material modes, and


--- Page 315 ---
Text 29] Conversation Between Narada and Vyasa 305
freedom from reactions of fruitive activities. The material body is always
afflicted with these three inebrieties. A devotees body becomes at once
surcharged with the transcendental qualities as soon as he is engaged in the
devotional service of the Lord. It acts like the magnetic influence of a
touchstone upon iron. The influence of transcendental devotional service
is like that. Therefore change of the body means stoppage of the reaction
of three qualitative modes of material nature upon the pure devotee. There
are many instances of this in the revealed scriptures. Dhruva Maharaja and
Prahlada Maharaja and many other devotees were able to see the Person-
ality of Godhead face to face apparently in the same body. This means
that the quality of a devotee’s body changes from material to transcen-
dence. That is the opinion of the authorized Gosvamis via the authentic
scriptures. In the Brahma-sarnhita it is said that beginning from the indra-
gopa germ up to the great Indra, King of heaven, all living beings are
subjected to the law of karma and are bound to suffer and enjoy the
fruitive results of their own work. But only the devotee is exempt from
such reaction by the causeless mercy of the supreme authority, the
Personality of Godhead.

Narada is known as the son of Brahma, as Lord Krsna is known as the
son of Vasudeva. The Personality of Godhead and His liberated devotees
like Narada appear in the material world by the same process. As it is said
in the Bhagavad-gita, the birth and activities of the Lord are all transcen-
dental. Therefore, according to authorized opinion, the birth of Narada as
the son of Brahma is also a transcendental pastime. His appearance and
dissappearance are practically on the same level as that of the Lord. The
Lord and His devotees are therefore simultaneously one and different as
spiritual entities. They belong to the same category of transcendence.

The duration of aday in thelife of Brahma is 4,320,000,000 solar years.
This is stated also in the Bhagauvad-gita. So for this period Brahmaji rests in
yoga-nidrd within the body of the Garbhodakasayi Visnu, the generator of
Brahma. Thus after the sleeping period of Brahmi, when there is again
creation by the will of the Lord through the agency of Brahma, all the

great ysis again appear from different parts of the transcendental body, and
Narada also appears. This means that Narada appears in the same transcen-
dental body, just as a man awakes from sleep in the same body. Sri Narada
is eternally free to move in all parts of the transcendental and material
creations of the Almighty. He appears and disappears in his own transcen-
dental body which is without distinction of body and soul, unlike condi-
tioned beings.

TRANSLATION
Since then, by the grace of the almighty Visnu, I travel everywhere
without restriction both in the transcendental world and in the three
divisions of the material world. This is because I am fixed in unbroken
devotional service of the Lord.
PURPORT
As stated in the Bhagavad-gitd, there are three divisions of the material
spheres, namely the @rdhaloka (topmost planets), madhyaloka (midway
planets) and adhaloka (downward planets). And beyond the @rdhaloka
planets, that is to say above the Brahmaloka, there are the material
coverings of the universes, and above that there is the spiritual sky which
is unlimited in expansion, containing unlimited self-illuminated Vaikuntha
planets inhabited by God Himself along with Hic associates who are all

eternally liberated living entities. Sr Narada Muni could enter all these
planets both in the material and spiritual spheres without restriction, as
much as the almighty Lord is free to move personally in any part of His
creation. In the material world the living beings are influenced by the
three material modes of nature, namely goodness, passion and ignorance.
But Sri Narada Muni is transcendental to all these material modes, and thus
he can travel everywhere unrestricted. He is a liberated spaceman. The cause-
less mercy of Lord Visnu is unparalleled, and such mercy is perceived by
the devotees only by the grace of the Lord. Therefore, the devotees never
fall down, but the materialists, i.e., the fruitive workers and the speculative
philosophers, do fall down, being forced by the respective modes of
nature. The rsis, as above mentioned, cannot enter into the transcendental
world like Narada. This fact is disclosed in the Narasimha Purana. Rsis like
Marici areauthorities in fruitive work, and rsis like Sanaka and Sanitana are
authorities in philosophical speculations. But Sri Narada Muni is the
prime authority for transcendental devotional service of the Lord. All the
great authorities in the devotional service of the Lord follow in the
footsteps of Narada Muni in the order of the Narada-bhakti-sitra, and
therefore all the devotees of the Lord are unhesitatingly qualified to enter
into the kingdom of God, Vaikuntha.

charged with transcendental sound and which was given to me by Lord
Krsna.
PURPORT

The musical string instrument called the vipd, which was handed to
Narada by Lord Sti Krsna, is described in the Liga Purina, and this is
confirmed by Srila Jiva Gosvami. This transcendental instrument is identical
with Lord Sri Krsna and Narada because all of them are of the same
transcendental category. Sound vibrated by the instrument cannot be
material, and therefore the glories and pastimes which are broadcast by
the instrument of Narada are also transcendental, without a tinge of
material inebriety. The seven singing meters, namely Sa (Sarja), R
(Rsabha), Ga (Gandhara), Ma (Madhyam), Pa (Pancham), Dha (Dhaivata)
and Ni (Nisada) are also transcendental and specifically meant for transcen-
dental songs. As a pure devotee of the Lord, Sri Narada Deva is always
fulfilling his obligation to the Lord for His gift of the instrument, and thus
he is always engaged in singing His transcendental glories and is therefore
infallible in his exalted position. Following in the footsteps of Srila
Narada Muni, a self-realized soul in the material world should also properly
use the sound meters, namely Sa, R, Ga, Ma, etc., in the service of the
Lord by constantly singing the glories of the Lord, as confirmed in the
Bhagavad-gita.

TRANSLATION
The Supreme Lord Sri Krsna, whose glories and activities are pleasing
to hear, at once appears on the seat of my heart, as if called for, as soon as
1 begin to chant His holy activities.
PURPORT
The Absolute Personality of Godhead is not different from His transcen-
dental name, form, pastimes and the sound vibrations thereof. As soon as
a pure devotee engages himself in the pure devotional service of hearing,
chanting and remembering the name, fame and activities of the Lord, at
once He becomes visible to the transcendental eyes of the pure devotee by
reflecting Himself on the mirror of the heart by spiritual television. There-
fore a pure devotee who is related with the Lord in loving transcendental
service can experience the presence of the Lord at every moment. It is a
natural psychology in every individual case that a person likes to hear and
enjoy his personal glories enumerated by others. That is a natural instinct,
and the Lord, being also an individual personality like others, is not an
exception to this psychology because psychological characteristics visible
in the individual souls are but reflections of the same psychology in the
Absolute Lord. The only difference is that the Lord is the greatest
Personality of all and absolute in all His affairs. If, therefore, the Lord is
attracted by the pure devotee’s chanting of His glories, there is nothing
astonishing. Since He is absolute, He can appear Himself in the picture of
His glorification, the two things being identical. Srila Narada chants the
glorification of the Lord not for his personal benefit but because the
glorifications are identical with the Lord. Narada Muni forces the presence
of the Lord by the transcendental chanting.

TRANSLATION
It is personally experienced by me that those who are always full of
cares and anxieties due to desiring contact of the senses with their
objects can cross the ocean of nescience on a most suitable boat—the
constant chanting of the transcendental activities of the Personality of
Godhead.
PURPORT
The symptom of a living being is that he cannot remain silent even for
some time. He must be doing something, thinking of something or talking
about something. Generally the materialistic men think and discuss about
subjects which satisfy their senses. But as these things are exercized under
the influence of the external illusory energy, such sensual activities do not
actually give them any satisfaction. On the contrary, they become full with
cares and anxieties. This is called mayd, or what is not. That which cannot
give them satisfaction is accepted as an object for satisfaction. So Narada
Muni, by his personal experience, says that satisfaction for such frustrated
beings engaged in sense gratification is to chant always the activities of the
Lord. The point is that the subject matter only should be changed. No one
can check the thinking activities of a living being, nor the feeling, willing
or working processes. But if one wants actual happiness, one must change
the subject matter only. Instead of talking of the politics of a dying man,
one might discuss the politics administered by the Lord Himself. Instead
of relishingactivities of the cinema artists, one can turn his attention to the
activities of the Lord with His eternal associates like the gopis and Lakgmis.
The almighty Personality of Godhead, by His causeless mercy, descends
on the earth and manifests activities almost on the line of the worldly
men, but at the same time extraordinarily, because He is almighty. He
does so for the benefit of all conditioned souls so that they can turn
their attention to transcendence. By doing so, the conditioned soul will
gradually be promoted to the transcendental position and easily cross the
ocean of nescience, the source of all miseries. This is stated from personal
experience by an authority like Sri Narada Muni. And we can have the


--- Page 322 ---
312 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 6
same experience also if we begin to follow in the footsteps of the great
sage, the dearmost devotee of the Lord.

TRANSLATION
It is true that by practicing restraint of the senses by the yoga system
one can get relief from the disturbances of desire and lust, but this is not
sufficient to give satisfaction to the soul, for this [satisfaction] is derived
from devotional service to the Personality of Godhead.
PURPORT
Yoga aims at controlling the senses. By practice of the mystic process
of bodily exercize in sitting, thinking, feeling, willing, concentrating,
meditating and at last being merged into transcendence, one can control
the senses. The senses are considered like venomous serpents, and the yoga
system is just to control them. On the other hand, Narada Muni recommends
another method for controlling the senses in the transcendental loving
service of Mukunda the Personality of Godhead. By his experience he says
that devotional service of the Lord is more effective and practical than
the system of artificially controlling the senses. In the service of the Lord
Mukunda, the senses are transcendentally engaged. Thus there is no chance
of their being engaged in sense satisfaction. The senses want some engage-


--- Page 323 ---
Text 36] Conversation Between Narada and Vyasa 313
ment. To check them artificially is no check at all because as soon as there
is some opportunity for enjoyment, the serpent-like senses will certainly
take advantage of it. There are many such instances in history, just like
Visvamitra Muni, who fell a victim of the beauty of Menaka. But Thakur
Haridasa was allured at midnight by the well dressed maya, and still she
could not induce that great devotee in her trap.

The whole idea is that without devotional service of the Lord, neither
the yoga system nor dry philosophical speculation can ever become
successful. Pure devotional service of the Lord, without being tinged with
fruitive work, mystic yoga or speculative philosophy, is the foremost
procedure to attain self-realization. Such pure devotional service is transcen-
dental in nature, and the systems of yoga and jiidna are subordinate to
such a process. When the transcendental devotional service is mixed with
the other subordinate process, it is no longer transcendental but is called
mixed devotional service. Srila Vyasadeva, the author of Srimad-Bhagava-
tam, will gradually develop all these different systems of transcendental
realization in the text.

314 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 6

PURPORT
The process of devotional activities from the beginning to the stage of
transcendence is all duly explained to satisfy the enquiries of Vyasadeva.
He has explained how the seeds of devotional service were sown by
transcendental association and how they gradually developed by hearing
the sages. The result of such hearing is detachment from worldliness, so
much so that even a small boy could receive the death news of his mother,
who was his only caretaker, as the blessing of God. And at once he took
the opportunity to search out the Lord. A sincere urge for having an
interview with the Lord was also granted to him, although it is not possible
for anyone to see the Lord with mundane eyes. He also explained how by
execution of pure transcendental service one can get rid of fruitive action
of accumulated work and how he transformed his material body into a
spiritual one. The spiritual body is alone able to enter into the spiritual
realm of the Lord, and no one but a pure devotee is eligible to enter into
the kingdom of God. All the mysteries of transcendental realization are
duly experienced by Narada Muni himself, and therefore by hearing such
an authority one can have some idea of theresults of devotional life, which
are hardly delineated even in the original texts of the Vedas. In the Vedas
and Upanisads there are only indirect hints to all this. Nothing is directly
explained there, and therefore Srimad-Bhagavatam is the mature fruit of

all the Vedic trees of literatures.

Sita Gosvami said: Thus addressing V yasadeva, Srila Narada Muni took

free will.

PURPORT

Every living being is anxious for full freedom because that is his tran-
scendental nature. And this freedom is obtained only through the tran-
scendental service of the Lord. Illusioned by the external energy,
everyone thinks that he is free, but actually he is bound up by the laws of
nature. A conditioned soul cannot freely move from one place to another
even on this earth, and what to speak of one planet to another. But a full-
fledged free soul like Narada, always engaged in chanting the Lord’s glory,
is free to move not only on earth but also in any part of the universe, as
well as in any part of the spiritual sky. We can just imagine the extent and
unlimitedness of his freedom, which is as good as that of the Supreme
Lord. There is no reason or obligation for his travelling, and no one can
stop him from his free movement. Similarly, the transcendental system of
devotional service is also free. It may or may not develop in a particular
person even after undergoing all the detailed formulas. Similarly, the
association of the devotee is also free. One may be fortunate to have it, or
one may not have it even after thousands of endeavors. Therefore, in all
spheres of devotional service, freedom is the main pivot. Without freedom
there is no execution of devotional service. The freedom surrendered to the
Lord does not mean that the devotee becomes dependent in every respect.
To surrender unto the Lord through the transparent medium of the
spiritual master is to attain complete freedom of life.

All glory and success to Srila Narada Muni because he glorifies the

pleasure and also enlivens all the distressed souls of the universe.
PURPORT

Sri Narada Muni plays on his instrument to glorify the transcendental
activities of the Lord and to give relief to all miserable living entities of the
universe. No one is happy here within the universe, and what is felt as
happiness is maya’s illusion. The illusory energy of the Lord is so strong
that even the hog who lives on filthy stool feels happy. No one can be
truly happy within the material world. Srila Narada Muni, in order to
enlighten the miserable inhabitants, wanders everywhere. His mission is to
get them back home, back to Godhead. That is the mission of all genuine
devotees of the Lord following the footsteps of that great sage.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the First Canto, Sixth Chapter,
of Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “Conversation Between Narada and
Vyasa.”

PURPORT
For spiritual advancement of knowledge a suitable place and atmosphere
are definitely required. The place on the western bank of the Sarasvatl is
especially suitable for this purpose. And there is the @srama of Vyasadeva
at Samyaprasa. Srila Vyasadeva was a householder, yet his residential
place is called an d§rama. An @srama is a place where spiritual culture is
always foremost. It does not matter whether the place belongs to a house-
holder or a mendicant. The whole varnasrama system is so designed that
each and every status of life is called an @srama. This means that spiritual


--- Page 329 ---

culture is the common factor for all. The brahmacaris, the grhasthas, the
vanaprasthas and the sannydasis all belong to the same mission of life,
namely, realization of the Supreme. Therefore none of them are less
important as far as spiritual culture is concerned. The difference is a matter
of formality on the strength of renunciation. The sannydsis are held in
high estimation on the strength of practical renunciation.

TRANSLATION
Thus he fixed his mind, perfectly engaging it by linking it in devotional
service [bhakti-yoga] without any tinge of materialism, and thus he saw
the Absolute Personality of Godhead along with His external energy, which
was under full control.
PURPORT

Perfect vision of the Absolute Truth is possible only by the linking
process of devotional service. This is also confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita.
One can perfectly realize the Absolute Truth Personality of Godhead only
by the process of devotional service, and one can enter into the kingdom
of God by such perfect knowledge. Imperfect realization of the Absolute
by the partial approach of the impersonal Brahman or localized Paramatma
does not permit anyone to enter into the kingdom of God. Sri Narada
advised Srila Vyisadeva to become absorbed in transcendental meditation
on the Personality of Godhead and His activities. Srila Vyasadeva did not
take notice of the effulgence of Brahman because that is not absolute
vision. The absolute vision is the Personality of Godhead, as it is confirmed
in the Bhagavad-gita: Vasudevah sarvam iti. In the Upanisads also it is
confirmed that Vasudeva, the Personality of Godhead, is covered by the
golden glowing hiranmayena patrena veil of impersonal Brahman, and when
that curtain is removed by the mercy of the Lord the real face of the
Absolute is seen. The Absolute is mentioned here as the purusa or person.
The Absolute Personality of Godhead is mentioned in so many Vedic
literatures, and in the Bhagavad-gita, the purusa is confirmed as the
eternal and original person. The Absolute Personality of Godhead is the
perfect person. The Supreme Person has manifold energies, out of which
the internal, external and marginal energies are specifically important. The
energy mentioned here is the external energy, as will be clear from the


--- Page 331 ---
Text 5] The Son of Drona Punished 321
statements of her activities. The internal energy is there along with the
Absolute Person as the moonlight is there with the moon. The external
energy is compared with darkness because it keeps the living entities in the
darkness of ignorance. The word apdsrayam suggests that this energy of
the Lord is under full control. The internal potency or superior energy
is also called mdyd, but it is spiritual mayd, or energy exhibited in the
absolute realm. When one is under the shelter of this internal potency, the
darkness of material ignorance is at once dissipated. And even those who
are atmdrama, or fixed in trance, take shelter of this mdya or internal
energy. Devotional service, or bhakti-yoga, is the function of the internal
energy; thus there is no place for the inferior energy or material energy,
just as there is no place for darkness in the effulgence of spiritual
light. Such internal energy is even superior to the spiritual bliss attainable
in the conception of impersonal Brahman. It is stated in the Bhagavad-gita
that the impersonal Brahman effulgence is also an emanation from the
Absolute Personality of Godhead Sri Krsna. The Parama-Purusa cannot be
anyone except Sri Krsna Himself, as it will be explained in the later slokas.

--- Page 332 ---
322 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 7
PURPORT

The root cause of suffering by the materialistic living beings is pointed
out with remedial measures which are to be undertaken and also the ulti-
mate perfection to be gained. All this is mentioned in this particular verse.
The living being is by constitution transcendental to material encagement,
but he is now imprisoned by the external energy, and therefore he thinks
himself one of the material products. And due to this unholy contact,
the pure spiritual entity suffers material miseries under the modes of
material nature. The living entity misunderstands himself to be a material
product. This means that the present perverted way of thinking, feeling
and willing, under material conditions, is not natural for him. But he has
his normal way of thinking, feeling and willing. The living being in his
original state is not without thinking, willing and feeling power. It is also
confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita that the actual knowledge of the condi-
tioned soul is now covered by nescience. Thus the theory that a living
being is absolute impersonal Brahman is refuted herein. This cannot be,
because the living entity has his own way of thinking in his original uncon-
ditional state also. The present conditional state is due to the influence of
the external energy, which means that the illusory energy takes the initia-
tive while the Supreme Lord is aloof. The Lord does not desire that a living
being be illusioned by external energy. The external energy is aware of this
fact, but still she accepts a thankless task of keeping the forgotten soul
under illusion by her bewildering influence. The Lord does not interfere
with the task of the illusory energy because such performances of the
illusory energy are also necessary for reformation of the conditioned soul.
An affectionate father does not like his children to be chastised by another
agent, yet he puts his disobedient children under the custody of a severe
man just to bring them to order. But the all-affectionate Almighty Father
desires at the same time relief for the conditioned soul, relief from the
clutches of the illusory energy. The king puts the disobedient citizens
within the walls of the jail, but sometimes the king, desiring the prisoners’
relief, personally goes there and pleads for reformation, and on doing so
the prisoners are set free. Similarly, the Supreme Lord descends from His
kingdom upon the kingdom of illusory energy and personally gives relief
in the form of the Bhagavad-gita, wherein He personally suggests that the
ways of illusory energy are very stiff to overcome, but one who surrenders
unto the lotus feet of the Lord is set free by the order of the Supreme.
This surrendering process is the remedial measure for getting relief from
the bewildering ways of the illusory energy. The surrendering process is


--- Page 333 ---
Text 5] The Son of Drona Punished 323
completed by the influence of association. The Lord has suggested, there-
fore, that by the influence of the speeches of saintly persons who have
actually realized the Supreme, men are engaged in His transcendental
loving service. The conditioned soul gets a taste for hearing about the
Lord, and by such hearing only he is gradually elevated to the platform of
respect, devotion and attachment for the Lord. The whole thing is com-
pleted by the surrendering process. Herein also the same suggestion is
made by the Lord in His incarnation of Vyasadeva. This means that the
conditioned souls are being reclaimed by the Lord both ways, namely by
the process of punishment by the external energy of the Lord, and by
Himself as the spiritual master within and without. Within the heart of
every living being the Lord Himself as the Supersoul Paramatma becomes
the spiritual master, and from without He becomes the spiritual master in
the shape of scriptures, saints and initiator spiritual master. This is still
more explicitly explained in the next sloka.

Personal superintendence of the illusory energy is confirmed in the
Vedas (the Kena Upanisad) in relation to the demigods’ controlling power.
Herein also it is clearly stated that the living entity is controlled by the
external energy in a personal capacity. The living being thus subject to the
control of external energy is differently situated. It is clear, however, from
the present statement of Bhdgavatam that the same external energy is
situated in the inferior position before the Personality of Godhead or the
perfect being. The perfect being, or the Lord, cannot be approached even
by the illusory energy, who can only work on the living entities. Therefore
it is sheer imagination that the Supreme Lord is illusioned by the illusory
energy and thus becomes a living being. If the living being and the Lord
would have been in the same category, then it would have been quite
possible for Vyasadeva to see it, and there would have been no question of
material distress on the part of the illusioned being because the Supreme
Being is fully cognizant. So there are so many unscrupulous imaginations
on the part of the monists to endeavor to put both the Lord and the living
being in the same category. Had it been so, then Srila Sukadeva Gosvami
would not have taken the trouble to describe the transcendental pastimes
of the Lord, if they were all manifestations of illusory energy.

Srimad-Bhagavatam is the summum bonum remedy for the suffering
humanity in the clutches of mdyd. Srila Vyasadeva therefore first of all
diagnosed the actual disease of the conditioned souls, i.e. their being
illusioned by the external energy. He also saw the perfect Supreme Being
from whom illusory energy is far removed, though He saw both the
diseased conditioned souls and also the cause of the disease. And the


--- Page 334 ---
324 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 7
remedial measures are suggested in the next verse. Both the Supreme
Personality of Godhead and the living beings are undoubtedly qualitatively
one, but the Lord is the controller of the illusory energy, whereas the
living entity is controlled by the illusory energy. Thus the Lord and the
living beings are simultaneously one and different. Another point is distinct
herein: that eternal relation between the Lord and the living being is
transcendental, otherwise the Lord would not have taken the trouble to
reclaim the conditioned souls from the clutches of maya. In the same way
the living entity is also required to revive his natural love and affection for
the Lord, and that is the highest perfection of the living entity. Srimad-
Bhagavatam treats the conditioned soul with an aim to that goal of life.

The material miseries of the living entity, which are superfluous to him,

compiled this Vedic literature, which is in relation to the Supreme Truth.
PURPORT
Srila Vyasadeva was the all-perfect Personality of Godhead. The state-
ment suggests that the complete unit of the Personality of Godhead in-


--- Page 335 ---
Text 7] The Son of Drona Punished 325
cludes His parts and parcels also. He saw, therefore, His different energies,
namely the internal energy, the marginal energy and the external energy.
He saw also His different plenary portions and parts of the plenary por-
tions, namely His different incarnations also, and he specifically observed
the unwanted miseries of the conditioned souls who are bewildered by the
external energy. And at last he saw the remedial measure for the condi-
tioned souls, namely, the process of devotional service. It is a great
transcendental science and begins with the process of hearing and chanting
the name, fame, glory, etc., of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Re-
vival of the dormant affection or love of Godhead does not depend on the
mechanical system of hearing and chanting, but it solely and wholly
depends on the causeless mercy of the Lord. When the Lord is fully
satisfied with the sincere efforts of the devotee, He may endow him with
His loving transcendental service. But even with the prescribed forms of
hearing and chanting, there is at once mitigation of the superfluous and
unwanted miseries of material existence. Such mitigation of material affec-
tion does not wait for development of transcendental knowledge. Rather,
knowledge is dependent on devotional service for ultimate realization of
the Supreme Truth.

326 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 7
PURPORT

There are various senses, of which the ear is the most effective. This
sense works even when a man is deep asleep. One can protect himself from
the hands of an enemy while awake, but while asleep one is protected by
the ear only. The importance of hearing is mentioned here in connection
with attaining the highest perfection of life, namely, getting free from three
material pangs. Everyone is full of lamentation at every moment; he is
after the mirage of illusory things and is always afraid of his supposed
enemy. These are the primary symptoms of material disease. And it is
definitely suggested herein that simply by hearing the message of Srimad-
Bhagavatam one gets attachment for the Supreme Personality of Godhead
ऽप Krsna, and as soon as this is effected the symptoms of the material
diseases disappear. Srila Vyasadeva was the all-perfect Personality of God-
head, and in this statement the all-perfect Personality of Godhead Sri
Krsna is clearly confirmed.

The ultimate result of devotional service is to develop genuine love for
the Supreme Personality. Love is a word which is often used in relation
with man and woman. And love is the only word that can be properly
used to indicate the relation between Lord Krsna and the living entities.
The living entities are mentioned as prakrti in the Bhagavad-gitd, and in
Sanskrit prakrti is a feminine object. The Lord is always described as the
Parama-Purusa or the supreme male personality. Thus the affection be-
tween the Lord and the living entities is something like that between the
male and the female. Therefore the term love of Godhead is quite appro-
priate.

Loving devotional service of the Lord begins with hearing about the
Lord. There is no difference between the Lord and the subject matter
heard about Him. The Lord is absolute in all respects, and thus there is
no difference between Him and the subject matter heard about Him.
Therefore, hearing about Him means immediate contact with Him by the
process of vibration of the transcendental sound. And the transcendental
sound is so effective that it acts at once by removing all material affections
mentioned above. As mentioned before, a living entity develops a sort of
complexity by material association, and the illusory encagement of the
material body is accepted as an actual fact. Under such false complexity,
the living beings under different categories of life become illusioned in
different ways. Even in the most developed stage of human life, the same
illusion prevails in the form of many isms and divides the loving relation
with the Lord and thereby divides the loving relation between man and


--- Page 337 ---
Text 8] The Son of Drona Punished 327
man. By hearing the subject matter of Srimad-Bhagavatam this false
complexity of materialism is removed, and real peace in society begins,
which politicians aspire for so eagerly in so many political situations. The
politicians want a peaceful situation between man and man, and nation
and nation, but at the same time, because of too much attachment for
material domination, there is illusion and fearfulness. Therefore the
politicians’ peace conferences cannot bring about peace in society. It can
only be done by hearing the subject matter described in the Srimad-
Bhagavatam about the Supreme Personality of Godhead Sri Krsna. The
foolish politicians may go on holding peace and summit conferences for
hundreds of years, but they will fail to achieve success. Until we reach the
stage of reestablishing our lost relation with Krsna, the illusion of accept-
ing the body as the self will prevail, and thus fearfulness will also prevail.
As for validity of ङतं Krsna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there
are hundreds and thousands of evidences fromrevealed scriptures, and there
are hundreds and thousands of evidences from personal experiences of
devotees in various places like Vrndavana, Navadvipa and Puri. Even in
the Kaumadi Dictionary the synonyms of Krsna are given as the son of
Yasoda and the Supreme Personality of Godhead Parambrahman. The
conclusion is that simply by hearing the Vedic literature Srimad-
Bhagavatam, one can have direct connection with the Supreme Personality
of Godhead इपर Krsna, and thereby one can attain the highest perfection of
life by transcending worldly miseries, illusion and fearfulness. These are
practical tests for one who has actually given a submissive hearing to the
readings of the Srimad-Bhagavatam.

TRANSLATION
The great sage Vyasadeva, after compiling the Srimad-Bhagavatam and
revising it, taught it to his own son, Sri Sukadeva Gosvami, who was already
engaged in self-realization.
PURPORT
Srimad-Bhagavatam is the natural commentation on the Brahma-siitras
compiled by the same author. This Brahma-sittra or Vedanta-siitra is meant
for those who are already engaged in self-realization. Srimad-Bhdgavatam
is so made that one becomes at once engaged in the path of self-realization
simply by hearing the topics. Although it is especially meant for the
paramahainsas, or those who are totally engaged in self-realization, it works
into the depth of the heart of those who may be worldly men. Worldly
men are all engaged in sense gratification. But even such men will find
in this Vedic literature a remedial measure for their material diseases.
Sukadeva Gosvami was a liberated soul from the very beginning of his
birth, and his father taught him Srimad-Bhagavatam. Amongst mundane
scholars, there is some diversity of opinion as to the date of compilation
of Srimad-Bhagavatam. It is, however, certain from the text of the
Bhagavatam that it was compiled before the disappearance of King Pariksit
and after the departure of Lord Krsna. When Maharaja Pariksit was ruling
the world as the King of Bharatavarsa, he chastised the personality of Kali.
According to revealed scriptures and astrological calculation, the age of
Kali is in its 5,000th year. Therefore, Srimad-Bhagavatam was compiled
not less than five thousand years ago. Mahabharata was compiled before
Srimad-Bhdgavatam, and the Puranas were compiled before Mahabharata.
That is an estimation of the date of compilation of the different Vedic
literatures. The synopsis of Srimad-Bhagavatam was given before the
detailed description under instruction of Narada. Srimad-Bhdgavatam is
the science for following the path of nivrtti-marga. The path of pravrtti-
marga was condemned by Narada. That is the natural inclination for all
conditioned souls. The theme of Srimad-Bhagavatam is the cure of the
materialistic disease of the human being, or stopping completely the pangs
of material existence.

Sri Saunaka asked Sita Gosvami: Sri Sukadeva Gosvami was already
on the path of self-realization, and thus he was pleased with his own self.
So why did he take the trouble to undergo the study of such a vast
literature?
PURPORT
For the people in general the highest perfection of life is to cease from
material activities and be fixed on the path of self-realization. Those who
take pleasure in sense enjoyment, or those who are fixed in material
bodily welfare work, are called karmis. Out of thousands and millions of
such karmis, one may become an atmarima by self-realization. Atma
means self, and rama means to take pleasure. Everyone is searching after
the highest pleasure, but the standard of pleasure of one may be different
from the standard of another. Therefore, the standard of pleasure enjoyed
by the karmis is different from that of the atmaramas. The atmaramas are
completely indifferent to material enjoyment in every respect. Srila Suka-
deva Gosvami had already attained that stage, and still he was attracted to
undergo the trouble of studying the great Bhagavatam literature. This
means that S$rimad-Bhagavatam is postgraduate study even for the atma-
ramas, who have surpassed all the studies of Vedic knowledge.

TRANSLATION

All different varieties of atmaramas [those who take pleasure in itma,
or spirit self], especially those established on the path of self-realization,
though freed from all kinds of material bondage, desire to render un-
alloyed devotional service unto the Personality of Godhead. This means
that the Lord possesses transcendental qualities and therefore can attract
everyone, including liberated souls.

PURPORT

Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu explained this atmdrama loka very
vividly before His chief devotee Srila Sanitana Gosvami. He points out
eleven factors in the $loka, namely 1) atmarama, 2) munayah, 3) nir-
grantha, 4) api, 5) ca, 6) urukrama, 7) kurvanti, 8) ahaitukim, 9) bhaktim,
10) ittham-bhiita-gunah, and 11) harih. According to the Visva-Prakdsa
Sanskrit Dictionary, there are seven synonyms for the word atmarama,
which are as follows: 1) Brahman (the Absolute Truth), 2) body, 3) mind,
4) endeavor, 5) endurance, 6) intelligence, and 7) personal habits.

The word munayah refers to 1) those who are thoughtful, 2) those who
are grave or silent, 3) ascetics, 4) the persistent, 5) mendicants, 6) sages,
and 7) saints.

The word nirgrantha conveys these ideas: 1) one who is liberated from
nescience, 2) one who has no connection with scriptural injunction, i.e.,
who is freed from the obligation of the rules and regulations mentioned in
the revealed scriptures like ethics, Vedas, philosophy, psychology, meta-
physics, etc., (in other words the fools, illiterate, urchins, etc., who have
no connection with regulative principles), 3) a capitalist, and also 4) one
who is penniless.


--- Page 341 ---
Text 10] The Son of Drona Punished 331

According to the Sabda-kosa Dictionary, the affix ni is used in the sense
of 1) certainty, 2) counting, 3) building, and 4) forbiddance, and the word
grantha is used in the sense of wealth, thesis, vocabulary, etc.

The word urukrama means the one whose activities are glorious. Krama
means step. This word urukrama specifically indicates the Lord’s incarna-
tion as Vamana, who covered the whole universe by immeasurable steps.
Lord Visnu is powerful, and His activities are so glorious that He has
created the spiritual world by His internal potency and the material world
by His external potency. By His all-pervading features He is everywhere
present as the Supreme Truth, and in His personal feature He is always
present in His transcendental abode of Goloka Vrndavana where He
displays His transcendental pastimes in all variegatedness. His activities
cannot be compared with anyone else’s, and therefore the word urukrama
is just applicable to Him only.

According to Sanskrit verbal arrangement, kurvanti means to do things
for someone else. Therefore, it means that the ৫1107৫71105 render devo-
tional service unto the Lord not for personal interest but for the pleasure
of the Lord, Urukrama.

Hetu means causal. There are many causes for one’s sense satisfaction,
and they can be chiefly classified as material enjoyment, mystic powers
and liberation, which are generally desired by progressive persons. As far
as material enjoyments are concerned, they are innumerable, and the
materialists are eager to increase them more and more because they are
under the illusory energy. There is no end to the list of material enjoy-
ments, nor can anyone in the material universe have all of them. As far as
the mystic powers are concerned, they are eight in all (such as to become
the minutist in form, to become weightless, to have anything one desires,
to lord it over the material nature, to control other living beings, to throw
earthly globes in outer space, etc.). These mystic powers are mentioned in
the Bhagavatam (11.15). The forms of liberation are five in number.

Therefore, unalloyed devotion means service to the Lord without desire
for the above-mentioned personal benefits. And the powerful Personality
of Godhead Sri Krsna can be fully satisfied by such unalloyed devotees
free from all sorts of desires for personal benefit.

Unalloyed devotional service of the Lord progresses in different stages.
Practice of devotional service in the material field is of eighty-one different
qualities, and above such activities there is the transcendental practice of
devotional service, which is one and is called sadhana-bhakti. When
unalloyed practice of s@dhana-bhakti is matured into transcendental love
for the Lord, the transcendental loving service of the Lord begins gradually


--- Page 342 ---
332 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 7
developing into nine progressive stages of loving service under the headings
of attachment, love, affection, feelings, affinity, adherence, following,
ecstasy and intense feelings of separation.

The attachment of an inactive devotee develops up to the stage of
transcendental love of God. Attachment of an active servitor develops up
to the stage of adherence, and that for a friendly devotee develops up to
the stage of following, and the same is also the case for the paternal
devotees. Devotees in conjugal love develop. ecstasy up to the stage of
intense feelings of separation. These are some of the features of unalloyed
devotional service of the Lord.

According to Hari-bhakti-sudhodaya, the import of the word ittham-
bhiita is complete bliss. Transcendental bliss in the realization of imper-
sonal Brahman becomes comparable with the scanty water contained in
the pit made by a cow’s hoof. It is nothing compared to the ocean of
bliss of the vision of the Personality of Godhead. The personal form of
Lord Sri Krsna is so attractive that it comprehends all attraction, all bliss
and all tastes (rasas). These attractions are so strong that no one wants to
exchange material enjoyment, mystic powers and liberation for them.
There is no need of logical arguments in support of this statement, but
out of one’s own nature one becomes attracted by the qualities of Lord
Sri Krsna. We must know for certain that the qualities of the Lord have
nothing to do with mundane qualities. All of them are full of bliss, know-
ledge and eternity. There are innumerable qualities of the Lord, and one is
attracted by one quality while another is attracted by another.

Great sages, such as the four bachelor devotees Sanaka, Sanatana,
Sananda and Sanat-kumara, are attracted by the fragrance of flowers and
tulasi leaves anointed with the pulp of sandalwood offered at the lotus
feet of the Lord. Similarly, Sukadeva Gosvimi was attracted by the
transcendental pastimes of the Lord. Sukadeva Gosvimi was already
situated in the liberated stage, yet he was attracted by the pastimes of the
Lord. This proves that the quality of His pastimes has nothing to do with
material affinity. Similarly, the young cowherd damsels were attracted by
the bodily feature of the Lord, and Rukmini was attracted by hearing
about the glories of the Lord. Lord Krsna attracts even the mind of the
goddess of fortune. He attracts, in special cases, the minds of all young
girls. He attracts the minds of the elderly ladies by paternal affection. He
attracts the minds of the male in the humors of servitude and friendship.

The word hari conveys various meanings, but the chief import of the
word is that He (the Lord) vanquishes everything inauspicious and takes
away the mind of the devotee by awarding pure transcendental love. By


--- Page 343 ---
Text 11] The Son of Drona Punished 333
remembering the Lord in acute distress one can be free from all varieties
of miseries and anxieties. Gradually the Lord vanquishes all obstacles on
the path of devotional service of a pure devotee, and the result of nine
devotional activities, such as hearing, chanting, etc., becomes manifested.

By His personal features and transcendental attributes, the Lord attracts
all psychological activities of a pure devotee. Such is the attractive power
of Lord Krsna. The attraction is so powerful that a pure devotee never
hankers for any one of the four principles of religion. These are the
attractive features of the transcendental attributes of the Lord. And
adding to this the words api and ca, one can increase the imports
unlimitedly. According to Sanskrit grammar there are seven synonyms for
the word api.

So by interpreting each and every word of this sloka, one can see
unlimited numbers of transcendental qualities of Lord Krsna that attract
the mind of a pure devotee.

Srila Sukadeva Gosvami, son of Srila Vyasadeva, was not only transcen-

Thus he underwent the study of this great narration [ Srimad-Bhagavatam].


--- Page 344 ---
334 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 7
PURPORT

According to Brehma-vaivarta Purina, Srila Sukadeva Gosvami was a
liberated soul even within the womb of his mother. Srila Vyasadeva knew
that the child, after his birth, would not stay at home. Therefore he
(Vyasadeva) impressed upon him the synopsis of the Bhagavatam so that
the child could be made attached to the transcendental activities of the
Lord. After his birth, the child was still more educated in the subject of
the Bhagavatam by recitation of the actual poems.

The idea is that generally the liberated souls are attached to the feature
of impersonal Brahman with a monistic view of becoming one with the
supreme whole. But by the association of pure devotees like Vyasadeva,
even the liberated soul becomes attracted to the transcendental qualities
of the Lord. By the mercy of Sti Narada, Srila Vyasadeva was able to
narrate the great epic of S$rimad-Bhagavatam, and by the mercy of
Vyasadeva, $n Sukadeva Gosvami was able to grasp the import. The
transcendental qualities of the Lord are so attractive that Srila Sukadeva
Gosvam1 became detached from being completely absorbed in impersonal
Brahman and positively took up the personal activity of the Lord.

Practically he was thrown from the impersonal conception of the
Absolute, thinking within himself that he had simply wasted so much time
in devoting himself to the impersonal feature of the Supreme, or in other
words, he realized more transcendental bliss with the personal feature than
the impersonal. And from that time, not only he himself became very
dear to the Visnu-jana or the devotees of the Lord, but also the Visnu-jana
became very dear to him. The devotees of the Lord, who do not wish to
kill the individuality of the living entities and who desire to become
personal servitors of the Lord, do not very much like the impersonalists,
and similarly the impersonalists, who desire to become one with the
Supreme, are unable to evaluate the devotees of the Lord. Thus from time
immemorial these two transcendental pilgrims have sometimes been com-
petitors. In other words, each of them likes to keep separate from the other
because of the ultimate personal and impersonal realizations. Therefore it
appears that Srila Sukadeva Gosvami also had no liking for the devotees.
But since he himself became a saturated devotee, he desired always the
transcendental association of the Visnu-jana, and the Visnu-jana also liked
his association since he became a personal Bhagavata. Thus both the son
and the father were completely cognizant of the transcendental knowledge
in Brahman, and afterwards both of them became absorbed in the personal
features of the Supreme Lord. The question as to how Sukadeva Gosvami

was attracted by the narration of the Bhdgavatam is thus completely

of Pandu.
PURPORT
Lord Krsna is so kind to the fallen souls that He personally incarnates
Himself amongst the different kinds of living entities and takes part with
them in daily activities. Any historical fact old or new which has a
connection with the activities of the Lord is to be understood as a
transcendental narration of the Lord. Without Krsna, all the supplementary
literatures like the Puranas and Mahabharata are simply stories or historical
facts. But with Krsna they become transcendental, and when we hear of
them we at once become transcendentally related with the Lord. Srimad-
Bhagavatam is also a Purana, but the special significance of this Purana
is that the activities of the Lord are central and not just supplementary


--- Page 346 ---
336 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 7
historical facts. Srimad-Bhagavatam is thus recommended by Lord Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu as the spotless Purana. There is a class of less
intelligent devotees of the Bhdgavata Purana who desire to relish at once
the activities of the Lord narrated in the Tenth Canto without first
understanding the primary cantos. They are under the false impression
that the other cantos are not concerned with Krsna and thus more
foolishly than intelligently take to the reading of the Tenth Canto. These
readers are specifically told herein that the other cantos of the Bhagavatam
are as important as the Tenth Canto. No one should try to go into the
matters of the Tenth Canto without having thoroughly understood the
purport of the other nine cantos. Krsna and His pure devotees like the
Pandavas are on the same plane. Krsna is not without His devotees of all
the rasas, and the pure devotees like the Pandavas or others are not
without Krsna. The devotees and the Lord are interlinked, and they cannot
be separated. Therefore talks about them are all Krsna-katha, or topics of
the Lord.

TRANSLATION

When the respective warriors of both camps, namely the Kauravas and
the Pandavas, were killed on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra and the dead
warriors obtained their deserved destinations, and when the son of
Dhrtarastra fell down lamenting, his spine broken, being beaten by the club
of Bhimasena, the son of Dronacarya [Asvatthama] beheaded the five
sleeping sons of Draupadi and delivered them as a prize to his master,
foolishly thinking that he would be pleased. Duryodhona, however, disap-
proved of the heinous act, and he was not pleased in the least.

PURPORT

Transcendental topics on the activities of Lord Sri Krsna in the Srimad-
Bhagavatam begin from the end of the Battlefield of Kuruksetra where the
Lord Himself spoke about Himself in the Bhagavad-gita. Therefore,
both the Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam are transcendental topics
of Lord Krsna. The Gita is Krsna-kathd, or topics of Krsna, because 11 is
spoken by the Lord, and the Bhagavatam is also Krsna-katha because it is
spoken about the Lord. Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu wanted everyone
to be informed of both Krspa-kathas by His order. Lord Krsna Caitanya
is Krsna Himself in the garb of a devotee of Krsna, and therefore the ver-
sions of both Lord Krsna and Sri Krsna Caitanya Mahaprabhu are identical.
Lord Caitanya desired that all who are born in India seriously understand
such Krsna-kathas and then after full realization preach the transcendental
message to everyone in all parts of the world. That will bring about the
desired peace and prosperity of the stricken world.

0 gentle lady, when I present you with the head of that brahmana,
after beheading him with arrows from my Gandiva bow, I shall then wipe
the tears from your eyes and pacify you. Then, after burning your sons’
bodies, you can take your bath standing on his head.
PURPORT
An enemy who sets fire to the house, administers poison, attacks all of
a sudden with deadly weapons, plunders wealth or usurps agricultural
fields, or entices one’s wife is called an aggressor. Such an aggressor, though
he be a brahmana or a so-called son of a brahmana, has to be punished in
all circumstances. When Arjuna promised to behead the aggressor named
Agvatthami, he knew well that A$vatthima was the son of a brahmana,
but because the so-called brahmana acted like a butcher, he was taken as
such, and there was no question of sin in killing such a brahmana’s son
who proved to be a villain.

by his daughter and began to follow her, which infuriated Siva, who
attacked Brahma with his trident. Brahmaji fled in fear of his life. As far
as arka is concerned, there is a reference in the Vamana Purana. There was
a demon by the name Vidyunmali who was gifted with a glowing golden
airplane which travelled to the back of the sun, and night disappeared
because of the glowing effulgence of this plane. Thus the sun-god became
angry, and with his virulent rays he melted the plane. This enraged Lord
Siva. Lord Siva then attacked the sun-god, who fled away and at last fell
down at Kasi (Varanasi), and the place became famous as Lolarka.

TRANSLATION
When the son of the brihmana [ Aévatthama] saw that his horses were
tired, he considered that there was no alternative for protection outside
his using the ultimate weapon, the brahmastra [nuclear weapon].
PURPORT

In the ultimate issue only, when there is no other alternative, the
nuclear weapon called the brahmadstra is applied. The word dvijatma-jah is
significant here because Aévatthama, although the son of Dronacarya, was
not exactly a qualified brahmapa. The most intelligent man is called a
brahmana, and it is not an hereditary title. Advatthama was also formerly
called the brahma-bandhu or the friend of a brahmana. Being a friend of a
brahmanpa does not mean that one is brahmapa by qualification. A friend


--- Page 352 ---
342 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 7
or son of a brahmana, when fully qualified, can be called a brahmana and
not otherwise. Since Asvatthama’s decision is immature, he is purposely
called herein the son of a brahmana.

although he did not know how to withdraw such weapons.
PURPORT
The subtle forms of material activities are finer than grosser methods
of material manipulation. Such subtle forms of material activities are
effected through purification of sound. The same method is adopted here
by chanting hymns to act as nuclear weapons.

Arjuna said: 0 my Lord SriKrsna, You are the almighty Personality of
Godhead. There is no limit to Your different energies. Therefore only You
are competent to instill fearlessness in the hearts of Your devotees. Every-
one in the flames of material miseries can find the path of liberation in
You only.
PURPORT
Arjuna is aware of the transcendental qualities of Lord Sri Krsna, as he
had already experienced them during the Kuruksetra War, in which


--- Page 354 ---
344 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 7
both of them were present. Therefore, Arjuna’s version of Lord Krsna is
authoritative. Krsna is almighty and is especially the cause of fearlessness
for the devotees. A devotee of the Lord is always fearless because of the
protection given by the Lord. Material existence is something like a
blazing fire in the forest, which can be extinguished by the mercy
of the Lord Sri Krsna. The spiritual master is the mercy representative
of the Lord. A person, therefore, burning in the flames of material exist-
ence, may receive the rains of mercy of the Lord through the transparent
medium of the self-realized spiritual master. The spiritual master by his
words can penetrate into the heart of the suffering person and inject
knowledge transcendental, which alone can extinguish the fire of material
existence.

PURPORT

The Lord states in the Bhagavad-gita that one who surrenders unto the

lotus feet of the Lord can get release from the clutches of nescience. Krsna


--- Page 355 ---
Text 24] The Son of Drona Punished 345
is just like the sun, and maya or material existence is just like darkness.
Wherever there is the light of the sun, darkness or ignorance at once
vanishes. The best means to get out of the world of ignorance is suggested
here. The Lord is addressed herein as the original Personality of Godhead.
From Him all other Personalities of Godhead expand. The all-pervasive
Lord Visnu is Lord Krsna’s plenary portion or expansion. The Lord
expands Himself in innumerable forms of Godhead and living beings,
along with His different energies. But Sri Krsna is the original pri-
meval Lord from whom everything emanates. The all-pervasive feature
of the Lord experienced within the manifested world is also a partial
representation of the Lord. Paramatma is, therefore, included within
Him. He is the Absolute Personality of Godhead. He has nothing to do
with the actions and reactions of the material manifestation because He is
far above the material creation. Darkness is a perverse representation of
the sun, and therefore the existence of darkness depends on the existence
of the sun, but in the sun proper there is no trace of darkness. As the sun
is full of light only, similarly the Absolute Personality of Godhead, beyond
the material existence, is full of bliss. He is not only full of bliss, but also
full of transcendental variegatedness. Transcendence is not at all static,
but full of dynamic variegatedness. He is distinct from the material nature
which is complicated by the three modes of material nature. He is parama,
or the chief. Therefore He is absolute. He has manifold energies, and
through His diverse energies He creates, manifests, maintains and destroys
the material world. In His own abode, however, everything is eternal and
absolute. The world is not conducted by the energies or powerful agents
by themselves, but by the potent all-powerful with all energies.

And yet, though You are beyond the purview of the material energy,
You execute the four principles of liberation characterized by religion and
so on for the ultimate good of the conditioned souls.
PURPORT

The Personality of Godhead Sri Krsna out of His causeless mercy
descends on the manifested world without being influenced by the material
modes of nature. He is eternally beyond the material manifestations. He
descends out of His causeless mercy only to reclaim the fallen souls who
are captivated by the illusory energy. They are attacked by the material
energy, and they want to enjoy her under false pretexts, although in
essence the living entity is unable to enjoy. He is eternally the servitor of
the Lord, and when he forgets this position he thinks of enjoying the
material world, but factually he is in illusion. The Lord descends to eradi-
cate this false sense of enjoyment and thus reclaim conditioned souls back
to Godhead. That is the all-merciful nature of the Lord for the fallen souls.

Thus You descend as an avatira [incarnation] to remove the burden

PURPORT 3
It appears that the Lord is partial to His devotees. Everyone is related
with the Lord. He is equal to everyone, and yet He is more inclined to His
own men and devotees. The Lord is everyone’s father. No one can be His
father, and yet no one can be His son. His devotees are His kinsmen, and
His devotees are His relations. This is His transcendental pastime. It has
nothing to do with mundane ideas of relations, fatherhood or anything
like that. As mentioned above, the Lord is above the modes of material
nature, and thus there is nothing mundane about His kinsmen and relations
in devotional service.

TRANSLATION
The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: Know from Me that this is
the act of the son of Drona. He has thrown the hymns of nuclear energy
[brahmastra], and he does not know how to retract the glare. He has
helplessly done this, being afraid of imminent death.
PURPORT
The brahmastra is similar to the modern nuclear weapon manipulated
by atomic energy. The atomic energy works wholly on total combusti-
bility, and so the brahmastra also acts. It creates an intolerable heat similar
to atomic radiation, but the difference is that the atomic bomb is a gross
type of nuclear weapon, whereas the brahmastra is a subtle type of weapon
produced by chanting hymns. It is a different science, and in the days gone
by such science was cultivated in the land of Bharatavarsa. The subtle
science of chanting hymns is also material, but it has yet to be known by
the modern material scientists. Subtle material science is not spiritual, but


--- Page 359 ---
Text 28] The Son of Drona Punished 349
it has a direct relationship with the spiritual method, which is still subtler.
A chanter of hymns knew how to apply the weapon as well as how to
retract it. That was perfect knowledge. But the son of Dronacarya, who
made use of this subtle science, did not know how to retract. He applied
it, being afraid of his imminent death, and thus the practice was not only
improper but also irreligious. As a son of a brahmapa he should not have
made so many mistakes, and for such gross negligence of duty he was to
be punished by the Lord Himself.

O Arjuna, only another brahmastra can counteract this weapon. Since
you are expert in the military science, subdue this weapon's glare with
your own weapon.
PURPORT
For the atomic bombs there is no counterweapon to neutralize the
effects. But by subtle science the action of a brahmadstra can be counter-
acted, and those who were expert in the military science in those days
could counteract the brahmastra. The son of Dronacarya did not know the
art of counteracting the weapon, and therefore Arjuna was asked to
counteract it by the power of his own weapon.

Text 31] The Son of Drona Punished 351
TRANSLATION
When the rays of the two brahmastras combined, a great circle of
fire, like the disc of the sun, covered all outer space and the whole
firmament of planets.
PURPORT
The heat created by the flash of a brahmdstra resembles the fire in the
sun globe which is exhibited at the time of cosmic annihilation. The radia-
tion of atomic energy is very insignificant in comparison to the heat
produced by a brahmastra. The atomic bomb explosion can at utmost
blow up one globe, but the heat produced by the brahmastra can destroy
the whole cosmic situation. The comparison is, therefore, made to the
heat at the time of annihilation.

the universe. Although the brahmadstra was released on this earth, the heat

produced by the combination of both weapons covered all the universe,
and all the populations on all the different planets began to feel the heat
excessively and compared it with that of the samvartaka fire. No planet is,
therefore, without living beings, as less intelligent materialistic men think.

Thus seeing the disturbance of the general populace and the imminent

weapons, as Lord Sri Krsna desired.
PURPORT
The theory that the modern atomic bomb explosions can annihilate the
world is childish imagination. First of all, the atomic energy is not power-
ful enough to destroy the world. And secondly, ultimately it all rests on
the supreme will of the Supreme Lord because without His will or sanction
nothing canbe built up or destroyed. It is foolish also to think that natural
laws are ultimately powerful. Material nature’s law works under the direc-
tion of the Lord, as it is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita. The Lord says
there that natural laws. work under His supervision. The world can be
destroyed only by the will of the Lord and not by the whims of tiny
politicians. Lord Sri Krsna desired that the weapons released by both
Drauni and Arjuna be withdrawn, and it was carried out by Arjuna at

Arjuna, his eyes blazing in anger like two red balls of copper, dexterous-

PURPORT
Asvatthama’s mother, 10101, was bom in the family of Gautama. The
significant point in this sloka is that Asvatthama was caught and bound up
with ropes like an animal. According to Sridhara Svami, Arjuna was bound
to catch this son of a brahmana like an animal as a part of his duty
(dharma). This suggestion by Sridhara Svami is also confirmed in the later
statement of SrT Krsna. Aévatthima was a bona fide son of Dronacirya
and Krpi, but because he had degraded himself to a lower status of life, it
was proper to treat him as an animal and not as a brahmana.

TRANSLATION
After binding Asvatthama, Arjuna wanted to take him to the military
camp. The Personality of Godhead Sri Krsna, looking on with His lotus
eyes, spoke to angry Arjuna.
PURPORT
Both Arjuna and Lord Sif Krsna are described here in an angry mood,
but Arjuna’s eyes were like balls of red copper whereas the eyes of the
Lord are like the lotus. This means that the angry mood of Arjuna and
that of the Lord are not on the same level. The Lord is Transcendence,
and thus He is absolute in any stage. His anger is not like the anger of a
conditioned living being within the modes of qualitative material nature.
Because He is absolute, both His anger and pleasure are the same. His
anger is not exhibited in the three modes of material nature. It is only a
sign of His bent of mind towards the cause of His devotee because that is
His transcendental nature. Therefore, even if He is angry, the object of
anger is blessed. He is unchanged in all circumstances.

TRANSLATION

Lord Sri Krsna said: O Arjuna, you should not show mercy by re-
leasing this relative of a brahmana [brahma-bandhu], for he has killed
innocent boys in their sleep.

PURPORT

The word brahma-bandhu is significant. A person who happens to take
birth in the family of a brahmana but is not qualified to be called a
brahmana is addressed as the relative of a (01700771110, and not as a
brahmana. The son of a high court judge is not virtually a high court judge,
but there is no harm in addressing a high court judge’s son as a relative of
the Honorable Justice. Therefore, as by birth only one does not become a
high court judge, so also one does not become a brahmapa simply by
birthright but by acquiring the necessary qualifications of a brahmapa. As
the high court judgeship is a post for the qualified man, so also the post of
a brahmana is atlainable by qualification only. The sdstra enjoins that even
if good qualifications are seen in a person born in a family other than a
brahmapa, the qualified man has to be accepted as a brahmana, and simi-
larly if a person born in the family of a brahmana is void of brahminical
qualification, then he must be treated as a non-brahmana or, in better
terms, a relative of a brahmana. Lord Sri Krsna, the supreme authority of
all religious principles, the Vedas, has personally pointed out these differ-
ences, and He is about to explain the reason for this in the following $lokas.

A person who knows the principles of religion does not kill an enemy
who is careless, intoxicated, insane, asleep, afraid or devoid of his chariot.
Nor does he kill a boy, a woman, a foolish creature or a surrendered soul.
PURPORT
An enemy who does not resist is never killed by a warrior who knows
the principles of religion. Formerly battles were fought on the principles
of religion and not for the sake of sense gratification. If the enemy hap-
pened to be intoxicated, asleep, etc., as above mentioned, he was never to
be Killed. These are some of the codes of religious war. Formerly war was
never declared by the whims of selfish political leaders, but it was carried
out on religious principles free from all vices. Violence carried out on
religious principles is far superior to so-called nonviolence.

PURPORT
A life for a life is just punishment for a person who cruelly and shame-
lessly lives at the cost of another’s life. Political morality is to punish a


--- Page 367 ---
Text 38] The Son of Drona Punished 357
person by a life sentence in order to save a cruel person from going to hell.
That a murderer is condemned (0 a life sentence by the state is good for
the culprit because in his next life he will not have to suffer for his act of
murder. Such a life sentence for the murderer is the lowest possible
punishment offered to him, and it is said in the smrti sastras that men who
are punished by the king on the principle of a life for a life are purified
of all their sins, so much so that they may be eligible for being promoted
to the planets of heaven. According to Manu, the great author of civic
codes and religious principles, even the killer of an animal is to be
considered a murderer because animal food is never meant for the civilized
man, whose prime duty is to prepare himself for going back to Godhead.
He says that in the act of killing an animal, there is a regular conspiracy by
the party of sinners, and all of them are liable to be punished as murderers
exactly like a party of conspirators who kill a human being combinedly.
He who gives permission, he who kills the animal, he who sells the
slaughtered animal, he who cooks the animal, he who administers dis-
tribution of the foodstuff, and at last he who eats such cooked animal
food are all murderers, and all of them are liable to be punished by the
laws of nature. No one can create a living being despite all advancement
of material science, and therefore no one has the right to kill a living
being by one’s independent whims. For the animal eaters, the scriptures
have sanctioned restricted animal sacrifices only, and such sanctions are
there just to restrict the opening of slaughterhouses and not to encourage
animal killing. The procedure under which animal sacrifice is allowed
in the scriptures is good both for the animal sacrificed and the animal
eaters. It is good for the animal in the sense that the sacrificed animal
is at once promoted io a human form of life after being sacrificed
at the altar, and the animal eater is saved from grosser types of sins
(eating meats supplied by organized slaughterhouses which are ghastly
places for breeding all kinds of material afflictions to society, country and
to the people in general). The material world is itself a place always full of
anxieties, and by encouraging animal slaughter the whole atmosphere
becomes polluted more and more by war, pestilence, famine and many
other unwanted calamities.

family. The good name of Dronacarya is very much respected. Although he

Text 40] The Son of Drona Punished 359
joined the enemy camp, he was still held always in respect, for the
Pandavas and Arjuna saluted him before beginning the fight. There was
nothing wrong in that way. But the son of Dronicarya degraded himself
by committing acts which are never done by the dvijas or the twice-born
higher castes. Aévatthama, the son of Dronacarya, committed murder by
killing the five sleeping sons of Draupadi, by which he dissatisfied his
master Duryodhana, who never approved of the heinous act of killing
the five sleeping sons of the Pandavas. This means that Advatthama became
as assaulter of Arjuna’s own family members, and thus he was liable to be
punished by him. In the sastras, he who attacks without notice or kills
from behind or sets fire to another’s house or kidnaps one’s wife is
condemned to death. These facts are reminded by Krsna to Arjuna so that
he might take notice of them and do the needful.

360 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 7
PURPORT

Arjuna was a great soul undoubtedly, which is proved here also. He is
encouraged herein personally by the Lord to kill the son of Drona, but
Arjuna considers that the son of his great teacher should be spared, for he
happens 10 be the son of Dronacarya, even though he is an unworthy son.
He had done all sorts of heinous acts whimsically for no one’s benefit.

Lord Sri Krsna encouraged Arjuna outwardly just to test Arjuna’s sense
of duty. It is not that Arjuna was incomplete in the sense of his duty, nor
was Lord Sri Krsna unaware of Arjuna’s sense of duty. But Lord Sri Krsna
put to test many of His pure devotees just to magnify the sense of duty.
The gopis were put to such tests as well. Prahlada Maharaja also was put
to such a test. All pure devotees come out successful in the respective
tests by the Lord.

Sri Sita Gosvami said: Draupadi then saw Asvatthama, who was bound
with ropes like an animal and silent for having enacted the most inglorious
murder. Due to her female nature, and due to her being naturally good and
well-behaved, she showed him due respects as a brahmana.
PURPORT
Asvatthama was condemned by the Lord Himself, and he was treated
by Arjuna just like a culprit, not like the son of a brahmana or teacher. But
when he was brought before Srimati Draupadi, she, although begrieved
for the murder of her sons, and although the murderer was present before
her, could not withdraw the due respect generally offered to a brahmana


--- Page 372 ---
362 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 1, Ch. 7
or to the son of a brahmana. This is due to her mild nature as a woman.
The woman as a class is no better than a boy, and therefore, they have no
discriminatory power like a man. Asvatthama proved himself to be an
unworthy son of Dronacarya or of a brahmana, and for this reason he was
condemned by the greatest authority Lord Sri Krsna, and yet a mild
woman could not withdraw her natural courtesy for a brahmana.

Even to date, in a Hindu family a woman shows proper respect to the
brahmana caste, however fallen and heinous a brahma-bandhu may be.
But the men have begun to protest against brahma-bandhus who are born
in families of good brahmanes but by action are less than sidras.

The specific word used in this $loka is vama sva-bhava, mild and gentle
by nature. A good man or woman accepts anything very easily, but a
man of average intelligence does not do so. But anyway, we should not
give up our reason and discriminatory power just to be gentle. One must
have good discriminatory power to judge a thing on its merit. We should
not follow the mild nature of a woman and thereby accept that which is
not genuine. Asvatthima may be respected by a good-natured woman,
but that does not mean that he is as good as a genuine brahmana.

Text 44] The Son of Drona Punished 363
PURPORT

As soon as Aévatthama was brought before Draupadi, she thought it
intolerable that a brahmana should be arrested like a culprit and brought
before her in that condition, especially when the brihmana happened to
be a teacher’s son.

Arjuna arrested Asdvatthima knowing perfectly well that he was the son
of Dronacarya. Krsna also knew him to be so. but both of them condemned
the murderer without consideration of his being the son of a brahmapa.
According to revealed scriptures, a teacher or spiritual master is liable to
be rejected if he proves himself unworthy of the position of a guru or
spiritual master. A guru is called also an dcarya, or a person who has
personally assimilated all the essence of sastras and has helped his disciples
toadopt the ways. Aévatthama failed to discharge the duties of a brahmana
or teacher, and therefore he was liable to be rejected from the exalted
position of a brahmana. On this consideration, both Lord Sri Krsna and
Arjuna were right in condemning Asvatthama. But to a good lady like
Draupadi, the matter was considered not from the angle of sastric vision,
but as a matter of custom. By custom, Aévatthima was offered the same
respect as was offered to his father. It was so because generally the people
accept the son of a brahmana as a real brahmana, by sentiment only.
Factually the matter is different. A brahmana is accepted on the merit
of qualification and not on the merit of simply being the son of a brahmana.

But in spite of all this, Draupadi desired that Asvatthima be at once
released, and it was all the same a good sentiment for her. This means that
a devotee of the Lord can tolerate all sorts of tribulation personally, but
still such devotees are never unkind to others, even to the enemy. These
are the characteristics of one who is a pure devotee of the Lord.

TRANSLATION
it was by Dronacarya’s mercy that you learned the military art of
throwing arrows and the confidential art of controlling weapons.
PURPORT
Dhanur-veda or military science was taught by Dronacarya with all its
confidential secrets of throwing and controlling by Vedic hymns. Gross
military science is dependent on material weapons, but finer than that is
the art of throwing the arrows saturated with Vedic hymns, which act
more effectively than gross material weapons like machine guns or atomic
bombs. The control is by Vedic mantras, or the transcendental science of
sound. It is said in the R@mdyana that Maharaja Dasaratha, the father of
Lord Sri Rama, used to control arrows by sound only. He could pierce his
target with his arrow by hearing the sound only, without seeing the
object. So this is a finer military science than that of the gross material
military weapons used nowadays. Arjuna was taught all this, and therefore
Draupadi wished that Arjuna feel obliged to Acarya Drona for all these
benefits. And in the absence of Dronacarya, his son was the representative.
That was the opinion of the good lady Draupadi. It may be argued why
Dronacarya, a rigid bréhmapa, should be a teacher in military science.
But the reply is that a brahmana should become a teacher, regardless of
what his department of knowledge is. A learned brahmana should become
a teacher, a priest and a recipient of charity. A bona fide 01107710170 is
authorized to accept such professions.

He |Dronaciarya] is certainly still existing, being represented by his

PURPORT
The wife of Dronacarya, Krpi, is the sister of Krpacarya. A devoted
wife, who is according to revealed scripture the better half of her husband,
is justified to embrace voluntary death along with her husband if she is
without issue. But in the case of the wife of Dronacarya, she did not
undergo such a trial because she had her son, the representative of her
husband. A widow is so called if there is a son of her husband existing.
So in either case Aévatthama was the representative of Dronacirya, and
therefore killing Asvatthama would be like killing Dronacarya. That was
the argument of Draupadi against the killing of Asvatthama.

PURPORT
A slight insult for a respectable family is sufficient to invoke grief.
Therefore, a cultured man should always be careful in dealing with worship-
ful family members.

the point of motherly feelings as well as from the respectable position
held by the wife of Dronacarya.

rage burns up the whole body of the royal family and brings grief upon
all.
PURPORT
The brahmapa order of society, or the spiritually advanced caste or
community and the members of such highly elevated families, were always
held in great esteem by the other subordinate castes, namely the admin-
istrative Kingly order, mercantile order and the laborers.

Suta Gosvami said: O brahmanas, King Yudhisthira fully supported the
statements of the Queen, which were in accordance with the principles of
religion and were justified, glorious, full of mercy and equity and were
without duplicity.

PURPORT

Maharaja Yudhisthira, who was the son of Dharmaraja or Yamaraja, fully
supported the words of Queen Draupadi in asking Arjuna to release
Aévatthimi. One should not tolerate the humiliation of a member of a
great family. Arjuna and his family were indebted to the family of Dron-
dcarya because of Arjuna’s learning the military science from him. If
ingratitude were shown to such a benevolent family, it was not at all
justified from the moral standpoint. The wife of Dronacarya, who was the
half body of the great soul, must be treated with compassion, and she
should not be put into grief because of her son’s death. That is com-
passion. Such statements hy Draupadiare without duplicity because actions
should be taken with full knowledge. The feeling of equality was there
because Draupadi spoke out of her personal experience. A barren woman
cannot understand the grief of a mother. Draupadi was herself a mother,
and therefore her calculation of the depth of Krpr’s grief was quite to the
point. And it was glorious because she wanted to show proper respect to a
great family.

TRANSLATION
Caturbhujah [the four-armed one], or the Personality of Godhead,
after hearing the words of Bhima, Draupadi and others, saw the face of
His dear friend Arjuna, and He began to speak as if smiling.
PURPORT
Lord इत Krsna had two arms, and why He is designated 25 four-armed is
explained by Sridhara Svami. Both Bhima and Draupadi held opposite
views about killing Aévatthama. Bhima wanted him to be immediately
killed, whereas Draupadi wanted to save him. We can imagine Bhima
ready to kill while Draupadi is obstructing him. And in order to prevent
both of them, the Lord discovered another two arms. Originally, the
primeval Lord Sri Krsna displays only two arms, but in His Narayana
feature He exhibits four. In His Narayana feature He resides with His
devotees in the Vaikuntha planets, while in His original Sri Krsna feature
He resides in the Krsnaloka planet far, far above the Vaikuntha planets in
the spiritual sky. Therefore, if Sri Krsna is called caturbhujah, there is no
contradiction. If need be He can display hundreds of arms. as He exhibited
in His visva-rapa shown to Arjuna. Therefore, one who can display hun-
dreds and thousands of arms can also manifest four whenever needed.
When Arjuna was perplexed about what to do with Aévatthima, Lord
Sri Krsna, as very dear friend of Arjuna, voluntarily took up the matter
just to make a solution. And He was smiling also.

TRANSLATION
The Personality of Godhead Sri Krsna said: A friend of a brahmana is
not to be killed, but if he is an aggressor he must be killed. All these
rulings are in the scriptures, and you should act accordingly. You have to
fulfill your promise to your wife, and you must also act to the satisfaction
of Bhimasena and Me.
PURPORT
Arjuna was perplexed because Advatthima was to be killed as well as
spared according to different scriptures cited by different persons. As a
brahma-bandhu, or a worthless son of a brahmana. Asvatthama was not to be
killed, but he was at the same time an aggressor also. And according to the
rulings of Manu, an aggressor, even though he be a brahmana (and what to
speak of an unworthy son of a brahmana), is to be killed. Dronacarya was
certainly a brahmana in the true sense of the term, but because he stood
in the battlefield he was killed. But although Aévatthama was an aggressor,
he stood without any fighting weapons. The ruling is that an aggressor,
when he is without weapon or chariot, cannot be killed. All these were
certainly perplexities. Besides that, Arjuna had to keep the promise he had
made before Draupadi just to pacify her. But he also had to satisfy both
Bhima and Krsna, who advised killing him. This dilemma was present
before Arjuna, and the solution was awarded by Krsna.

Just then Arjuna could understand the motive of the Lord by His
equivocal orders, and thus with his sword he severed both hair and jewel
from the head of Aévatthama.
PURPORT
Contradictory orders of different persons are impossible to carry out.
Therefore a compromise was selected by Arjuna by his sharp intelligence,
and he separated the jewel from the head of Asvatthama which was as
good as cutting off his head, and yet his life was saved for all practical
purposes. Here Asvatthama is indicated as twice-born. Certainly he was
twice-born, but he fell down from his position, and therefore he was pro-
perly punished.

Thus being insulted, the humiliated Advatthama was simultaneously
killed and not killed by the intelligence of Lord Krsna and Arjuna.
