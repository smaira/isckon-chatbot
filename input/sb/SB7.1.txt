Preface

We must know the present need of human society. And what is that
need ? ‘Human society is no longer bounded by geographical limits to par-
ticular countries or communities. Human society is broader than in the
Middle Ages, and the world tendency is toward one state or one human
society. The ideals of spiritual communism, according to Srimad-
Bhagavatam, are based more or less on the oneness of the entire human
society, nay, on the entire energy of living beings. The need is felt by
great thinkers to make this a successful ideology. Srimad-Bhagavatam
will fill this need in human society. It begins, therefore, with the aphor-
ism of Vedanta philosophy (janmady asya yatah) to establish the ideal of
a common cause.

Human society, at the present moment, is not in the darkness of obli-
vion. It has made rapid progress in the field of material comforts, educa-
tion and economic development throughout the entire world. But there is
a pinprick somewhere in the social body at large, and therefore there are
large-scale quarrels, even over less important issues. There is need of a
clue as to how humanity can become one in peace, friendship and
prosperity with a common cause. Srimad-Bhagavatam will fill this need,
for it is a cultural presentation for the re-spiritualization of the entire
human society.

Srimad-Bhagavatam should be introduced also in the schools and col-
leges, for it is recommended by the great student devotee Prahlada
Maharaja in order to change the demonic face of society.

Disparity in human society is due to lack of principles in a godless
civilization. There is God, or the Almighty One, from whom everything
emanates, by whom everything is maintained and in whom everything is

merged to rest. Material science has tried to find the ultimate source of
creation very insufficiently, but it is a fact that there is one ultimate
source of everything that be. This ultimate source is explained rationally
and authoritatively in the beautiful Bhagavatam or Srimad-
Bhagavatam.

Srimad-Bhagavatam is the transcendental science not only for know-
ing the ultimate source of everything but also for knowing our relation
with Him and our duty towards perfection of the human society on the
basis of this perfect knowledge. It is powerful reading matter in the
Sanskrit language, and it is now rendered into English elaborately so that
simply by a careful reading one will know God perfectly well, so much so
that the reader will be sufficiently educated to defend himself from the
onslaught of atheists. Over and above this, the reader will be able to con-
vert others to accept God as a concrete principle.

Srimad-Bhagavatam begins with the definition of the ultimate source.
It is a bona fide commentary on the Vedanta-sitra by the same author,
Srila Vyasadeva, and gradually it develops into nine cantos up to the
highest state of God realization. The only qualification one needs to study
this great book of transcendental knowledge is to proceed step by step
cautiously and not jump forward haphazardly as with an ordinary
book. It should be gone through chapter by chapter, one after another.
The reading matter is so arranged with its original Sanskrit text, its
English transliteration, synonyms, translation and purports so that one is
sure to become a God realized soul at the end of finishing the first nine
cantos.

The Tenth Canto is distinct from the first nine cantos, because it deals
directly with the transcendental activities of the Personality of Godhead
Sri Krsna. One will be unable to capture the effects of the Tenth Canto
without going through the first nine cantos. The book is complete in
twelve cantos, each independent, but it is good for all to read them in
small installments one after another.

I must admit my frailties in presenting Srimad-Bhagavatam, but still
I am hopeful of its good reception by the thinkers and leaders of society
on the strength of the following statement of Srimad-Bhagavatam.

Introduction

“This Bhagavata Purana is as brilliant as the sun, and it has arisen
just after the departure of Lord Krsna to His own abode, accompanied by
religion, knowledge, etc. Persons who have lost their vision due to the
dense darkness of ignorance in the age of Kali shall get light from this
Purana.” (Srimad-Bhagavatam 1.3.43)

The timeless wisdom of India is expressed in the Vedas, ancient
Sanskrit texts that touch upon all fields of human knowledge. Originally
preserved through oral tradition, the Vedas were first put into writing
five thousand years ago by Srila Vyasadeva, the “literary incarnation of
God.” After compiling the Vedas, Vyasadeva set forth their essence in
the aphorisms known as Vedanta-sitras. Srimad-Bhagavatam is
Vyasadeva’s commentary on his own Vedanta-sitras. It was written in
the maturity of his spiritual life under the direction of Narada Muni, his
spiritual master. Referred to as “‘the ripened fruit of the tree of Vedic
literature,” Srimad-Bhagavatam is the most complete and authoritative
exposition of Vedic knowledge.

After compiling the Bhagavatam, Vyasa impressed the synopsis of it
upon his son, the sage Sukadeva Gosvami. Sukadeva Gosvami subse-
quently recited the entire Bhagavatam to Maharaja Pariksit in an assem-
bly of learned saints on the bank of the Ganges at Hastinapura (now
Delhi). Maharaja Pariksit was the emperor of the world and was a great
rajarsi (saintly king). Having received a warning that he would die
within a week, he renounced his entire kingdom and retired to the bank
of the Ganges to fast until death and receive spiritual enlightenment.
The Bhagavatam begins with Emperor Pariksit’s sober inquiry to
Sukadeva Gosvami:

“You are the spiritual master of great saints and
devotees. I am therefore begging you to show the
way of perfection for all persons, and especially for
one who is about to die. Please let me know what a
man should hear, chant, remember and worship.
and also what he should not do. Please explain all
this to me.”

xiii


--- Page 5 ---
xiv Srimad-Bhagavatam

Sukadeva Gosvami’s answer to this question, and numerous other
questions posed by Maharaja Pariksit, concerning everything from the
nature of the self to the origin of the universe, held the assembled sages
in rapt attention continuously for the seven days leading to the King’s
death. The sage Sata Gosvami, who was present on the bank of the
Ganges when Sukadeva Gosvami first recited Srimad-Bhagavatam, later
repeated the Bhagavatam before a gathering of sages in the forest of
Naimisaranya. Those sages, concerned about the spiritual welfare of the
people in general, had gathered to perform a long, continuous chain of
sacrifices to counteract the degrading influence of the incipient age of
Kali. In response to the sages’ request that he speak the essence of Vedic
wisdom, Sita Gosvami repeated from memory the entire eighteen thou-
sand verses of Srimad-Bhagavatam, as spoken by Sukadeva Gosvami to
Maharaja Pariksit.

The reader of Srimad-Bhagavatam hears Sita Gosvami relate the
questions of Maharaja Pariksit and the answers of Sukadeva Gosvami.
Also, Sata Gosvami sometimes responds directly to questions put by
Saunaka Rsi, the spokesman for the sages gathered at Naimisaranya. One
therefore simultaneously hears two dialogues: one between Maharaja
Pariksit and Sukadeva Gosvami on the bank of the Ganges, and another
at Naimisaranya between Sita Gosvami and the sages at Naimisaranya
Forest, headed by Saunaka Rsi. Furthermore, while instructing King
Pariksit, Sukadeva Gosvami often relates historical episodes and gives
accounts of lengthy philosophical discussions between such great souls as
the saint Maitreya and his disciple Vidura. With this understanding of
the history of the Bhagavatam, the reader will easily be able to follow its
intermingling of dialogues and events from various sources. Since
philosophical wisdom, not chronological order, is most important in the
text, one need only be attentive to the subject matter of Srimad-
Bhagavatam to appreciate fully its profound message.

It should also be noted that the volumes of the Bhagavatam need not
be read consecutively, starting with the first and proceeding to the last.
The translator of this edition compares the Bhagavatam to sugar
candy —wherever you taste it, you will find it equally sweet and
relishable.

This edition of the Bhagavatam is the first complete English transla-
tion of this important text with an elaborate commentary, and it is the

first widely available to the English-speaking public. It is the product of
the scholarly and devotional effort of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhakti-
vedanta Swami Prabhupada, the world’s most distinguished teacher of
Indian religious and philosophical thought. His consummate Sanskrit
scholarship and intimate familiarity with Vedic culture and thought as
well as the modern way of life combine to reveal to the West a magnifi-
cent exposition of this important classic.

Readers will find this work of value for many reasons. For those in-
terested in the classical roots of Indian civilization, it serves as a vast
reservoir of detailed information on virtually every one of its aspects.
For students of comparative philosophy and religion, the Bhagavatam
offers a penetrating view into the meaning of India’s profound spiritual
heritage. To sociologists and anthropologists, the Bhagavatam reveals the
practical workings of a peaceful and scientifically organized Vedic
culture, whose institutions were integrated on the basis of a highly
developed spiritual world view. Students of literature will discover the
Bhagavatam to be a masterpiece of majestic poetry. For students of psy-
chology, the text provides important perspectives on the nature of con-
sciousness, human behavior and the philosophical study of identity.
Finally, to those seeking spiritual insight, the Bhagavatam offers simple
and practical guidance for attainment of the highest self-knowledge and
realization of the Absolute Truth. The entire multivolume text, pre-
sented by the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, promises to occupy a significant
place in the intellectual, cultural and spiritual life of modern man for a
long time to come.

CHAPTER ONE
The Supreme Lord Is Equal to Everyone

In this chapter, in response to a question by Maharaja Pariksit, Sukadeva
Gosvami gives his conclusions concerning how the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, although the Supersoul, friend and protector of everyone,
killed the Daityas, the demons, for the sake of Indra, the King of heaven.
In his statements, he totally refutes the arguments of people in general
who accuse the Supreme Lord of partiality. Sukadeva Gosvami proves
that because the body of the conditioned soul is infected by the three
qualities of nature, dualities arise such as enmity and friendship, attach-
ment and detachment. For the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
however, there are no such dualities. Even eternal time cannot control
the activities of the Lord. Eternal time is created by the Lord, and it acts
under His control. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, therefore, is al-
ways transcendental to the influence of the modes of nature, maya, the
Lord’s external energy, which acts in creation and annihilation. Thus all
the demons killed by the Supreme Lord attain salvation immediately.

The second question raised by Pariksit Maharaja concerns how Sis-
upala, although inimical toward Krsna from his very childhood and al-
ways blaspheming Krsna, attained salvation in oneness when Krsna
killed him. Sukadeva Gosvami explains that because of their offenses at
the feet of devotees, two attendants of the Lord in Vaikuntha named Jaya
and Vijaya became Hiranyakasipu and Hiranyaksa in Satya-yuga, Ravana
and Kumbhakarna in the next yuga, Treta-yuga, and SiSupala and Dan-
tavakra at the end of Dvapara-yuga. Because of their fruitive acts, Jaya
and Vijaya agreed to become the Lord’s enemies, and when killed in that
mentality, they attained salvation in oneness. Thus even if one thinks of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead in envy, he attains salvation. What
then is to be said of devotees who always engage in the Lord’s service
with love and faith?

beloved; suhrt—friend; brahman—O brahmana (Sukadeva);
bhatanam—toward all living entities; bhagauwin—the Supreme Lord,
Visnu; svayam—Himself; indrasya—of Indra; arthe—for the benefit;
katham—how; daityan—the demons; avadhit—killed; visamah—par-

TRANSLATION
King Pariksit inquired: My dear brahmana, the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead, Visnu, being everyone’s well-wisher, is equal
and extremely dear to everyone. How, then, did He become partial
like a common man for the sake of Indra and thus kill Indra’s
enemies? How can a person equal to everyone be partial to some
and inimical toward others?
PURPORT
In Bhagavad-gita (9.29) the Lord says, samo ’harh sarva-bhiitesu na
me dvesyo sti na priyah: “I am equal to everyone. No one is dear to Me,
nor is anyone My enemy.” In the previous canto, however, it has been
observed that the Lord sided with Indra by killing the demons on his ac-
count (hata-putra ditih Sakra-parsni-grahena visnuna). Therefore, the
Lord was clearly partial to Indra, although He is the Supersoul in every-
one’s heart. The soul is extremely dear to everyone, and similarly the


--- Page 9 ---
Text 2] The Supreme Lord Is Equal to Everyone 3
Supersoul is also dear to everyone. Thus there cannot be any faulty ac-
tion on the part of the Supersoul. The Lord is always kind to all living
entities, irrespective of form and situation, yet He took the side of Indra
just like an ordinary friend. This was the subject of Pariksit Maharaja's
inquiry. As a devotee of Lord Krsna, he knew very well that Krsna can-
not be partial to anyone, but when he saw that Krsna acted as the enemy
of the demons, he was somewhat doubtful. Therefore he posed this ques-
tion to Sukadeva Gosvami for a clear answer.

A devotee cannot accept that Lord Visnu has material qualifications.
Maharaja Pariksit knew perfectly well that Lord Visnu, being transcen-
dental, has nothing to do with material qualities, but to confirm his con-
viction he wanted to hear from the authority Sukadeva Gosvami. Srila
Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says, samasya hatha vaisamyam:
since the Lord is equally disposed toward everyone, how can He be par-
tial? Priyasya katham asuresu prity-abhavah. The Lord, being the
Supersoul, is extremely dear to everyone. Why, then, should the Lord
display unsympathetic behavior toward the asuras? How is this impar-
tial? Suhrdas ca kathari tesv asauhardam. Since the Lord says that He is
suhrdam sarva-bhiatandm, the well-wisher of all living entities, how
could He act with partiality by killing demons? These questions arose in
the heart of Pariksit Maharaja, and therefore he inquired from Sukadeva
Gosvami.

TRANSLATION

Lord Visnu Himself, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the
reservoir of all pleasure. Therefore, what benefit would He derive
from siding with the demigods? What interest would He fulfill in
this way? Since the Lord is transcendental, why should He fear the
asuras, and how could He be envious of them?

PURPORT

We should always remember the distinction between spiritual and ma-
terial. That which is material is infected by material qualities, but these
qualities cannot touch that which is spiritual, or transcendental. Krsna is
absolute, whether He is in the material world or spiritual world. When
we see partiality in Krsna, this vision is due to His external energy.
Otherwise how could His enemies attain salvation after being killed by
Him? Everyone who deals with the Supreme Personality of Godhead
gradually acquires the qualities of the Lord. The more one advances in
spiritual consciousness, the less he is affected by the duality of material
qualities. The Supreme Lord, therefore, must certainly be freed from
these qualities. His enmity and friendship are external features pre-
sented by the material energy. He is always transcendental. He is ab-
solute, whether He kills or bestows His favor.

Envy and friendship arise in one who is imperfect. We fear our
enemies because in the material world we are always in need of help. The
Lord, however, does not need anyone’s help, for He is atrnarama. The
Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (9.26):

patra pusparh phalar toyarn
yo me bhaktya prayacchati
tad ahah bhakty-upahrtam
asnami prayatatmanah
“If a devotee offers Me with devotion a little leaf, a flower, fruit or
water, I shall accept it.”” Why does the Lord say this? Is He dependent on


--- Page 11 ---
Text 3] The Supreme Lord Is Equal to Everyone 5
the offering of the devotee? He is not actually dependent, but He likes to
be dependent upon His devotee. This is His mercy. Similarly, He does not
fear the asuras. Thus there is no question of partiality in the Supreme
Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION

O greatly fortunate and learned brahmana, whether Narayana is
partial or impartial has become a subject of great doubt. Kindly
dispel my doubt with positive evidence that Narayana is always
neutral and equal to everyone.

PURPORT

Since Lord Narayana is absolute, His transcendental qualities are de-
scribed as one. Thus His punishments and His offerings of favor are both
of the same value. Essentially, His inimical actions are not displays of en-
mity toward His so-called enemies, but in the material field one thinks
that Krsna is favorable to devotees and unfavorable to nondevotees.
When Krsna finally instructs in Bhagavad-gita, sarva-dharman paritya-
Jya mam ekari Saranari vraja, this is meant not only for Arjuna but for
every living entity within this universe.

always counteract the miseries of the materialistic way of life.
Therefore great sages like Narada always speak upon Srimad-
Bhagavatam because it gives one the facility to hear and chant
about the wonderful activities of the Lord. Let me offer my re-
spectful obeisances unto Srila Vyasadeva and then begin describ-
ing topics concerning the activities of Lord Hari.
PURPORT

In this verse Sukadeva Gosvami offers his respectful obeisances
krsnaya munaye, which means to Krsna Dvaipayana Vyasa. One must
first offer one’s respectful obeisances to one’s spiritual master. Sukadeva
Gosvami’s spiritual master is his father, Vyasadeva, and therefore he
first offers his respectful obeisances to Krsna Dvaipayana Vyasa and then
begins describing topics of Lord Hari.

Whenever there is an opportunity to hear about the transcendental ac-
tivities of the Lord, we must take it. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu recom-
mends, kirtaniyah sada harih: one should always engage in krsna-katha
by chanting and talking about Krsna and hearing about Him. That is the
only occupation of a Krsna conscious person.

TRANSLATION

The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu, is always transcen-
dental to material qualities, and therefore He is called nirguna, or
without qualities. Because He is unborn, He does not have a ma-
terial body to be subjected to attachment and hatred. Although the
Lord is always above material existence, through His spiritual
potency He appeared and acted like an ordinary human being, ac-
cepting duties and obligations, apparently like a conditioned soul.

PURPORT

So-called attachment, detachment and obligations pertain to the ma-
terial nature, which is an emanation from the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, but whenever the Lord descends and acts in this material
world, He does so in His spiritual position. Although His activities ma-
terially appear different, spiritually they are absolute and nondifferent.
Thus it is an imposition upon the Supreme Lord to say that He is envious
of anyone or friendly to anyone.

In Bhagavad-gita (9.11) the Lord clearly says, avajananti mam
miidha manusim tanum asritam: “Fools deride Me when I descend in a
human form.” Krsna appears on this earth or within this universe with-
out any change in His spiritual body or spiritual qualities. Indeed, He is
never influenced by the material qualities. He is always free from such
qualities, but He appears to act under material influence. This under-
standing is dropita, or an imposition. Therefore Krsna says, janma
karma ca me divyam: whatever He does, being always transcendental,
has nothing to do with material qualities. Evari yo vetti tattvatah: only
devotees can understand the truth of how He acts. The fact is that Krsna
is never partial to anyone. He is always equal to everyone, but because of
imperfect vision, influenced by material qualities, one imposes material
qualities upon Krsna, and when one does so he becomes a miidha, a fool.
When one can properly understand the truth, one becomes devoted and
nirguna, free from material qualities. Simply by understanding the ac-
tivities of Krsna one can become transcendental, and as soon as one is
transcendental he is fit to be transferred to the transcendental world.

TRANSLATION

My dear King Pariksit, the material qualities —sattva-guna, rajo-
guna and tamo-guna—all belong to the material world and do not
even touch the Supreme Personality of Godhead. These three
gunas cannot act by increasing or decreasing simultaneously.

PURPORT

The original position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is one of
equality. There is no question of His being influenced by sattva-guna,
rajo-guna or tamo-guna, for these material qualities cannot touch the
Supreme Lord. The Lord is therefore called the supreme vara. varah
paramah krsnah: He is the supreme controller. He controls the material
qualities (daivi hy esd gunamayl mama maya). Mayadhyaksena
prakrtih siiyate: material nature (prakrti) works under His order. How,
then, can He be under the qualities of prakrti? Krsna is never influenced
by the material qualities. Therefore there is no question of partiality in
the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION
When the quality of goodness is prominent, the sages and
demigods flourish with the help of that quality, with which they
are infused and surcharged by the Supreme Lord. Similarly, when
the mode of passion is prominent the demons flourish, and when
ignorance is prominent the Yaksas and Raksasas flourish. The
Supreme Personality of Godhead is present in everyone’s heart,
fostering the reactions of sattva-guna, rajo-guna and tamo-guna.
"PURPORT
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is not partial to anyone. The
conditioned soul is under the influence of the various modes of material
nature, and behind material nature is the Supreme Personality of God-
head; but one’s victory and loss under the influence of sattva-guna, rajo-
guna and tamo-guna are reactions of these modes, not of the Supreme
Lord’s partiality. Srila Jiva Gosvami, in the Bhagavata-sandarbha, has
clearly said:
sattvadayo na santise
yatra ca prakrta gunah
sa Suddhah sarva-suddhebhyah

According to this statement of the Bhagavata-sandarbha, the Supreme
Lord, being always transcendental to the material qualities, is never
affected by the influence of these qualities. This same characteristic is
also present in the living being, but because he is conditioned by material
nature, even the pleasure potency of the Lord is manifested in the condi-
tioned soul as troublesome. In the material world the pleasure enjoyed by
the conditioned soul is followed by many painful conditions. For in-
stance, we have seen that in the two great wars, which were conducted by
the rajo-guna and tamo-guna, both parties were actually ruined. The
German people declared war against the English to ruin them, but the
result was that both parties were ruined. Although the Allies were ap-
parently victorious, at least on paper, actually neither of them were vic-
torious. Therefore it should be concluded that the Supreme Personality
of Godhead is not partial to anyone. Everyone works under the influence
of various modes of material nature, and when the various modes are
prominent, the demigods or demons appear victorious under the in-
fluence of these modes.
Everyone enjoys the fruits of his qualitative activities. This is also
confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (14.11-13):
sarva-dvaresu dehe ’smin
prakasa upajayate
jAanarh yada tada vidyad
vivrddhar sattvam ity uta

--- Page 18 ---
12 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 1
tamasy etani jayante
vivrddhe kuru-nandana

“The manifestations of the modes of goodness can be experienced
when all the gates of the body are illumined by knowledge.

*‘O chief of the Bharatas, when there is an increase in the mode of pas-
sion, the symptoms of great attachment, uncontrollable desire, hanker-
ing, and intense endeavor develop.

“0 son of Kuru, when there is an increase in the mode of ignorance,
madness, illusion, inertia and darkness are manifested.”

The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is present in everyone’s
heart, simply gives the results of the increase in the various qualities, but
He is impartial. He supervises victory and loss, but He does not take part
in them.

The various modes of material nature do not work all at once. The in-
teractions of these modes are exactly like seasonal changes. Sometimes
there is an increment of rajo-guna, sometimes of tamo-guna and some-
times sattva-guna. Generally the demigods are surcharged with sattva-
guna, and therefore when the demons and the demigods fight, the
demigods are victorious because of the prominence of their sattva-guna
qualities. However, this is not the partiality of the Supreme Lord.

Text 9] The Supreme Lord Is Equal to Everyone 13
TRANSLATION
The all-pervading Personality of Godhead exists within the
heart of every living being, and an expert thinker can perceive
how He is present there to a large or small extent. Just as one can
understand the supply of fire in wood, the water in a waterpot, or
the sky within a pot, one can understand whether a living entity is
a demon or a demigod by understanding that living entity’s devo-
tional performances. A thoughtful man can understand how much
a person is favored by the Supreme Lord by seeing his actions.
PURPORT
In Bhagavad-gita (10.41) the Lord says:
yad yad vibhitimat sattvari
Srimad arjitam eva va
tat tad evavagaccha tvarn
mama tejo- m$a-sambhavam
“Know that all beautiful, glorious and mighty creations spring from but
a spark of My splendor.” We have the practical experience of seeing that
one person is able to do very wonderful things whereas another cannot
do those same things and cannot even do things that require only a little
common sense. Therefore, how much a devotee has been favored by the
Supreme Personality of Godhead can be tested by the activities the devo-
tee has performed. In Bhagavad-gita (10.10) the Lord also says:
tesarn satata-yuktandrn
bhajatarn priti-parvakam
dadami buddhi-yogarh tar
Yyena mam upayanti te
“To those who are constantly devoted and who worship Me with love, I
give the understanding by which they can come to Me.” This is very
practical. A teacher instructs the student if the student is capable of tak-
ing more and more instructions. Otherwise, in spite of being instructed
by the teacher, the student cannot make strides in his understanding.


--- Page 20 ---
14 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 1
This has nothing to do with partiality. When Krsna says (95077) satata-
yuktanarh bhajatarh priti-parvakam/ dadami buddhi-yogarn tam, this
indicates that Krsna is prepared to give bhakti-yoga to everyone, but one
must be capable of receiving it. That is the secret. Thus when a person
exhibits wonderful devotional activities, a thoughtful man understands
that Krsna has been more favorable to this devotee.

This is not difficult to understand, but envious persons do not accept
that Krsna has bestowed His favor upon a particular devotee in accor-
dance with his advanced position. Such foolish persons become envious
and try to minimize an advanced devotee’s activities. That is not
Vaispavism. A Vaisnava should appreciate the service rendered to the
Lord by other Vaisnavas. Therefore a Vaisnava is described in Srimad-
Bhagavatam as nirmatsara. Vaisnavas are never envious of other
Vaisnavas or of anyone else, and therefore they are called nirmat-
saranam satam.

As Bhagavad-gita informs us, one can understand how one is satu-
rated with sattva-guna, rajo-guna or tamo-guna. In the examples given
herewith, fire represents the mode of goodness. One can understand the
constitution of a container for wood, petrol or other inflammable sub-
stances by the quantity of the fire. Similarly, water represents rajo-guna,
the mode of passion. A small skin and the vast Atlantic Ocean both con-
tain water, and by seeing the quantity of water in a container one can
understand the size of the container. The sky represents the mode of ig-
norance. The sky is present in a small earthen pot and also in outer space.
Thus by proper judgment one can see who is a devata, or demigod, and
who is an asura, Yaksa or Raksasa according to the quantities of sattva-
guna, rajo-guna and tamo-guna. One cannot judge whether a person is a
devata, an asura or a Raksasa by seeing him, but a sane man can under-
stand this by the activities such a person performs. A general description
is given in the Padma Purana: visnu-bhaktah smrto daiva asuras tad-
viparyayah. A devotee of Lord Visnu is a demigod, whereas an asura or
Yaksa is just the opposite. An asura is not a devotee of Lord Visnu; in-
stead, for his sense gratification he is a devotee of the demigods, bhiitas,
pretas and so on. Thus one can judge who is a devata, who is a Riksasa
and who is an asura by how they conduct their activities.

The word datmanam in this verse means paramatmanam. The


--- Page 21 ---
Text 9] The Supreme Lord Is Equal to Everyone 15
Paramatma, or Supersoul, is situated in the core of everyone’s heart (an-
tatah). This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (18.61). Isvarah sarva-
bhatanar hrd-dese ’rjuna tisthati. The vara, the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, being situated in everyone’s heart, gives directions to every-
one in terms of one’s capabilities in taking the instructions. The instruc-
tions of Bhagavad-gita are open to everyone, but some people
understand them properly, whereas others understand them so im-
properly that they cannot even believe in the existence of Krsna, al-
though reading Krsna’s book. Although the Gita says sri-bhagavan
uvdca, indicating that Krsna spoke, they cannot understand Krsna. This
is due to their misfortune or incapability, which is caused by rajo-guna
and tamo-guna, the modes of passion and ignorance. It is because of
these modes that they cannot even understand Krsna, whereas an ad-
vanced devotee like Arjuna understands Him and glorifies Him, saying,
pararit brahma param dhama pavitrarh paramarm bhavan: “You are the
Supreme Brahman, the supreme abode and purifier.” Krsna is open to
everyone, but one needs the capability to understand Him.

By external features one cannot understand who is favored by Krsna
and who is not. According to one’s attitude, Krsna becomes one’s direct
adviser, or Krsna becomes unknown. This is not Krsna’s partiality; it is
His response to one’s ability to understand Him. According to one’s
receptiveness—whether one be a devata, asura, Yaksa or Raksasa—
Krsna’s quality is proportionately exhibited. This proportionate exhibi-
tion of Krsna’s power is misunderstood by less intelligent men to be
Krsna’s partiality, but actually it is no such thing. Krsna is equal to
everyone, and according to one’s ability to receive the favor of Krsna,
one advances in Krsna consciousness. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti
Thakura gives a practical example in this connection. In the sky there are
many luminaries. At night, even in darkness, the moon is extremely
brilliant and can be directly perceived. The sun is also extremely
brilliant. When covered by clouds, however, these luminaries are not
distinctly visible. Similarly, the more one advances in sattva-guna, the
more his brilliance is exhibited by devotional service, but the more one is
covered by rajo-guna and tamo-guna, the less visible his brilliance, for
he is covered by these qualities. The visibility of one’s qualities does not
depend on the partiality of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; it is due


--- Page 22 ---
16 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 1
to various coverings in different proportions. Thus one can understand
how far he has advanced in terms of sattva-guna and how much he is
covered by rajo-guna and tamo-guna.

When the Supreme Personality of Godhead creates different
types of bodies, offering a particular body to each living entity ac-
cording to his character and fruitive actions, the Lord revives all
the qualities of material nature —sattva-guna, rajo-guna and tamo-
guna. Then, as the Supersoul, He enters each body and influences
the qualities of creation, maintenance and annihilation, using sat-
tva-guna for maintenance, rajo-guna for creation and tamo-guna
for annihilation.


--- Page 23 ---
Text 11] The Supreme Lord Is Equal to Everyone 17
PURPORT

Although material nature is conducted by the three qualities—sattva-
guna, rajo-guna and tamo-guna—nature is not independent. As the
Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (9.10):

mayadhyaksena prakrtih
sityate sa-caracaram
hetunanena kaunteya
Jjagad viparivartate ।
“This material nature is working under My direction, 0 son of Kunti,
and it is producing all moving and unmoving beings. By its rule this
manifestation is created and annihilated again and again.” The different
changes in the material world take place as actions and reactions of the
three gunas, but above the three gunas is their director, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. In the various types of bodies given to the living
entities by material nature (yantranidhani mayaya), either sattva-guna,
rajo-guna or tamo-guna is prominent. The body is produced by material
nature according to the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Therefore it is said here, yada sisrksuh pura atmanah parah, indicating
that the body is certainly created by the Lord. Karmana daiva-netrena:
according to the karma of the living entity, a body is prepared under the
Supreme Lord’s supervision. Whether the body is of sattva-guna, rajo-
guna or tamo-guna, everything is done by the direction of the Supreme
Lord through the agency of the external energy (prthak sva-mayaya). In
this way, in different types of bodies, the Lord (vara) gives directions
as Paramatma, and again, to destroy the body, He employs the tamo-
guna. This is the way the living entities receive different types of bodies.

TRANSLATION

O great King, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the con-
troller of the material and spiritual energies, who is certainly the
creator of the entire cosmos, creates the time factor to allow the
material energy and the living entity to act within the limits of
time. Thus the Supreme Personality is never under the time factor
nor under the material energy.

PURPORT

One should not think that the Lord is dependent on the time factor. He
actually creates the situation by which material nature acts and by which
the conditioned soul is placed under material nature. Both the condi-
tioned soul and the material nature act within the time factor, but the
Lord is not subject to the actions and reactions of time, for time has been
created by Him. To be more clear, Srila Vi§vanatha Cakravarti Thakura
says that creation, maintenance and annihilation are all under the
supreme will of the Lord.

In Bhagavad-gita (4.7) the Lord says:

yada yada hi dharmasya
glanir bhavati bharata
abhyutthanam adharmasya
10027710710 772 srjamy aham

“Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O de-
scendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion —at that time I
descend Myself.” Since Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is
the controller of everything, when He appears He is not within the
limitations of material time (janma karma ca me divyam). In this verse
the words kalarh carantar srjatisa asrayam indicate that although the
Lord acts within time, whether sattva-guna, rajo-guna or tamo-guna is
prominent, one should not think that the Lord is under time’s control.


--- Page 25 ---
Text 12] The Supreme Lord Is Equal to Everyone 19
Time is within His control, for He creates time to act in a certain way; He
is not working under the control of time. The creation of the material
world is one of the Lord’s pastimes. Everything is fully under His con-
trol. Since creation takes place when rajo-guna is prominent, the Lord
creates the necessary time to give facilities for rajo-guna. Similarly, He
also creates the necessary times for maintenance and annihilation. Thus
this verse establishes that the Lord is not under the limitations of time.

As stated in the Brahma-samhita, Svarah paramah krsnah: Krsna is
the supreme controller. Sac-cid-ananda-vigrahah: He possesses a
blissful, spiritual body. Anadih: He is not subordinate to anything. As
the Lord confirms in Bhagavad-gita (7.7), mattah [00270407077 nanyat
kificid asti dhanaiijaya: “0 conqueror of wealth [Arjuna], there is no
truth superior to Me.” Nothing can be above Krsna, for He is the con-
troller and creator of everything.

The Mayavadi philosophers say that this material world is mithya,
false, and that one should therefore not bother about this mithya creation
(brahma satya jagan mithyd). But this is not correct. Here it is said,
satya-krt: whatever is created by the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
satyarn param, cannot be called mithya. The cause of the creation is
satya, true, so how can the effect of the cause be mithya? The very word
satya-krt is used to establish that everything created by the Lord is fac-
tual, never false. The creation may be temporary, but it is not false.

TRANSLATION

O King, this time factor enhances the sattva-guna. Thus al-
though the Supreme Lord is the controller, He favors the
demigods, who are mostly situated in sattva-guna. Then the
demons, who are influenced by tamo-guna, are annihilated. The
Supreme Lord induces the time factor to act in different ways, but
He is never partial. Rather, His activities are glorious, therefore
He is called Urusrava.

PURPORT

The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (9.29), samo ‘hari sarva-bhiitesu na
me dvesyo ’sti na priyah: “व envy no one, nor am I partial to anyone. I am
equal to all.” The Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot be partial; He
is always equal to everyone. Therefore when the demigods are favored
and the demons killed, this is not His partiality but the influence of the
time factor. A good example in this regard is that an electrician connects
both a heater and a cooler to the same electrical energy. The cause of the
heating and cooling is the electrician’s manipulation of the electrical en-
ergy according to his desire, but factually the electrician has nothing to
do with causing heat or cold, nor with the enjoyment or suffering that
results.

There have been many historical incidents in which the Lord killed a
demon, but the demon attained a higher position by the mercy of the
Lord. Piitana is an example. Piuitana’s purpose was to kill Krsna. 4ho
baki yam stana-kila-kiatam. She approached the house of Nanda
Maharaja with the purpose of killing Krsna by smearing poison on her
breast, yet when she was killed she attained the highest position, achiev-
ing the status of Krsna’s mother. Krsna is so kind and impartial that be-
cause he sucked Putana’s breast, He immediately accepted her as His
mother. This superfluous activity of killing Putana did not diminish the


--- Page 27 ---
Text 13] The Supreme Lord Is Equal to Everyone 21
Lord’s impartiality. He is suhrdam sarva-bhiatanam, the friend of every-
one. Therefore partiality cannot apply to the character of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, who always maintains His position as the
supreme controller. The Lord killed Patana as an enemy, but because of
His being the supreme controller, she attained an exalted position as His
mother. Srila Madhva Muni therefore remarks, kale kala-visaye ’pisita.
dehadi-karanatvat suranikam iva sthitarh sattvam. Ordinarily a mur-
derer is hanged, and in the Manu-sarhita it is said that a king bestows
mercy upon a murderer by killing him, thus saving him from various
kinds of suffering. Because of his sinful activities, such a murderer is
killed by the mercy of the king. Krsna, the supreme judge, deals with
matters in a similar way because He is the supreme controller. The con-
clusion, therefore, is that the Lord is always impartial and always very
kind to all living entities.

There are two classes of transcendentalists —the jiianis and the bhak-

but the [त्क do. SiSupala, however, was neither a jiiani nor a bhakta,
yet simply by envy of the Lord he attained an exalted position by merg-
ing into the Lord’s body. Certainly this was astonishing, and therefore
Maharaja Yudhisthira inquired about the cause for the Lord’s mysterious
mercy to Si$upala.

TRANSLATION

How was it possible for Sisupala and Dantavakra, in the presence
of many exalted persons, to enter very easily into the body of
Krsna, whose nature is difficult to attain?

PURPORT

Sisupala and Dantavakra were formerly Jaya and Vijaya, the
doorkeepers of Vaikuntha. Merging into the body of Krsna was not their
final destination. For some time they remained merged, and later they
received the liberations of saripya and salokya, living on the same
planet as the Lord in the same bodily form. The $astras give evidence
that if one blasphemes the Supreme Lord, his punishment is to remain in
hellish life for many millions of years more than one suffers by killing
many brahmanas. SiSupala, however, instead of entering hellish life, im-
mediately and very easily received sayujya-mukti. That such a privilege
had been offered to SiSupala was not merely a story. Everyone saw it hap-

Text 24] The Supreme Lord Is Equal to Everyone 29
TRANSLATION
The great sage Sri Naradaji said: O King, blasphemy and praise,
chastisement and respect, are experienced because of ignorance.
The body of the conditioned soul is planned by the Lord for
suffering in the material world through the agency of the external
energy.
PURPORT
In Bhagavad-gita (18.61) it is said:
iSvarah sarva-bhitanam
hrd-dese ’rjuna tisthati
bhramayan sarva-bhutani
yantrarudhani mayaya
“The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone’s heart, O Arjuna, and is
directing the wanderings of all living entities, who are seated as on a
machine, made of material energy.” A material body is manufactured by
the external energy according to the direction of the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead. The conditioned soul, being seated on this machine,
wanders throughout the universe, and because of his bodily conception
of life he only suffers. Actually the suffering of being blasphemed and
the enjoyment of being praised, the acceptance of a good welcome or of
chastisement by harsh words, are felt in the material conception of life;
but since the body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is not material
but sac-cid-ananda-vigraha, He is unaffected by insults or greetings,
blasphemy or prayers. Being always unaffected and complete, He does
not feel extra pleasure when offered nice prayers by the devotee, al-
though the devotee benefits by offering prayers to the Lord. Indeed, the
Lord is very kind to His so-called enemy because one who always thinks
of the Personality of Godhead as an enemy also benefits, although he
thinks of the Lord adversely. If a conditioned soul, thinking of the Lord
as an enemy or a friend, somehow or other becomes attached to the Lord,
he receives great benefit.

TRANSLATION
My dear King, the conditioned soul, being in the bodily concep-
tion of life, considers his body to be his self and considers every-
thing in relationship with the body to be his. Because he has this
wrong conception of life, he is subjected to dualities like praise
and chastisement.
PURPORT
Only when a conditioned soul accepts the body as himself does he feel
the effects of chastisement or praise. Then he determines one person to
be his enemy and another his friend and wants to chastise the enemy and
welcome the friend. This creation of friends and enemies is a result of
one’s bodily conception of life.

TRANSLATION

Because of the bodily conception of life, the conditioned soul
thinks that when the body is annihilated the living being is annihi-
lated. Lord Visnu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the
supreme controller, the Supersoul of all living entities. Because
He has no material body, He has no false conception of “I and
mine.” It is therefore incorrect to think that He feels pleasure or
pain when blasphemed or offered prayers. This is impossible for
Him. Thus He has no enemy and no friend. When He chastises the
demons it is for their good, and when He accepts the prayers of the
devotees it is for their good. He is affected neither by prayers nor
by blasphemy.

PURPORT

Because of being covered by material bodies, the conditioned souls, in-
cluding even greatly learned scholars and falsely educated professors, all
think that as soon as the body is finished, everything is finished. This is
due to their bodily conception of life. Krsna has no such bodily concep-
tion, nor is His body different from His self. Therefore, since Krsna has
no material conception of life, how can He be affected by material
prayers and accusations? Krsna’s body is described herewith as kaivalya,
nondifferent from Himself. Since everyone has a material bodily concep-
tion of life, if Krsna had such a conception what would be the difference
between Krsna and the conditioned soul? Krsna’s instructions in
Bhagavad-gita are accepted as final because He does not possess a ma-
terial body. As soon as one has a material body he has four deficiencies,
but since Krsna does not possess a material body, He has no deficiencies.
He is always spiritually conscious and blissful. Isvarah paramah krsnah


--- Page 38 ---
32 Srimad-Bhigavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 1
sac-cid-ananda-vigrahah: His form is eternal, blissful knowledge. Sac-
cid-ananda-vigrahah, ananda-cinmaya-rasa and kaivalya are the same.
Krsna can expand Himself as Paramatma in the core of everyone's
heart. In Bhagavad-gita (13.3) this is confirmed. Ksetrajiiari capi mari
viddhi sarva-ksetresu bharata: the Lord is the Paramatma —the atma or
Superself of all individual souls. Therefore it must naturally be con-
cluded that He has no defective bodily conceptions. Although situated in
everyone’s body, He has no bodily conception of life. He is always free
from such conceptions, and thus He cannot be affected by anything in
relation to the material body of the jiva.
Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (16.19):

tan aham dvisatah kriran

sarmsaresu naradhaman

ksipamy ajasram asubhan

asurisv eva yonisu

“Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among
men, are cast by Me into the ocean of material existence, into various
demoniac species of life.”” Whenever the Lord punishes persons like
demons, however, such punishment is meant for the good of the condi-
tioned soul. The conditioned soul, being envious of the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead, may accuse Him, saying, “Krsna is bad, Krsna is a
thief” and so on, but Krsna, being kind to all living entities, does not
consider such accusations. Instead, He takes account of the conditioned
soul’s chanting of “Krsna, Krsna so many times. He sometimes
punishes such demons for one life by putting them in a lower species,
but then, when they have stopped accusing Him, they are liberated in the
next life because of chanting Krsna’s name constantly. Blaspheming the
Supreme Lord or His devotee is not at all good for the conditioned soul,
but Krsna, being very kind, punishes the conditioned soul in one life for
such sinful activities and then takes him back home, back to Godhead.
The vivid example for this is Vrtrasura, who was formerly Citraketu
Maharaja, a great devotee. Because he derided Lord Siva, the foremost of
all devotees, he had to accept the body of a demon called Vrtra, but then
he was taken back to Godhead. Thus when Krsna punishes a demon or
conditioned soul, He stops that soul’s habit of blaspheming Him, and


--- Page 39 ---
Text 26] The Supreme Lord Is Equal to Everyone 33
when the soul becomes completely pure, the Lord takes him back to
Godhead.

TRANSLATION
Therefore by enmity or by devotional service, by fear, by affec-
tion or by lusty desire—by all of these or any one of them—if a
conditioned soul somehow or other concentrates his mind upon
the Lord, the result is the same, for the Lord, because of His
blissful position, is never affected by enmity or friendship.
PURPORT
From this verse one should not conclude that because Krsna is
unaffected by favorable prayers or unfavorable blasphemy one should
therefore blaspheme the Supreme Lord. This is not the regulative prin-
ciple. Bhakti-yoga means anukiilyena krsnanusilanam: one should serve
Krsna very favorably. This is the real injunction. Here it is said that al-
though an enemy thinks of Krsna unfavorably, the Lord is unaffected by
such antidevotional service. Thus He offers His benedictions even to Sié-
upiala and similarly inimical conditioned souls. This does not mean,
however, that one should be inimical toward the Lord. The stress is given
to the favorable execution of devotional service, not purposeful
blasphemy of the Lord. It is said:


--- Page 40 ---
34 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 1
nindarm bhagavatah Srmvarms
tat-parasya janasya va
tato napaiti yah so 108
yaty adhah sukrtac cyutah
One who hears blasphemy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His
devotees should immediately take action or should leave. Otherwise he
will be put into hellish life perpetually. There are many such injunctions.
Therefore as a regulative principle one should not be unfavorable toward
the Lord but always favorably inclined toward Him.

Siupala’s achievement of oneness with the Supreme Lord was dif-
ferent because Jaya and Vijaya, from the very beginning of their ma-
terial existence, were ordained to treat the Supreme Lord as an enemy
for three lives and then return home, back to Godhead. Jaya and Vijaya
inwardly knew that Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but
they purposely became His enemies to be delivered from material life.
From the very beginning of their lives they thought of Lord Krsna as an
enemy, and even though blaspheming Lord Krsna, they chanted the holy
name of Krsna constantly along with their inimical thoughts. Thus they
were purified because of chanting the holy name of Krsna. It is to be
understood that even a blasphemer can be freed from sinful activities by
chanting the holy name of the Lord. Certainly, therefore, freedom is
assured for a devotee who is always favorable to the service of the Lord.
This will be clear from the following verse. By rapt attention fixed upon
Krsna, one is purified, and thus one is delivered from material life.

Srila Viévanatha Cakravarti Thakura has very nicely explained the
word bhayena, which means “by fear.” When the gopis went to Krsna in
the dead of night, they certainly feared chastisement by their relatives —
their husbands, brothers and fathers—but nonetheless, not caring for
their relatives, they went to Krsna. There was certainly fear, but this
fear could not check their devotional service to Krsna.

One should not mistakenly think that Lord Krsna must be worshiped
by an inimical attitude like that of Siéupala. The injunction is
anukiilyasya grahanam pratikiilyasya varjanam: one should give up
unfavorable activities and accept only favorable conditions in devotional
service. Generally, if one blasphemes the Supreme Personality of God-
head he is punished. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (16.19):


--- Page 41 ---
Text 26] The Supreme Lord Is Equal to Everyone 35
tan aham dvisatah kriiran
samsaresu naradhaman
ksipamy ajasram asubhan
dsurisv eva yonisu
There are many such injunctions. One should not try to worship Krsna
unfavorably; otherwise he must be punished, at least for one life, to be
purified. As one should not try to be killed by embracing an enemy, a
tiger or a snake, one should not blaspheme the Supreme Personality of
Godhead and become His enemy in order to be put into hellish life.
The purpose of this verse is to emphasize that even the enemy of the
Lord can be delivered, not to speak of His friend. Srila Madhvacarya also
says in many ways that one should not blaspheme Lord Visnu through
one’s mind, words or actions, for a blasphemer will go to hellish life
along with his forefathers.
karmana manasa vaca
yo dvisyad visnum avyayam
majjanti pitaras tasya
narake sasvatth samah
In Bhagavad-gita (16.19-20) the Lord says:
tan aham dvisatah kriran
samsaresu naradhaman
ksipamy ajasram asubhan
asurisv eva yonisu
asurim yonim apanna
mudha janmani janmani
mam aprapyaiva kaunteya
tato yanty adhamar gatim
“Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among
men, are cast by Me into the ocean of material existence, into various
demoniac species of life. Attaining repeated birth amongst the species of
demoniac life, such persons can never approach Me. Gradually they sink


--- Page 42 ---
36 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 1
down to the most abominable type of existence.” One who blasphemes
the Lord is put into a family of asuras, in which there is every chance of
forgetting the service of the Lord. Lord Krsna further states in
Bhagavad-gita (9.11-12):
avajananti mar midha
manusim tanum asritam
pararih bhavam ajananto
mama bhita-mahesvaram
11701105, rascals, blaspheme the Supreme Lord because He appears ex-
actly like a human being. They do not know the unlimited opulence of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
moghasa mogha-karmano
mogha-jiiana vicetasah
raksasim a@suriri caiva
prakrtirh mohinir $ritah
Anything done by those who have taken the attitude of enemies will be
baffled (moghasah). If these enemies try to be liberated or to merge into
the existence of Brahman, if they desire to be elevated to the higher
planetary systems as karmis, or even if they desire to return home, back
to Godhead, they will certainly be baffled.

As for HiranyakaSipu, although he was extremely inimical toward the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, he always thought of his son, who was
a great devotee. Therefore by the grace of his son, Prahlada Maharaja,
HiranyakaSipu was also delivered by the Supreme Personality of
Godhead.

hiranyakasipus capi
bhagavan-nindaya tamah
vivaksur atyagat siinoh
prahladasyanubhavatah
The conclusion is that one should not give up pure devotional service.
For one’s own benefit, one should not imitate Hiranyakasipu or SiSupala.
This is not the way to achieve success.

TRANSLATION
Narada Muni continued: By devotional service one cannot
achieve such intense absorption in thought of the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead as one can through enmity toward Him. That
is my opinion.
PURPORT
Sriman Narada Muni, the topmost pure devotee, praises Krsna’s
enemies like SiSupala because their minds are always completely ab-
sorbed in Krsna. Indeed, he thinks himself deficient in the inspiration of
being feelingly absorbed in Krsna consciousness. This does not mean,
however, that the enemies of Krsna are more elevated than Krsna’s pure
devotees. In the Caitanya-caritamrta (Adi 5.205) Krsnadasa Kavirija
Gosvami also thinks of himself in such a humble way:
jagai madhai haite musi se papistha
purisera kita haite muni se laghistha
“I am a worse sinner than Jagai and Madhai and am even lower than the
worms in the stool.” A pure devotee always thinks himself more defi-
cient than everyone else. If a devotee approaches Srimati Radharani to
offer some service to Krsna, even Srimati Radharani thinks that the de-
votee is greater than She. Thus Narada Muni says that according to his


--- Page 44 ---
38 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 1
opinion the enemies of Krsna are better situated because they are fully
absorbed in thoughts of Krsna in terms of killing Him, just as a very
lusty man always thinks of women and their association.

The essential point in this connection is that one should be fully ab-
sorbed in thoughts of Krsna, twenty-four hours a day. There are many
devotees in raga-mdrga, which is exhibited in Vrndavana. Whether in
dasya-rasa, sakhya-rasa, vatsalya-rasa or madhurya-rasa, all the devo-
tees of Krsna are always overwhelmed by thoughts of Krsna. When
Krsna is away from Vrndavana tending the cows in the forest, the gopis,
in the madhurya-rasa, are always absorbed in thoughts of how Krsna
walks in the forest. The soles of His feet are so soft that the gopis would
not dare keep His lotus feet on their soft breasts. Indeed, they consider
their breasts a very hard place for the lotus feet of Krsna, yet those lotus
feet wander in the forest, which is full of thorny plants. The gopis are
absorbed in such thoughts at home, although Krsna is away from them.
Similarly, when Krsna plays with His young friends, mother Ya$oda is
very much disturbed by thoughts that Krsna, because of always playing
and not taking His food properly, must be getting weak. These are exam-
ples of the exalted ecstasy felt in Krsna’s service as manifested in
Vrndavana. This service is indirectly praised by Narada Muni in this
verse. Especially for the conditioned soul, Narada Muni recommends that
one somehow or other be absorbed in thoughts of Krsna, for that will
save one from all the dangers of material existence. Full absorption in
thought of Krsna is the highest platform of bhakti-yoga.

TRANSLATION
A grassworm confined in a hole of a wall by a bee always thinks
of the bee in fear and enmity and later becomes a bee simply be-
cause of such remembrance. Similarly, if the conditioned souls
somehow or other think of Krsna, who is sac-cid-ananda-vigraha,
they will become free from their sins. Whether thinking of Him as
their worshipable Lord or an enemy, because of constantly think-
ing of Him they will regain their spiritual bodies.
PURPORT
In Bhagavad-gita (4.10) the Lord says:
vita-raga-bhaya-krodha
man-maya mam updsritah
bahavo jiiana-tapasa
pita mad-bhavam agatah
“Being freed from attachment, fear and anger, being fully absorbed in
Me and taking refuge in Me, many, many persons in the past became
purified by knowledge of Me—and thus they all attained transcendental
love for Me.” There are two ways of constantly thinking of Krsna—as a


--- Page 46 ---
40 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 1
devotee and as an enemy. A devotee, of course, by his knowledge and
tapasya, becomes free from fear and anger and becomes a pure devotee.
Similarly, an enemy, although thinking of Krsna inimically, thinks of
Him constantly and also becomes purified. This is confirmed elsewhere in
Bhagavad-gita (9.30), where the Lord says:
api cet sudurdacaro
bhajate mam ananya-bhak
sadhur eva sa mantavyah
samyag vyavasito hi sah

“Even if one commits the most abominable actions, if he engages in
devotional service he is to be considered saintly because he is properly
situated.” A devotee undoubtedly worships the Lord with rapt attention.
Similarly, if an enemy (suduracarah) always thinks of Krsna, he also be-
comes a purified devotee. The example given here concerns the
grassworm that becomes beelike because of constantly thinking of the
bee that forces it to enter a hole. By always thinking of the bee in fear,
the grassworm starts to become a bee. This is a practical example. Lord
Krsna appears within this material world for two purposes — paritrandya
sadhinarh vinasaya ca duskrtam: to protect the devotees and annihilate
the demons. The sadhus and devotees certainly think of the Lord always,
but duskrtis, the demons like Karhsa and SiSupala, also think of Krsna in
terms of killing Him. By thinking of Krsna, both the demons and devo-
tees attain liberation from the clutches of material maya.

This verse uses the word maya-manuje. When Krsna, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, appears in His original spiritual potency
(sambhavamy atma-mayayda), He is not forced to accept a form made by
material nature. Therefore the Lord is addressed as vara, the controller
of maya. He is not controlled by maya. When a demon continuously
thinks of Krsna because of enmity toward Him, he is certainly freed
from the sinful reactions of his life. To think of Krsna in any way, in
terms of His name, form, qualities, paraphernalia or anything pertaining
to Him, is beneficial for everyone. Srnvatari sva-kathah krsnah punya-
Sravana-kirtanah. Thinking of Krsna, hearing the holy name of Krsna or
hearing the pastimes of Krsna will make one pure, and then he will be-
come a devotee. Our Krsna consciousness movement is therefore trying


--- Page 47 ---
Text 30] The Supreme Lord Is Equal to Everyone 41
to introduce the system of somehow or other letting everyone hear the
holy name of Krsna and take Krsna’s prasada. Thus one will gradually
become a devotee, and his life will be successful.

As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.33.39):

If a bona fide listener hears of Krsna’s pastimes with the gopis, which
seem to be lusty affairs, the lusty desires in his heart, which constitute


--- Page 48 ---
42 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 1
the heart disease of the conditioned soul, will be vanquished, and he will
become a most exalted devotee of the Lord. If one who hears of the gopis’
lusty behavior with Krsna becomes free from lusty desires, certainly the
gopis who approached Krsna became free from all such desires.
Similarly, Siéupala and others who were very much envious of Krsna and
who constantly thought of Krsna became free from envy. Nanda
Maharaja and mother Yasoda were fully absorbed in Krsna consciousness
because of affection. When the mind is somehow or other fully absorbed
in Krsna, the material part is very soon vanquished, and the spiritual
part—attraction to Krsna—becomes manifest. This indirectly confirms
that if one thinks of Krsna enviously, simply because of thinking of
Krsna he becomes free from all sinful reactions and thus becomes a pure
devotee. Examples of this are given in the following verse.

My dear King Yudhisthira, the gopis by their lusty desires,
Karnsa by his fear, SiSupala and other kings by envy, the Yadus by
their familial relationship with Krsna, you Pandavas by your great
affection for Krsna, and we, the general devotees, by our devo-

Text 32] The Supreme Lord Is Equal to Everyone 43
PURPORT

Different persons achieve different types of mukti—sayujya, salokya,
sariapya, samipya and sarsti—according to their own intense desire,
which is called bhava. Thus it is described here that the gopis, by their
lusty desires, which were based upon their intense love for Krsna, be-
came the most beloved devotees of the Lord. Although the gopis at
Vrndavana expressed their lusty desires in relationship with a paramour
(parakiya-rasa), they actually had no lusty desires. This is significant of
spiritual advancement. Their desires appeared lusty, but actually they
were not the lusty desires of the material world. Caitanya-caritamrta
compares the desires of the spiritual and material world to gold and iron.
Both gold and iron are metal, but there is a vast difference in their value.
The lusty desires of the gopis for Krsna are compared to gold, and ma-
terial lusty desires are compared to iron.

Karnsa and other enemies of Krsna merged into the existence of Brah-
man, but why should Krsna’s friends and devotees have the same posi-
tion? Krsna’s devotees attain the association of the Lord as His constant
companions, either in Vrndavana or in the Vaikuntha planets. Similarly,
although Narada Muni wanders in the three worlds, he has exalted devo-
tion for Narayana (aisvaryaman). The Vrsnis and Yadus and the father
and mother of Krsna in Vrndavana all have familial relationships with
Krsna; Krsna’s foster father and mother in Vrndavana, however, are
more exalted than Vasudeva and Devaki.

TRANSLATION

Somehow or other, one must consider the form of Krsna very
seriously. Then, by one of the five different processes mentioned
above, one can return home, back to Godhead. Atheists like King
Vena, however, being unable to think of Krsna’s form in any of
these five ways, cannot attain salvation. Therefore, one must some-
how think of Krsna, whether in a friendly way or inimically.

PURPORT

Impersonalists and atheists always try to circumvent the form of
Krsna. Great politicians and philosophers of the modern age even try to
banish Krsna from Bhagavad-gita. Consequently, for them there is no
salvation. But Krsna’s enemies think, ‘Here is Krsna, my enemy. I have
to kill Him.” They think of Krsna in His actual form, and thus they at-
tain salvation. Devotees, therefore, who constantly think of Krsna’s
form, are certainly liberated. The only business of the Mayavadi atheists
is to make Krsna formless, and consequently, because of this severe
offense at the lotus feet of Krsna, they cannot expect salvation. Srila
Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says in this connection: tena Sisupaladi-
bhinnah pratikila-bhavari didhisur yena iva narakam yatiti bhavah.
Except for SiSupala, those who go against the regulative principles cannot
attain salvation and are surely destined for hellish life. The regulative
principle is that one must always think of Krsna, whether as a friend or
enemy.

world.
PURPORT
Sisupila and Dantavakra were not ordinary demons, but were for-
merly personal associates of Lord Visnu. They apparently fell to this ma-
terial world, but actually they came to assist the Supreme Personality of
Godhead by nourishing His pastimes within this world.

Lord to fall again to this material world is impossible. I cannot
believe this.
PURPORT
In Bhagavad-gita (8.16) the Lord clearly states, mam upetya tu kaun-
teya punar janma na vidyate: one who is purified of material contamina-
tion and returns home, back to Godhead, does not return to this material
world. Elsewhere in Bhagavad-gita (4.9) Krsna says:
Jjanma karma ca me divyam
evari yo vetti tattvatah
tyaktva deharih punar janma
naiti mam eti so 'rjuna
“One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and ac-
tivities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this ma-
terial world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.” Maharaja
Yudhisthira, therefore, was surprised that a pure devotee could return to
this material world. This is certainly a very important question.

Text 35] The Supreme Lord Is Equal to Everyone 47
TRANSLATION

The bodies of the inhabitants of Vaikuntha are completely
spiritual, having nothing to do with the material body, senses or
life air. Therefore, kindly explain how associates of the Per-
sonality of Godhead were cursed to descend in material bodies like
ordinary persons.

PURPORT

This very significant question would be difficult for an ordinary per-
son to answer, but Narada Muni, being an authority, could answer it.
Therefore Maharaja Yudhisthira inquired from him, saying, etad
akhyatum arhasi: “only you can explain the reason.” From authoritative
sources it can be discerned that associates of Lord Visnu who descend
from Vaikuntha do not actually fall. They come with the purpose of
fulfilling the desire of the Lord, and their descent to this material world
is comparable to that of the Lord. The Lord comes to this material world
through the agency of His internal potency, and similarly, when a devo-
tee or associate of the Lord descends to this material world, he does so
through the action of the spiritual energy. Any pastime conducted by the
Supreme Personality of Godhead is an arrangement by yogamaya, not
mahamaya. Therefore it is to be understood that when Jaya and Vijaya
descended to this material world, they came because there was something
to be done for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Otherwise it is a fact
that no one falls from Vaikuntha.

Of course, a living entity who desires sayujya-mukti remains in
Krsna’s Brahman effulgence, which is dependent on Krsna’s body
(brahmano hi pratisthaham). Such an impersonalist who takes shelter of
the Brahman effulgence must surely fall down. This is stated in the
astra (Bhag. 10.2.32):

ye ‘nye ’ravindaksa vimukta-maninas
tvayy asta-bhavad avisuddha-buddhayah
aruhya krcchrena pararii pada tatah
patanty adho ’nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah
““O Lord, the intelligence of those who think themselves liberated but
who have no devotion is impure. Even though they rise to the highest


--- Page 54 ---
48 Srimad-Bhigavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 1
point of liberation by dint of severe penances and austerities, they are
sure to fall down again into material existence, for they do not take
shelter at Your lotus feet.” The impersonalists cannot reach the
Vaikuntha planets to become associates of the Lord, and therefore, ac-
cording to their desires, Krsna gives them sdyujya-mukti. However,
since sayujya-mukti is partial mukti, they must fall again to this material
world. When it is said that the individual soul falls from Brahmaloka,
this applies to the impersonalist.

From authoritative sources it is learned that Jaya and Vijaya were sent
to this material world to fulfill the Lord’s desire to fight. The Lord also
sometimes wants to fight, but who can fight with the Lord but a very con-
fidential devotee of the Lord? Jaya and Vijaya descended to this world to
fulfill the Lord’s desire. Therefore in each of their three births—first as
Hiranyiksa and Hiranyakaéipu, second as Ravana and Kumbhakarna,
and third as SiSupala and Dantavakra—the Lord personally killed them.
In other words, these associates of the Lord, Jaya and Vijaya, descended
to the material world to serve the Lord by fulfilling His desire to fight.
Otherwise, as Maharaja Yudhisthira says, asraddheya ivabhati: the state-
ment that a servant of the Lord could fall from Vaikuntha seems un-
believable. How Jaya and Vijaya came to this material world is explained
by Narada Muni as follows.

The purport is that the personal associates of Lord Vispu in
Vaikunthaloka are always liberated souls. Even if sometimes cursed or
blessed, they are always liberated and never contaminated by the ma-
terial modes of nature. Before their liberation to Vaikunthaloka they
possessed material bodies, but once they come to Vaikuntha they no
longer have them. Therefore even if the associates of Lord Visnu some-
times descend as if cursed, they are always liberated.

_ In this verse the word sarva-bhutatma-bhitam is very significant.
Isvarah sarva-bhitanar hrd-dese ’rjuna tisthati: the Lord is equally
situated in the core of everyone’s heart. Thus He cannot be envious of
anyone or friendly to anyone; for Him everyone is the same. Although
He is sometimes seen to punish someone, this is exactly like a father’s
punishing his child for the child’s welfare. The Supreme Lord’s punish-
ment is also a manifestation of the Lord’s equality. Therefore the Lord is
described as prasantar sama-darsanam. Although the Lord has to exe-
cute His will properly, He is equipoised in all circumstances. He is
equally disposed toward everyone.

In their last birth, Jaya and Vijaya did not become demons or Rak-
sasas. Instead they took birth in a very exalted ksatriya family related to
Krsna’s family. They became first cousins of Lord Krsna and were prac-
tically on an equal footing with Him. By personally killing them with His
own disc, Lord Krsna destroyed whatever sinful reactions were left in
them because of the curse of the brahmanas. Narada Muni explained to
Maharaja Yudhisthira that by entering Krsna’s body, SiSupala reentered
Vaikunthaloka as the Lord’s associate. Everyone had seen this incident.

Lord, having returned home, back to Godhead.

Whatever their position, certainly Jaya and Vijaya always thought of
Krsna. Therefore at the end of the mausala-lila, these two associates of
the Lord returned to Krsna. There is no difference between Krsna’s body
and Narayana’s body. Therefore although they visibly entered the body
of Krsna, they actually reentered Vaikunthaloka as the doorkeepers of
Lord Visnu. Through Lord Krsna’s body, they returned to Vaikuntha, al-
though they seemed to have attained sayujya-mukti in Krsna’s body.

TRANSLATION

Maharaja Yudhisthira inquired: O my lord, Narada Muni, why
was there such enmity between Hiranyakasipu and his beloved son
Prahlada Maharaja? How did Prahlada Maharaja become such a
great devotee of Lord Krsna? Kindly explain this to me.

PURPORT

All the devotees of Lord Krsna are called acyutdatma because they
follow in the footsteps of Prahlada Maharaja. Acyuta refers to the infalli-
ble Lord Visnu, whose heart is always infallible. Because the devotees are
attached to the Infallible, they are called acyutatma.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Seventh Canto, First
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “The Supreme Lord Is
Equal to Everyone.”

CHAPTER TWO
Hiranyakasipu, King of the Demons
As described in this chapter, after the annihilation of Hiranyaksa,
Hiranyaksa’s sons and his brother Hiranyakasipu were very much ag-
grieved. Hiranyaka$ipu reacted very sinfully by trying to diminish the
religious activities of people in general. However, he instructed his
nephews about a history just to diminish their aggrievement.

When the Supreme Personality of Godhead appeared as the boar and
killed HiranyakasSipu’s brother Hiranyiksa, Hiranyakasipu was very
much aggrieved. In anger, he accused the Supreme Personality of God-
head of being partial to His devotees and derided the Lord’s appearance
as Varaha to kill his brother. He began to agitate all the demons and Rak-
sasas and disturb the ritualistic ceremonies of the peaceful sages and
other inhabitants of earth. For want of the performance of 20770,
sacrifice, the demigods began wandering unseen on earth.

After finishing the ritualistic funeral ceremonies of his brother,
Hiranyakasipu began speaking to his nephews, quoting from the sastras
about the truth of life. To pacify them, he spoke as follows: “My dear
nephews, for heroes to die before the enemy is glorious. According to
their different fruitive activities, living entities come together within
this material world and are again separated by the laws of nature. We
should always know, however, that the spirit soul, which is different
from the body, is eternal, inadjustable, pure, all-pervading and aware of
everything. When bound by the material energy, the soul takes birth in
higher or lower species of life according to varying association and in this
way receives various types of bodies in which to suffer or enjoy. One’s
affliction by the conditions of material existence is the cause of happiness
and distress; there are no other causes, and one should not be aggrieved
upon seeing the superficial actions of karma.”

Hiranyakasipu then related a historical incident concerning a King
Suyajfia who resided in the country named Usinara. When the King was
killed, his queens, overwhelmed with grief, received instructions, which

59

60 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 2
HiranyakaSipu quoted to his nephews. Hiranyakasipu related an account
of a kuliriga bird pierced by the arrow of a hunter while lamenting for
his wife, who had also been shot by the same hunter. By narrating these
stories, HiranyakaSipu pacified his nephews and other relatives and
relieved them of lamentation. Thus having been pacified, Diti and
Rusabhanu, Hiranyakasipu’s mother and sister-in-law, engaged their
minds in spiritual understanding.

worshiped by the demigods, He has taken their side and helped
them kill Hiranyaksa.
*Both the demons and demigods understand the Supreme Personality of
Godhead to be the supreme master, but the demigods follow the master
whereas the demons defy Him. Thus the demigods and demons are com-
pared to the two co-wives of one husband. Each wife is the sapatni (co-
wife) of the other, and therefore the word sapatnaih is used here.


--- Page 70 ---
64 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 2
PURPORT
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (9.29), samo ’ham sarva-bhiitesu: the
Lord is equal to all living entities. Since the demigods and demons are
both living entities, how is it possible that the Lord was partial to one
class of living beings and opposed to another? Actually it is not possible
for the Lord to be partial. Nonetheless, since the demigods, the devotees,
always strictly follow the Supreme Lord’s orders, because of sincerity
they are victorious over the demons, who know that the Supreme Lord is
Visnu but do not follow His instructions. Because of constantly remem-
bering the Supreme Personality of Godhead, 19100, the demons
generally attain sayujya-mukti after death. The demon Hiranyakasipu
accused the Lord of being partial because the demigods worshiped Him,
but in fact the Lord, like the government, is not partial at all. The
government is not partial to any citizen, but if a citizen is law-abiding he
receives abundant opportunities from the state laws to live peacefully
and fulfill his real interests.

TRANSLATION

The Supreme Personality of Godhead has given up His natural
tendency of equality toward the demons and demigods. Although
He is the Supreme Person, now, influenced by maya, He has
assumed the form of a boar to please His devotees, the demigods,
just as a restless child leans toward someone. I shall therefore sever
Lord Visnu’s head from His trunk by my trident, and with the
profuse blood from His body I shall please my brother Hiranyaksa,
who was so fond of sucking blood. Thus shall I too be peaceful.

PURPORT

The defect of the demoniac mentality is expressed in this verse very
clearly. Hiranyakasipu thought that Visnu also becomes partial, like a
child whose mind is not steady or resolute. The Lord can change His
mind at any time, Hiranyakasipu thought, and therefore His words and
activities are like those of children. Actually, because the demons are
ordinary human beings, their minds change, and being materially condi-
tioned, they think that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is condi-
tioned also. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (9.11), avajananti mar
miidha manusim tanum asritam: “Fools deride Me when I descend in a
human form.”

Demons always think that Visnu can be killed. Therefore, being ab-
sorbed in thoughts of Visnu’s form to kill Him, at least they have the op-
portunity to think of Visnu unfavorably. Although they are not devotees,
their thinking of Visnu is effective, and thus they generally attain sayu-
Jya-mukti. Because the demons consider the Supreme Lord an ordinary


--- Page 72 ---
66 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 2
living being, they think that they can kill Lord Visnu as one might kill
an ordinary person. Another fact disclosed herein is that demons are
very much fond of sucking blood. Indeed, all of them are meat-eaters
and bloodsuckers.

Hiranyakasipu accused the Supreme Lord of having a restless mind
like that of a small child who can be induced to do anything if simply
offered some cakes and ldddus. Indirectly, this indicates the true position
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who says in Bhagavad-gita
(9.26):

patrari puspari phalari toyarn
yo me bhaktya prayacchati
tad ahari bhakty-upahrtam
asnami prayatatmanah
“If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit or water, I
will accept it.”” The Lord accepts the offerings of devotees because of
their transcendental love. Because they are in love with the Supreme
Lord, they do not eat anything without offering it first to the Lord. The
Lord does not hanker for a small leaf or flower; He has enough to eat. In-
deed, He is feeding all living entities. Nonetheless, because He is very
merciful and is bhakta-vatsala, very favorable to the devotees, He cer-
tainly eats whatever they offer Him with love and devotion. This quality
should not be misjudged to be childish. The highest quality of the
Supreme Lord is that He is bhakta-vatsala; in other words, He is always
extremely pleased with His devotees. As for the word maya, when used
in reference to the dealings of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and
His devotees, this word means “affection.” The actions of the Lord to
favor His devotees are not disqualifications but signs of His natural
affection.

As for. rudhira, or the blood of Lord Visnu, since there is no possibility
of severing Lord Visnu’s head from His body, there is no question of
blood. But the garland that decorates Visnu’s body is as red as blood.
When the demons achieve sayujya-mukti and leave behind their sinful
activities, they are blessed by Visnu’s garland, which is red like blood.
After attaining sa@yujya-mukti, the demons are sometimes promoted to
the Vaikuntha world, where they receive the reward of the Lord’s gar-
land prasada.

away.

The difference between the demigods and the demons is here ex-
plained. The demigods always follow the instructions of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, whereas the demons simply plan to disturb or
kill Him. Nevertheless, sometimes the demons very much appreciate the
full dependence of the demigods upon the mercy of the Lord. This is in-
direct glorification of the demigods by the demons.

down to the planet earth, which is flourishing due to brahminical
culture and a ksatriya government. These people engage in
austerity, sacrifice, Vedic study, regulative vows, and charity.
Destroy all the people thus engaged!

PURPORT

Hiranyakasipu’s main purpose was to disturb the demigods. He
planned first to kill Lord Visnu so that with Lord Visnu’s death the
demigods would automatically weaken and die. Another of his plans was
to disturb the residents of the planet earth. The peace and prosperity of
the residents of earth, and all the other planets, were maintained by the
brahmanas and ksatriyas. The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (4.13), catur-
varnyarh maya अको guna-karma-vibhagasah: “According to the three
modes of material nature and the work ascribed to them, the four divi-
sions of human society were created by Me.”” On all the planets there are
different types of residents, but the Lord recommends, referring es-
pecially to the planet earth, which is inhabited by human beings, that
society be divided into four varnas—brahmana, ksatriya, vaiSya and
Sidra. Before the advent of Lord Krsna on this earth, it is understood
that the earth was managed by the brahmanas and ksatriyas. The duty of
the brahmanas is to cultivate Samah (peacefulness), damah (self-
control), titiksa (tolerance), satyam (truthfulness), saucam (cleanliness)
and arjavam (simplicity), and then to advise the ksatriya kings how to


--- Page 75 ---
Text 10] Hiranyakas$ipu, King of the Demons 69
rule the country or planet. Following the instructions of the brahmanas,
the ksatriyas should engage the populace in austerity, sacrifices, Vedic
study and adherence to the rules and regulations established by Vedic
principles. They should also arrange for charity to be given to the
brahmanas, sannyasis and temples. This is the godly arrangement of
brahminical culture.

People are inclined to offer yajiia because unless sacrifices are offered
there will be insufficient rain (yajiiad bhavati parjanyah), which will
hamper agricultural activities (parjanyad anna-sambhavah). By in-
troducing brahminical culture, therefore, a ksatriya government should
engage people in performing yajiia, studying the Vedas and giving
charity. Thus the people will receive their necessities for life very easily,
and there will be no disturbances in society. In this regard, Lord Krsna
says in Bhagavad-gita (3.12):

istan bhogan hi vo deva
dasyante yajaa-bhavitah
tair dattan apradayaibhyo
yo bhurikte stena eva sah
“In charge of the various necessities of life, the demigods, being satisfied
by the performance of yajiia [sacrifice], supply all necessities to man.
But he who enjoys these gifts, without offering them to the demigods in
return, is certainly a thief.”

The demigods are authorized supplying agents who act on behalf of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu. Therefore, they must be
satisfied by the performance of prescribed yajiias. In the Vedas, there are
different kinds of yajiias prescribed for different kinds of demigods, but
all are ultimately offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For one
who cannot understand what the Personality of Godhead is, sacrifice to
the demigods is recommended. According to the different material
qualities of the persons concerned, different types of yajiias are recom-
mended in the Vedas. Worship of different demigods is also on the same
basis — namely, according to different qualities. For example, the meat-
eaters are recommended to worship the goddess Kali, the ghastly form of
material nature, and before the goddess the sacrifice of animals is


--- Page 76 ---
70 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 2
recommended. But for those in the mode of goodness, the transcendental
worship of Visnu is recommended. Ultimately, all yajfias are meant for
gradual promotion to the transcendental position. For ordinary men, at
least five yajiias, known as pafica-mahayajiia, are necessary.

One should know, however, that all the necessities of life that human
society requires are supplied by the demigod agents of the Lord. No one
can manufacture anything. Consider, for example, all the eatables of
human society. These eatables include grains, fruits, vegetables, milk
and sugar for persons in the mode of goodness, and also eatables for the
nonvegetarians, such as meats, none of which can be manufactured by
men. Then again, take for example, heat, light, water and air, which are
also necessities of life—none of them can be manufactured by human
society. Without the Supreme Lord, there can be no profuse sunlight,
moonlight, rainfall or breeze, without which no one can live. Obviously,
our life is dependent on supplies from the Lord. Even for our manufac-
turing enterprises, we require so many raw materials like metal,
sulphur, mercury, manganese and so many essentials—all of which are
supplied by the agents of the Lord, with the purpose that we should make
proper use of them to keep ourselves fit and healthy for the purpose of
self-realization, leading to the ultimate goal of life, namely, liberation
from the material struggle for existence. This aim of life is attained by
performance of yajiias. If we forget the purpose of human life and
simply take supplies from the agents of the Lord for sense gratification
and become more and more entangled in material existence, which is not
the purpose of creation, certainly we become thieves, and therefore we
are punished by the laws of material nature. A society of thieves can
never be happy, for they have no aim in life. The gross materialist
thieves have no ultimate goal of life. They are simply directed to sense
gratification; nor do they have knowledge of how to perform yajiias.
Lord Caitanya, however, inaugurated the easiest performance of yajiia,
namely the sarnkirtana-yajiia, which can be performed by anyone in the
world who accepts the principles of Krsna consciousness.

Hiranyaka$ipu planned to kill the inhabitants of earth so that yajiia
would stop and the demigods, being disturbed, would die automatically
when Lord Visnu, the yajiiesvara, was killed. These were the demoniac
plans of Hiranyakasipu, who was expert in such activities.

parayanam—the shelter.

TRANSLATION

The basic principle of brahminical culture is to satisfy Lord
Visnu, the personification of sacrificial and ritualistic ceremonies.
Lord Visnu is the personified reservoir of all religious principles,
and He is the shelter of all the demigods, the great pitas, and the
people in general. When the brahmanas are killed, no one will ex-
ist to encourage the ksatriyas to perform yajfias, and thus the
demigods, not being appeased by yajfia, will automatically die.

PURPORT

Since Visnu is the central point of brahminical culture,
Hiranyaka$ipu’s plan was to kill Vispu, for if Visnu were killed,
naturally the brahminical culture would also be lost. With brahminical
culture lost, yajiia would no longer be performed, and for want of yajiia
the regular distribution of rainfall would cease (yajiad bhavati par-
janyah). Thus there would be disturbances all over the world, and


--- Page 78 ---
72 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 2
naturally the demigods would be defeated. From this verse we get a clear
indication of how human society is disturbed when the Vedic Aryan
civilization is killed and the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies performed by
the brahmanas are stopped. Kalau $idra-sambhavah: because the
population of the modern world consists mostly of $iidras, the brahmini-
cal culture is now lost and is extremely difficult to reestablish in a proper
way. Therefore Lord Caitanya has recommended the chanting of the holy
name of the Lord, which will revive brahminical culture very easily.
harer nama harer nama
harer namaiva kevalam
kalau nasty eva nasty eva
ndsty eva gatir anyatha
Because of the increment in demoniac population, people have lost
brahminical culture. Nor is there a ksatriya government. Instead, the
government is a democracy in which any $iidra can be voted into taking
up the governmental reigns and capture the power to rule. Because of the
poisonous effects of Kali-yuga, the Sastra (Bhag. 12.2.13) says, dasyu-
prayesu rajasu: the government will adopt the policies of dasyus, or
plunderers. Thus there will be no instructions from the brahmanas, and
even if there are brahminical instructions, there will be no ksatriya
rulers who can follow them. Aside from Satya-yuga, even formerly, in
the days when demons were flourishing, HiranyakaSipu planned to
destroy the brahminical culture and the ksatriya government and thus
create chaos all over the world. Although in Satya-yuga this plan was
very difficult to execute, in Kali-yuga, which is full of Sidras and
demons, the brahminical culture is lost and can be revived only by the
chanting of the maha-mantra. Therefore the Krsna consciousness move-
ment, or the Hare Krsna movement, has been inaugurated to revive
brahminical culture very easily so that people may become happy and
peaceful in this life and prepare for elevation in the next. In this regard,
Srila Madhvacarya quotes this verse from the Brahmanda Purana:
vipra-yajaadi-miilari tu
harir ity asurarih matam
harir eva hi sarvasya

Text 12] Hiranyakasipu, King of the Demons 73
“0 King, the demons think that Hari, Lord Visnu, exists because of the
brahmanas and yajiia, but factually Hari is the cause of everything in-
cluding the brahmanas and yajiia.”” Therefore, through the popularizing
of hari-kirtana, or the sarnkirtana movement, the brahminical culture
and ksatriya government will automatically come back, and people will
be extremely happy.

yatra yatra—wherever; dvijah—the brahmanas; gavah—the pro-
tected cows; vedah—the Vedic culture; varna-asrama—of the Aryan
civilization of four varnas and four asramas; kriyah—the activities; tam
tam —that; jana-padam—to the city or town; yata—go; sandipayata—
set fire; vricata—cut down (all the trees).
TRANSLATION
Immediately go wherever there is good protection for the cows
and brahmanas and wherever the Vedas are studied in terms of the
varnasrama principles. Set fire to those places and cut from the
roots the trees there, which are the source of life.
PURPORT
The picture of a proper human civilization is indirectly described
here. In a perfect human civilization there must be a class of men fully
trained as perfect brahmanas. Similarly, there must be ksatriyas to rule
the country very nicely according to the injunctions of the $dstras, and
there must be vaisyas who can protect the cows. The word gavah indi-
cates that cows should be given protection. Because the Vedic civilization
is lost, cows are not protected, but instead indiscriminately killed in
slaughterhouses. Such are the acts of demons. Therefore this is a


--- Page 80 ---
74 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 2
demoniac civilization. The varndsrama-dharma mentioned here is essen-
tial for human civilization. Unless there is a brahmana to guide, a
ksatriya to rule perfectly, and a perfect vaisya to produce food and pro-
tect the cows, how will people live peacefully? It is impossible.

Another point is that trees also should be given protection. During its
lifetime, a tree should not be cut for industrial enterprises. In Kali-yuga,
trees are indiscriminately and unnecessarily cut for industry, in particu-
lar for paper mills that manufacture a profuse quantity of paper for the
publication of demoniac propaganda, nonsensical literature, huge quan-
tities of newspapers and many other paper products. This is a sign of a
demoniac civilization. The cutting of trees is prohibited unless necessary
for the service of Lord Visnu. Yajidarthat karmano ’'nyatra loko yar
karma-bandhanah: “Work done as a sacrifice for Lord Visnu must be
performed, otherwise work binds one to this material world.” But if the
paper mills stop producing paper, one may argue, how can our ISKCON
literature be published? The answer is that the paper mills should
manufacture paper only for the publication of ISKCON literature be-
cause ISKCON literature is published for the service of Lord Visnu. This
literature clarifies our relationship with Lord Visnu, and therefore the
publication of ISKCON literature is the performance of yajia.
Yajiiarthat karmano ’nyatra loko yarn karma-bandhanah. Yajiia must
be performed, as indicated by the superior authorities. The cutting of
trees simply to manufacture paper for the publication of unwanted
literature is the greatest sinful act.

TRANSLATION
Thus the demons, being fond of disastrous activities, took
Hiranyakasipu’s instructions on their heads with great respect and
offered him obeisances. According to his directions, they engaged
in envious activities directed against all living beings.
PURPORT
The followers of demoniac principles, as described here, are
thoroughly envious of the general populace. In the present day, scientific
advancement exemplifies such envy. The discovery of nuclear energy has
been disastrous to people in general because demons all over the world
are manufacturing nuclear weapons. The word kadana-priyah is very
significant in this regard. The demoniac persons who want to kill the
Vedic culture are extremely envious of the feeble citizens, and they act in
such a way that ultimately their discoveries will be inauspicious for
everyone (jagato ‘hitah). The Sixteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gita fully
explains how the demons engage in sinful activities for the destruction of
the populace.

TRANSLATION

The demons set fire to the cities, villages, pasturing grounds,
cowpens, gardens, agricultural fields and natural forests. They
burned the hermitages of the saintly persons, the important mines
that produced valuable metals, the residential quarters of the
agriculturalists, the mountain villages, and the villages of the cow
protectors, the cowherd men. They also burned the government
capitals.

PURPORT

The word udyana refers to places where trees are especially grown to
produce fruits and flowers, which are most important for human civiliza-
tion. Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (9.26):

patrari puspari phalari toyari
yo me bhaktya prayacchati
tad aharih bhakty-upahrtam
asnami prayatatmanah

“If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit or water, I
will accept it.” Fruits and flowers are very much pleasing to the Lord. If
one wants to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he can simply
offer fruits and flowers, and the Lord will be pleased to accept them. Our
only duty is to please the Supreme Godhead (sariisiddhir hari-tosanam).
Whatever we do and whatever our occupation, our main purpose should
be to please the Supreme Lord. All the paraphernalia mentioned in this
verse is especially meant for the satisfaction of the Lord, not the satisfac-
tion of one’s senses. The government—indeed, the entire society —
should be structured in such a way that everyone can be trained to satisfy
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But unfortunately, especially in
this age, na te viduh svartha-gatimm hi visnum: people do not know that
the highest goal of human life is to please Lord ৬9100. On the contrary,
like demons, they simply plan to kill Visnu and be happy by sense
gratification.

TRANSLATION
Some of the demons took digging instruments and broke down
the bridges, the protective walls and the gates [gopuras] of the
cities. Some took axes and began cutting the important trees that
produced mango, jackfruit and other sources of food. Some of the
demons took firebrands and set fire to the residential quarters of
the citizens.
PURPORT
The cutting of trees is generally prohibited. In particular, trees that
produce nice fruit for the maintenance of human society should not be
cut. In different countries there are different types of fruit trees. In
India the mango and jackfruit trees are prominent, and in other places
there are mango trees, jackfruit trees, coconut trees and berry trees. Any
tree that produces nice fruit for the maintenance of the people should not
be cut at all. This is a éastric injunction.

TRANSLATION
Thus disturbed again and again by the unnatural occurrences
caused by the followers of Hiranyakasipu, all the people had to
cease the activities of Vedic culture. Not receiving the results of
yajiia, the demigods also became disturbed. They left their resi-
dential quarters in the heavenly planets and, unobserved by the
demons, began wandering on the planet earth to see the disasters.
PURPORT
As stated in Bhagavad-gita, the performance of yajiia brings recipro-
cal good fortune for both the human beings and the demigods. When the
performances of yajiia were stopped by the disturbances of the demons,
the demigods were naturally bereft of the results of yajiia and hampered
in executing their respective duties. Therefore they came down to the
planet earth to see how people had become disturbed and to consider
what to do.

“The bewildered soul, under the influence of the three modes of material
nature, thinks himself the doer of activities, which are in actuality car-
ried out by nature.” (Bg. 3.27) All living entities act exactly according
to the directions of prakrti, material nature, because in the material
world we are fully under a higher control. All the living entities in this
material world have come here only because they wanted to be equal to


--- Page 88 ---
82 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 2
Krsna in enjoyment and have thus been sent here to be conditioned by
material nature in different degrees. In the material world a so-called
family is a combination of several persons in one home to fulfill the
terms of their imprisonment. As criminal prisoners scatter as soon as
their terms are over and they are released, all of us who have temporarily
assembled as family members will continue to our respective destina-
tions. Another example given is that family members are like straws car-
ried together by the waves of a river. Sometimes such straws mix
together in whirlpools, and later, dispersed again by the same waves,
they float alone in the water.

Although Hiranyakasipu was a demon, he had Vedic knowledge and
understanding. Thus the advice given to his family members — his sister-
in-law, mother and nephews—was quite sound. The demons are con-
sidered highly elevated in knowledge, but because they do not use their
good intelligence for the service of the Lord, they are called demons. The
demigods, however, act very intelligently to satisfy the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead. This is confirmed in Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.13)
as follows:

atah pumbhir dvija-srestha
varnasrama-vibhagasah
svanusthitasya dharmasya
samsiddhir hari-tosanam
“O best among the twiceborn, it is therefore concluded that the highest
perfection one can achieve, by discharging his prescribed duties
(dharma) according to caste divisions and orders of life, is to please the
Lord Hari.” To become a demigod or to become godly, whatever one’s oc-
cupation, one must satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION

The spirit soul, the living entity, has no death, for he is eternal
and inexhaustible. Being free from material contamination, he can
go anywhere in the material or spiritual worlds. He is fully aware
and completely different from the material body, but because of
being misled by misuse of his slight independence, he is obliged to
accept subtle and gross bodies created by the material energy and
thus be subjected to so-called material happiness and distress.
Therefore, no one should lament for the passing of the spirit soul
from the body.

PURPORT

Hiranyaka$ipu very intelligently described the position of the soul.
The soul is never the body, but is always completely different from the
‘body. Being eternal and inexhaustible, the soul has no death, but when
the same pure soul desires to enjoy the material world independently, he
is placed under the conditions of material nature and must therefore ac-
cept a certain type of body and suffer the pains and pleasures thereof.
This is also described by Krsna in Bhagavad-gita (13.22). Karanam
guna-sarigo ‘sya sad-asad-yoni-janmasu: the living entity is born in dif-
ferent families or species of life because of being infected by the modes
of material nature. When conditioned by material nature, the living en-
tity must accept a certain type of body, which is offered by nature under
the direction of the Supreme Lord.

“The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone’s heart, O Arjuna, and is
directing the wanderings of all living entities, who are seated as on a
machine, made of the material energy.” (Bg. 18.61) The body is just
like a machine, and according to the living entity’s karma, he is offered a
particular type of machine to move here and there under the control of
material nature. This continues until he surrenders to the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead (mam eva ye prapadyante mayam eta taranti te).
Until he surrenders, the conditioned soul is carried from life to life by
the arrangement of material nature.

Because of the movements of the water, the trees on the bank of

when the eyes move because of some mental derangement, the
land appears to move also.
PURPORT
Sometimes, because of mental derangement, the land appears to be
moving. A drunkard, for example, or a person with heart disease, some-

Text 24] Hiranyakasipu, King of the Demons 85
times feels that the land is moving. Similarly, the reflections of trees in a
flowing river also appear to move. These are the actions of maya. Ac-
tually the living entity does not move (sthanur acalo ’yam). The living
entity does not take birth or accept death, but because of the transient
subtle and gross bodies, the living entity appears to move from one place
to another or be dead and gone forever. As the great Bengali Vaisnava
poet, Jagadananda Pandita, has said:
pisact paile yena mati-cchanna haya
maya-grasta jivera haya se bhava udaya
According to this statement from the Prema-vivarta, when a living entity
is conditioned by material nature, he is exactly like a person haunted by
a ghost. One should therefore understand the fixed position of the spirit
soul and how he is carried away by the waves of material nature to dif-
ferent bodies and different situations under lamentation and hankering.
One achieves the success of life when he understands the constitutional
position of his self and is undisturbed by the conditions created by ma-
terial nature (prakrteh kriyamanani gunaih karmani sarvasah).

In the same way, O my gentle mother, when the mind is agitated
by the movements of the modes of material nature, the living en-
tity, although freed from all the different phases of the subtle and
gross bodies, thinks that he has changed from one condition to
another.

PURPORT
As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.84.13):
yasyatma-buddhih kunape tri-dhatuke
sva-dhth kalatradisu bhauma-ijya-dhih
yat-tirtha-buddhih salile na karhicij
janesv abhijiiesu sa eva go-kharah

“A human being who identifies the body made of three elements as the
self, who considers the by-products of the body to be his kinsmen, who
considers the land of his birth worshipable, and who goes to a place of
pilgrimage simply to bathe rather than to meet men of transcendental
knowledge there, is to be considered like a cow or an ass.” Although
Hiranyaka$ipu was a great demon, he was not as foolish as the population
of the modern world. HiranyakaSipu had clear knowledge of the spirit
soul and the subtle and gross bodies, but now we are so degraded that
everyone, including the exalted scientists, philosophers and other
leaders, is under the bodily conception of life, which is condemned in the
Sastras. Sa eva go-kharah: such persons are nothing but cows and asses.

Hiranyaka$ipu advised his family members that although the gross
body of his brother Hiranyaksa was dead and they were aggrieved be-
cause of this, they should not lament for the great soul of Hiranyaksa,
who had already attained his next destination. Atma, the spirit soul, is al-
ways unchanged (avikalah puman). We are spirit souls, but when car-
ried away by mental activities (manodharma), we suffer from so-called
material conditions of life. This generally happens to nondevotees. Harav
abhaktasya kuto mahad-gunah: nondevotees may possess exalted ma-
terial qualities, but because they are foolish they have no good qualifica-
tions. The designations of the conditioned soul in the material world are

Text 26] Hiranyakasipu, King of the Demons 87
decorations of the dead body. The conditioned soul has no information of
the spirit and its exalted existence beyond the effects of the material
condition.

others to be outsiders. Because of this misconception, he suffers.
Indeed, the accumulation of such concocted material ideas is the
cause of suffering and so-called happiness in the material world.
The conditioned soul thus situated must take birth in different
species and work in various types of consciousness, thus creating
new bodies. This continued material life is called sarmmsara. Birth,
death, lamentation, foolishness and anxiety are due to such ma-
terial considerations. Thus we sometimes come to a proper under-
standing and sometimes fall again to a wrong conception of life.

smeared with blood, his heart pierced by the arrows of the enemy.
When he died he had wanted to show his prowess, and thus he had
bitten his lips, and his teeth remained in that position. His
beautiful lotuslike face was now black and covered with dust from
the battlefield. His arms, with his sword and other weapons, were
cut and broken. When the queens of the King of Usinara saw their
husband lying in that position, they began crying, ‘“O lord, now
that you have been killed, we also have been killed.” Repeating
these words again and again, they fell down, pounding their
breasts, at the feet of the dead King.
PURPORT
As stated here, rabhasa dasta-dacchadam: the dead King, while fight-
ing in anger, bit his lips to show his prowess, but nonetheless he was
killed by providence (vidhina). This proves that we are controlled by
higher authorities; our personal power or endeavor is not always
supreme. We must therefore accept the position offered to us by the
order of the Supreme.

PURPORT

Formerly, a ksatriya king was generally the husband of many wives,
and after the death of the king, especially in the battlefield, all the
queens would agree to accept saha-mdrana, dying with the husband who
was their life. When Pandu Maharaja, the father of the Pandavas, died,
his two wives—namely, the mother of Yudhisthira, Bhima and Arjuna
and the mother of Nakula and Sahadeva—were both ready to die in the
fire with their husband. Later, after a compromise was arranged, Kunti
stayed alive to care for the little children, and the other wife, Madri, was


--- Page 100 ---
94 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 2
allowed to die with her husband. This system of saha-marana continued
in India even until the time of British rule, but later it was discouraged,
since the attitude of wives gradually changed with the advancement of
Kali-yuga. Thus the system of saha-marana has practically been
abolished. Nevertheless, within the past fifty years I have seen the wife
of a medical practitioner voluntarily accept death immediately when her
husband died. Both the husband and wife were taken in procession in the
mourning cart. Such intense love of a chaste wife for her husband is a
special case.

TRANSLATION

The time was appropriate for the body to be burned, but the
queens, not allowing it to be taken away, continued lamenting for
the dead body, which they kept on their laps. In the meantime, the
sun completed its movements for setting in the west.

PURPORT

According to the Vedic system, if a person dies during the daytime it is
customary for his funeral ceremony to be performed before the sun sets,
regardless of whether he is burned or buried, and if he dies at night the
funeral must be completed before the next sunrise. Apparently the


--- Page 101 ---
Text 36] Hiranyakasipu, King of the Demons 95
queens continued lamenting for the dead body, the lump of matter, and
would not allow it to be taken away for burning. This illustrates the
strong grip of illusion among foolish persons who consider the body the
self. Women are generally considered less intelligent. Because of ig-
norance only, the queens thought of the dead body as their husband and
somehow or other thought that if the body were kept their husband
would remain with them. Such a conception of the self is certainly for go-
khara—cows and asses. We have actually seen that sometimes when a
cow’s calf has died the milkman cheats the cow by presenting before her
the dead body of her calf. Thus the cow, who would not otherwise allow
milking, licks the dead body of the calf and allows herself to be milked.
This substantiates the description of the sastra that a foolish man in the
bodily concept of life is like a cow. Not only do foolish men and women
consider the body the self, but we have even seen that the dead body of a
so-called yogi was kept for days by his disciples, who thought that their
guru was in samadhi. When decomposition began and a bad smell unfor-
tunately began to overwhelm the yogic power, the disciples allowed the
dead body of the so-called yogi to be burned. Thus the bodily concept of
life is extremely strong among foolish persons, who are compared to cows
and asses. Nowadays, great scientists are trying to freeze dead bodies so
that in the future these frozen bodies may again be brought to life. The
incident narrated by Hiranyakasipu from history must have taken place
millions of years ago because Hiranyaka$ipu lived millions of years ago
and was even then quoting from history. Thus the incident occurred
before HiranyakaSipu’s lifetime, but the same ignorance in the bodily
concept of life is still prevalent, not only among laymen but even among
scientists who think they will be able to revive frozen corpses.

Apparently the queens did not want to deliver the dead body for burn-
ing because they were afraid of dying with the dead body of their
husband.

TRANSLATION

‘While the queens were lamenting for the dead body of the King,
their loud cries were heard even from the abode of Yamnaraja.
Assuming the body of a boy, Yamaraja personally approached the
relatives of the dead body and advised them as follows.

PURPORT

Sometimes the living entity is forced to give up his body and enter
another one according to the judgment of Yamaraja. It is difficult,
however, for the conditioned soul to enter another body unless the pres-
ent dead body is annihilated through cremation or some other means.
The living being has attachment for the present body and does not want
to enter another, and thus in the interim he remains a ghost. If a living
being who has already left his body has been pious, Yamaraja, just to give
him relief, will give him another body. Since the living being in the body
of the King had some attachment to his body, he was hovering as a ghost,
and therefore Yamaraja, as a special consideration, approached the
lamenting relatives to instruct them personally. Yamaraja approached
them as a child because a child is not restricted but is granted admittance
anywhere, even to the palace of a king. Besides this, the child was speak-
ing philosophy. People are very much interested in hearing philosophy
when it is spoken by a child.

Sri Yamaraja said: Alas, how amazing it is! These persons, who
are older than me, have full experience that hundreds and thou-
sands of living entities have taken birth and died. Thus they
should understand that they also are apt to die, yet still they are
bewildered. The conditioned soul comes from an unknown place
and returns after death to that same unknown place. There is no
exception to this rule, which is conducted by material nature.
Knowing this, why do they uselessly lament?
PURPORT
The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (2.28):
avyaktadini bhitani
vyakta-madhyani bharata
avyakta-nidhanany eva
tatra ka paridevana
“All created beings are unmanifest in their beginning, manifest in their
interim state, and unmanifest again when they are annihilated. So what
need is there for lamentation?”


--- Page 104 ---
98 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 2

Accepting that there are two classes of philosophers, one believing in
the existence of the soul and the other not believing in its existence,
there is no cause for lamentation in either case. Nonbelievers in the exis-
tence of the soul are called atheists by followers of Vedic wisdom. Yet
even if for argument’s sake we accept the atheistic theory, there is still
no cause for lamentation. Apart from the separate existence of the soul,
the material elements remain unmanifested before creation. From this
subtle state of unmanifestation comes manifestation, just as from ether,
air is generated; from air, fire is generated; from fire, water is gener-
ated; and from water, earth becomes manifested. From the earth, many
varieties of manifestations take place. For example, a big skyscraper is
manifested from the earth. When it is dismantled, the manifestation be-
comes again unmanifested and remains as atoms in the ultimate stage.
The law of conservation of energy remains, but in the course of time
things are manifested and unmanifested —that is the difference. Then
what cause is there for lamentation, in either manifestation or un-
manifestation? Somehow or other, even in the unmanifested stage,
things are not lost. Both at the beginning and at the end, all elements
remain unmanifested, and this does not make any real material
difference.

If we accept the Vedic conclusion as stated in the Bhagavad-gita (an-
tavanta ime dehah) that these material bodies are perishable in due
course of time (nityasyoktah saririnah) but that the soul is eternal, then
we must remember always that the body is like a dress; therefore why
lament the changing of a dress? The material body has no factual exis-
tence in relation to the eternal soul. It is something like a dream. In a
dream we may think of flying in the sky or sitting on a chariot as a king,
but when we wake up we can see that we are neither in the sky nor
seated on the chariot. The Vedic wisdom encourages self-realization on
the basis of the nonexistence of the material body. Therefore, in either
case, whether one believes in the existence of the soul or one does not
believe in the existence of the soul, there is no cause for lamentation for
loss of the body.

In the Mahabharata it is said, adarsanad ihayatah punas cadarsanarm
gatah. This statement could support the theory of the atheistic scientist
that the child in the womb of the mother has no life but is simply a lump


--- Page 105 ---
Text 38] Hiranyaka$ipu, King of the Demons 99
of matter. To follow this theory, if the lump of matter is aborted by a
surgical operation, no life is killed; the body of a child is like a tumor,
and if a tumor is operated upon and thrown away, no sin is involved. The
same argument could be put forward in regard to the King and his
queens. The body of the King was manifested from an unmanifested
source, and again it became unmanifested from manifestation. Since the
manifestation exists only in the middle—between the two points of un-
manifestation—why should one cry for the body manifested in the
interim?

It is wonderful that these elderly women do not have a higher

though we are children and have been left to struggle in material
life, unprotected by father and mother, and although we are very


--- Page 106 ---
100 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 2
weak, we have not been vanquished or eaten by ferocious animals.
Thus we have a firm belief that the Supreme Personality of God-
head, who has given us protection even in the womb of the
mother, will protect us everywhere.
PURPORT
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (18.61), #svarah sarva-bhitanar hrd-dese
’rjuna tisthati: the Lord is present in the core of everyone’s heart. Thus
the Lord gives protection to everyone and gives the different types of
bodies the living entity wants to enjoy. Everything is done by the order
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore one should not lament
the birth and death of a living being, which have been arranged by the
Supreme Lord. Lord Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (15.15), sarvasya
cahar hrdi sannivisto mattah smrtir jianam apohanari ca: “1 am
seated in everyone’s heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge
and forgetfulness.” One must act according to the direction of the Lord
within the heart, but because the conditioned soul wants to act indepen-
dently, the Lord gives him the facility to act and experience the reac-
tions. The Lord says, sarva-dharman parityajya mam द्याः Saranari
vraja: “Give up all other duties and simply surrender unto Me.”” One
who does not abide by the orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead
is given the facility to enjoy this material world. Instead of restricting
him, the Lord gives the conditioned soul the opportunity to enjoy so that
by mature experience, after many, many births (bahinam janmanam
ante), he will understand that surrender to the lotus feet of Vasudeva is
the only duty of all living beings.

TRANSLATION

The boy addressed the women: 0 weak women! Only by the will
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is never diminished,
is the entire world created, maintained and again annihilated. This
is the verdict of the Vedic knowledge. This material creation, con-
sisting of the moving and nonmoving, is exactly like His plaything.
Being the Supreme Lord, He is completely competent to destroy
and protect.

PURPORT

In this regard the queens might argue, 10 our husband was protected
by the Supreme Personality of Godhead when in the womb, why has he
not been given protection now?”” To this question the answer is, ya ic-
chayesah srjatidam avyayo ya eva raksaty avalumpate ca yah. One can-
not argue with the activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The
Lord is always free, and therefore He can protect and can also annihilate.
He is not our order carrier; whatever He likes He will do. Therefore He
is the Supreme Lord. The Lord does not create this material world at any-
one’s request, and therefore He can annihilate everything merely by His
will. That is His supremacy. If one argues, “Why does He act in this
way?” the answer is that He can do so because He is supreme. No one can
question His activities. If one argues, “What is the purpose of this sinful
creation and annihilation?” the answer is that to prove His omnipotence
He can do anything, and no one can question Him. If He were answerable


--- Page 108 ---

to us concerning why He does something and why He does not, His
supremacy would be curtailed.

TRANSLATION
Sometimes one loses his money on a public street, where every-
one can see it, and yet his money is protected by destiny and not
seen by others. Thus the man who lost it gets it back. On the other
hand, if the Lord does not give protection, even money maintained
very securely at home is lost. If the Supreme Lord gives one pro-
tection, even though one has no protector and is in the jungle, one
remains alive, whereas a person well protected at home by relatives
and others sometimes dies, no one being able to protect him.
PURPORT
These are examples of the supremacy of the Lord. Our plans to protect
or annihilate do not act, but whatever He thinks of doing actually hap-

pens. The examples given in this regard are practical. Everyone has had
such practical experiences, and there are also many other clear examples.
For instance, Prahlada Maharaja said that a child is certainly dependent
on his father and mother, but in spite of their presence, the child is
harassed in many ways. Sometimes, in spite of a supply of good medicine
and an experienced physician, a patient does not survive. Therefore,
since everything is dependent on the free will of the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead, our only duty is to surrender unto Him and seek His
protection.

Every conditioned soul receives a different type of body accord-
ing to his work, and when the engagement is finished the body is
finished. Although the spirit soul is situated in subtle and gross
material bodies in different forms of life, he is not bound by them,


--- Page 110 ---
104 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 2
for he is always understood to be completely different from the
manifested body.
PURPORT
Here it is very plainly explained that God is not responsible for the liv-
ing entity’s accepting different types of bodies. One has to accept a body
according to the laws of nature and one’s own karma. Therefore the
Vedic injunction is that a person engaged in material activities should be
given directions by which he can intelligently apply his activities to the
service of the Lord to become free from the material bondage of repeated
birth and death (sva-karmana tam abhyarcya siddhim vindati
manavah). The Lord is always ready to give directions. Indeed, His
directions are elaborately given in Bhagavad-gita. If we take advantage
of these directions, then in spite of our being conditioned by the laws of
material nature, we shall become free to attain our original constitution
(mam eva ye prapadyante mayam etam taranti te). We should have firm
faith that the Lord is supreme and that if we surrender to Him, He will
take charge of us and indicate how we can get out of material life and
return home, back to Godhead. Without such surrender, one is obliged to
accept a certain type of body according to his karma, sometimes as an
animal, sometimes a demigod and so on. Although the body is obtained
and lost in due course of time, the spirit soul does not actually mix with
the body, but is subjugated by the particular modes of nature with which
he is sinfully associated. Spiritual education changes one’s consciousness
so that one simply carries out the orders of the Supreme Lord and be-
comes free from the influence of the modes of material nature.

idam—this; Sariram—body; purusasya—of the conditioned soul;
moha-jam—born of ignorance; yathd—just as; prthak—separate;
bhautikarn —material; fyate—is seen; grham—a house; yatha—just as;

TRANSLATION
Just as a householder, although different from the identity of
his house, thinks his house to be identical with him, so the condi-
tioned soul, due to ignorance, accepts the body to be himself, al-
though the body is actually different from the soul. This body is
obtained through a combination of portions of earth, water and
fire, and when the earth, water and fire are transformed in the
course of time, the body is vanquished. The soul has nothing to do
with this creation and dissolution of the body.
PURPORT
We transmigrate from one body to another in bodies that are products
of our illusion, but as spirit souls we always exist separately from ma-
terial, conditional life. The example given here is that a house or car is
always different from its owner, but because of attachment the condi-
tioned soul thinks it to be identical with him. A car or house is actually
made of material elements; as long as the material elements combine
together properly, the car or house exists, and when they are dis-
assembled the house or the car is disassembled. The spirit soul, however,
always remains as he is.

TRANSLATION

As fire, although situated in wood, is perceived to be different
from the wood, as air, although situated within the mouth and
nostrils, is perceived to be separate, and as the sky, although all-
pervading, never mixes with anything, so the living entity, al-
though now encaged within the material body, of which it is the
source, is separate from it.

PURPORT

In Bhagavad-gita the Supreme Personality of Godhead has explained
that the material energy and spiritual energy both emanate from Him.
The material energy is described as me bhinna prakrtir astadha, the
eight separated energies of the Lord. But although the eight gross and
subtle material energies —namely, earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, in-
telligence and false ego—are stated to be bhinna, separate from the Lord,
actually they are not. As fire appears separate from wood and as the air
flowing through the nostrils and mouth of the body appear separate from
the body, so the Paramatma, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, ap-
pears separate from the living being but is actually separate and not
separate simultaneously. This is the philosophy of acintya-bhedabheda-
tattva propounded by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. According to the reac-
tions of karma, the living being appears separate from the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead, but actually he is very intimately related with the


--- Page 113 ---
Text 44] Hiranyakasipu, King of the Demons 107
Lord. Consequently, even though we now seem neglected by the Lord,
He is actually always alert to our activities. Under all circumstances,
therefore, we should simply depend on the supremacy of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead and thus revive our intimate relationship with
Him. We must depend upon the authority and control of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION
Yamaraja continued: 0 lamenters, you are all fools! The person
named Suyajiia, for whom you lament, is still lying before you and
has not gone anywhere. Then what is the cause for your lamenta-
tion? Previously he heard you and replied to you, but now, not
finding him, you are lamenting. This is contradictory behavior,
for you have never actually seen the person within the body who
heard you and replied. There is no need for your lamentation, for
the body you have always seen is lying here.
PURPORT
This instruction by Yamaraja in the form of a boy is understandable
even for a common man. A common man who considers the body the self


--- Page 114 ---
108 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 2
is certainly comparable to an animal (yasyatma-buddhik kunape tri-
dhatuke . . . sa eva go-kharah). But even a common man can understand
that after death a person is gone. Although the body is still there, a dead
man’s relatives lament that the person has gone away, for a common man
sees the body but cannot see the soul. As described in Bhagavad-gita,
dehino ’smin yatha dehe: the soul, the proprietor of the body, is within.
After death, when the breath within the nostrils has stopped, one can
understand that the person within the body, who was hearing and reply-
ing, has now gone. Therefore, in effect, the common man concludes that
actually the spirit soul was different from the body and has now gone
away. Thus even a common man, coming to his senses, can know that the
real person who was within the body and was hearing and replying was
never seen. For that which was never seen, what is the need of
lamentation?

TRANSLATION

In the body the most important substance is the life air, but that
also is neither the listener nor the speaker. Beyond even the life
air, the soul also can do nothing, for the Supersoul is actually the
director, in cooperation with the individual soul. The Supersoul


--- Page 115 ---
Text 46] Hiranyakasipu, King of the Demons 109
conducting the activities of the body is different from the body
and living force.
PURPORT

The Supreme Personality of Godhead distinctly says in Bhagavad-gita
(15.15), sarvasya caharih hrdi sannivisto mattah smrtir jianam
apohanar ca: “I am seated in everyone’s heart, and from Me come
remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness.” Although the atma, or
soul, is present in every material body (dehino smin yatha dehe), he is
not actually the chief person acting through the senses, mind and so on.
The soul can merely act in cooperation with the Supersoul because it is
the Supersoul who gives him directions to act or not to act (mattah smrtir
jranam apohanariv ca). One cannot act without His sanction, for the
Supersoul is upadrasta and anumanta, the witness and sanctioner. One
who studies carefully, under the direction of a bona fide spiritual master,
can understand the real knowledge that the Supreme Personality of God-
head is actually the conductor of all the activities of the individual soul,
and the controller of their results as well. Although the individual soul
possesses the indriyas, or senses, he is not actually the proprietor, for the
proprietor is the Supersoul. Consequently the Supersoul is called
Hrsikesa, and the individual soul is advised by the direction of the
Supersoul to surrender to Him and thus be happy (sarva-dharmdn
parityajya mam ekarh $aranari vraja). Thus he can become immortal
and be transferred to the spiritual kingdom, where he will achieve the
highest success of an eternal, blissful life of knowledge. In conclusion,
the individual soul is different from the body, senses, living force and
the airs within the body, and above him is the Supersoul, who gives the
individual soul all facilities. The individual soul who renders everything
to the Supersoul lives very happily within the body.

TRANSLATION
The five material elements, the ten senses and the mind all com-
bine to form the various parts of the gross and subtle bodies. The
living entity comes in contact with his material bodies, whether
high or low, and later gives them up by his personal prowess. This
strength can be perceived in a living entity’s personal power to
possess different types of bodies.
PURPORT
The conditioned soul has knowledge, and if he wants to fully utilize
the gross and subtle bodies for his real advancement in life, he can do so.
It is therefore said here that by his high intelligence (svena tejasa), by
the superior power of superior knowledge achieved from the right
source —the spiritual master, or acarya—he can give up his conditional
life in a material body and return home, back to Godhead. However, if he
wants to keep himself in the darkness of this material world, he can do
so. The Lord confirms this as follows in Bhagavad-gita (9.25):
yanti deva-vratd devan
pitin yanti pitr-vratah
bhatani yanti bhatejya
yanti mad-yajino [08 mam
“Those who worship the demigods will take birth among the demigods;
those who worship ghosts and spirits will take birth among such beings;


--- Page 117 ---
Text 47] Hiranyakasipu, King of the Demons 111
those who worship ancestors go to the ancestors; and those who worship
Me will live with Me.”

The human form of body is valuable. One can use this body to go to
the higher planetary systems, to Pitrloka, or he can remain in this lower
planetary system, but if one tries he can also return home, back to God-
head. This prowess is given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead as
the Supersoul. Therefore the Lord says, mattah smrtir jianam
apohanam ca: “From Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetful-
ness.” If one wants to receive real knowledge from the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead, one can become free from bondage to repeated
acceptance of material bodies. If one takes to the devotional service of the
Lord and surrenders unto Him, the Lord is prepared to give one direc-
tions by which to return home, back to Godhead, but if one foolishly
wants to keep himself in darkness, he can continue in a life of material
existence.

results of his fruitive activities. Because of this covering, the spirit

soul is connected with the material energy and must accordingly
suffer material conditions and reversals, continually, life after life.
PURPORT

The living entity is bound by the subtle body, consisting of the mind,
intelligence and false ego. At the time of death, therefore, the position of
the mind becomes the cause for the next body. As confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita (8.6), yar yam vapi smaran bhavam tyajaty ante
kalevaram: at the time of death the mind sets the criteria for the spirit
soul’s being carried to another type of body. If a living being resists the
dictation of the mind and engages the mind in the loving service of the
Lord, the mind cannot degrade him. The duty of all human beings,
therefore, is to keep the mind always engaged at the lotus feet of the
Lord (sa vai manah krsna-padaravindayoh). When the mind is engaged
at the lotus feet of Krsna, the intelligence is purified, and then the intel-
ligence gets inspiration from the Supersoul (dadami buddhi-yogarir
tam). Thus the living entity makes progress toward liberation from ma-
terial bondage. The individual living soul is subject to the laws of
fruitive activity, but the Supersoul, Paramatma, is not affected by the
fruitive activities of the individual soul. As confirmed in the Vedic
Upanisad, the Paramatma and the jivatma, who are likened to two birds,
are sitting in the body. The jivatma is enjoying or suffering by eating the
fruits of the bodily activities, but the Paramatma, who is free from such
bondage, witnesses and sanctions the activities of the individual soul as
the individual soul desires.

tal concoction (daydream); svapnah—a dream; sarvam—everything;
aindriyakam —produced by the senses; mrsa—false.

TRANSLATION

It is fruitless to see and talk of the material modes of nature and
their resultant so-called happiness and distress as if they were fac-
tual. When the mind wanders during the day and a man begins to
think himself extremely important, or when he dreams at night
and sees a beautiful woman enjoying with him, these are merely
false dreams. Similarly, the happiness and distress caused by the
material senses should be understood to be meaningless.

PURPORT

The happiness and distress derived from the activities of the material
senses are not actual happiness and distress. Therefore Bhagavad-gita
speaks of happiness that is transcendental to the material conception of
life (sukham atyantikar yat tad buddhi-grahyam atindriyam). When
our senses are purified of material contamination, they become
atindriya, transcendental senses, and when the transcendental senses are
engaged in the service of the master of the senses, HrsikeSa, one can
derive real transcendental pleasure. Whatever distress or happiness we
manufacture by mental concoction through the subtle mind has no
reality, but is simply a mental concoction. One should therefore not
imagine so-called happiness through mental concoction. Rather, the best
course is to engage the mind in the service of the Lord, Hrsikesa, and
thus feel real blissful life.

There is a Vedic statement apama-somam amrta abhiima apsarobhir
viharama. With reference to such a conception, one wants to go to the
heavenly planets to enjoy with the young girls there and drink soma-
rasa. Such imaginary pleasure, however, has no value. As confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita (7.23), antavat tu phalam (क्का? tad bhavaty alpa-
medhasam: “Men of small intelligence worship the demigods, and their
fruits are limited and temporary.” Even if by fruitive activity or worship
of the demigods one is elevated to the higher planetary systems for sense
enjoyment, his situation is condemned in Bhagavad-gita as antavat,
perishable. The happiness one enjoys in this way is like the pleasure of


--- Page 120 ---
114 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 2
embracing a young woman in a dream; for some time it may be pleasing,
but actually the basic principle is false. The mental concoctions of happi-
ness and distress in this material world are compared to dreams because
of their falseness. All thoughts of obtaining happiness by using the ma-
terial senses have a false background and therefore have no meaning.

TRANSLATION
Those who have full knowledge of self-realization, who know
very well that the spirit soul is eternal whereas the body is perisha-
ble, are not overwhelmed by lamentation. But persons who lack
knowledge of self-realization certainly lament. Therefore it is dif-
ficult to educate a person in illusion.
PURPORT
According to the mimarisa philosophers, everything is eternal, nitya,
and according to the Sankhya philosophers everything is mithya, or
anitya—impermanent. Nonetheless, without real knowledge of atma,
the soul, such philosophers must be bewildered and must continue to
lament as Sadras. Srila Sukadeva Gosvami therefore said to Pariksit
Maharaja:

persons do not understand self-realization. One must therefore be edu-
cated in self-realization so that under any circumstances in life he will
remain steady in his vows.

The bird is lamenting for the mother of his children because the
mother naturally maintains and cares for the children. Yamarja,


--- Page 125 ---
Text 56] Hiranyakasipu, King of the Demons 119
however, in the guise of a small boy, has already explained that although
his mother left him uncared for and wandering in the forest, the tigers
and other ferocious animals had not eaten him. The real fact is that if the
Supreme Personality of Godhead protects one, even though one be
motherless and fatherless, one can be maintained by the good will of the
Lord. Otherwise, if the Supreme Lord does not give one protection, one
must suffer in spite of the presence of his father and mother. Another
example is that sometimes a patient dies in spite of a good physician and
good medicine. Thus without the protection of the Lord one cannot live,
with or without parents.

Another point in this verse is that fathers and mothers have protective
feelings for their children even in bird and beast society, not to speak of
human society. Kali-yuga, however, is so degraded that a father and
mother even kill their children in the womb on the plea of their scientific
knowledge that within the womb the child has no life. Prestigious medi-
cal practitioners give this opinion, and therefore the father and mother
of this day kill their children within the womb. How degraded human
society has become! Their scientific knowledge is so advanced that they
think that within the egg and the embryo there is no life. Now these so-
called scientists are receiving Nobel Prizes for advancing the theory of
chemical evolution. But if chemical combinations are the source of life,
why don’t the scientists manufacture something like an egg through
chemistry and put it in an incubator so that a chicken will come out?
What is their answer? With their scientific knowledge they are unable to

mayayapahrta-jianah, fools whose real knowledge has been taken
away. They are not men of knowledge, but they pose as scientists and
philosophers, although their so-called theoretical knowledge cannot pro-
duce practical results.

killed him.

death. Afflicted by a poor fund of knowledge, you do not know
that even if you lament for your dead husband for hundreds of
years, you will never get him back alive, and in the meantime your
lives will be finished.
PURPORT
Yamaraja once asked Maharaja Yudhisthira, “What is the most won-
derful thing within this world?” Maharaja Yudhisthira replied
(Mahabharata, Vana-parva 313.116):
ahany ahani bhiatani
gacchantiha yamalayam
Sesah sthavaram icchanti
kim ascaryam atah param
Hundreds and thousands of living entities meet death at every moment,
but a foolish living being nonetheless thinks himself deathless and does
not prepare for death. This is the most wonderful thing in this world.
Everyone has to die because everyone is fully under the control of ma-
terial nature, yet everyone thinks that he is independent, that whatever
he likes he can do, that he will never meet death but live forever, and so
on. So-called scientists are making various plans by which living entities
in the future can live forever, but while they are thus pursuing such
scientific knowledge, Yamaraja, in due course of time, will take them
away from their business of so-called research.

Hiranyakasipu said: While Yamaraja, in the form of a small boy,
was instructing all the relatives surrounding the dead body of
Suyajiia, everyone was struck with wonder by his philosophical
words. They could understand that everything material is tempor-
ary, not continuing to exist.
PURPORT
This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (2.18). Antavanta ime deha
nityasyoktah Saririnah: the body is perishable, but the soul within the
body is imperishable. Therefore the duty of those advanced in knowledge
in human society is to study the constitutional position of the imperisha-
ble soul and not waste the valuable time of human life in merely main-
taining the body and not considering life’s real responsibility. Every
human being should try to understand how the spirit soul can be happy
and where he can attain an eternal, blissful life of knowledge. Human
beings are meant to study these subject matters, not to be absorbed in
caring for the temporary body, which is sure to change. No one knows
whether he will receive a human body again; there is no guarantee, for
according to one’s work one may get any body, from that of a demigod to
that of a dog. In this regard, Srila Madhvacirya comments:

Only Janardana, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is ever existing,
but His creation, the material world, is temporary. Therefore everyone
who is captivated by the material energy and absorbed in thinking “Iam
this body, and everything belonging to this body is mine” is in illusion.
One should think only of being eternally a part of Janardana, and one’s
endeavor in this material world, especially in this human form of life,
should be to attain the association of Janardana by going back home, back
to Godhead.

TRANSLATION
Therefore none of you should be aggrieved for the loss of the
body —whether your own or those of others. Only in ignorance
does one make bodily distinctions, thinking “Who am I? Who are
the others? What is mine? What is for others?”’
PURPORT
In this material world, the conception of self-preservation is the first
law of nature. According to this conception, one should be interested in
his personal safety and should then consider society, friendship, love,
nationality, community and so on, which have all developed because of
the bodily conception of life and a lack of knowledge of the spirit soul.
This is called ajiana. As long as human society is in darkness and ig-
norance, men will continue to make huge arrangements in the bodily
conception of life. This is described by Prahlada Maharaja as bharam. In
the materialistic conception, modern civilization makes enormous ar-
rangements for huge roads, houses, mills and factories, and this is man’s
conception of the advancement of civilization. People do not know,
however, that at any time they themselves may be kicked out of the scene
and forced to accept bodies that have nothing to do with these enormous
houses, palaces, roads and automobiles. Therefore when Arjuna was


--- Page 131 ---
Text 60] HiranyakasSipu, King of the Demons 125
thinking in terms of his bodily relationships with his kinsmen, Krsna
immediately chastised him, saying, kutas tva kaSmalam 1027 visame
samupasthitam anarya-justam: “This bodily conception of life is befit-
ting the anaryas, the non-Aryans, who are not advanced in knowledge.”
An Aryan civilization is a civilization advanced in spiritual knowledge.
Not merely by stamping oneself an Aryan does one become an Aryan. To
keep oneself in the deepest darkness concerning spiritual knowledge and
at the same time claim to be an Aryan is a non-Aryan position. In this
connection, Srila Madhvacirya quotes as follows from the Brahma-
vaivarta Purana:
ka atma kah para iti dehady-apeksaya
na hi dehadir atma syan
na ca Satrur udiritah
ato daihika-vrddhau va
ksaye va kirh prayojanam
yas tu deha-gato jivah

dehadi-vyatiriktau tu

ata atma-vivrddhis tu
vasudeve ratih sthira
Satru-nasas tathajidna-
naso nanyah kathaficana
The purport is that as long as we are in this human form of body, our
duty is to understand the soul within the body. The body is not the self;
we are different from the body, and therefore there is no question of
friends, enemies or responsibilities in terms of the bodily conception of
life. One should not be very anxious about the body’s changing from
childhood to boyhood, from boyhood to old age and then to apparent


--- Page 132 ---
126 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 2
annihilation. Rather, one should be very seriously concerned about the
soul within the body and how to release the soul from the material
clutches. The living entity within the body is never annihilated;
therefore one should surely know that whether one has many friends or
many enemies, his friends cannot help him, and his enemies cannot do
him any harm. One should know that he is a spirit soul (aha
brahmasmi) and that the constitutional position of the soul is unaffected
by the changes of the body. In all circumstances, everyone, as a spirit
soul, must be a devotee of Lord Visnu and should not be concerned with
bodily relationships, whether with friends or with enemies. One should
know that neither we ourselves nor our enemies in the bodily conception
of life are ever killed.

PURPORT

When a relative dies one certainly becomes very much interested in
philosophy, but when the funeral ceremony is over one again becomes
attentive to materialism. Even Daityas, who are materialistic persons,
sometimes think of philosophy when some relative meets death. The
technical term for this attitude of the materialistic person 15 §masdna-
vairdagya, or detachment in a cemetery or place of cremation. As con-
firmed in Bhagavad-gita, four classes of men receive an understanding
of spiritual life and God —arta (the distressed), Jjynasu (the inquisitive),
artharthi (one who desires material gains) and jiiani (one who is search-
ing for knowledge). Especially when one is very much distressed by ma-
terial conditions, one becomes interested in God. Therefore Kuntidevi
said in her prayers to Krsna that she preferred distress to a happy mood
of life. In the material world, one who is happy forgets Krsna, or God,
but sometimes, if one is actually pious but in distress, he remembers
Krsna. Queen Kuntidevi therefore preferred distress because it is an op-
portunity for remembering Krsna. When Krsna was leaving Kuntidevi
for His own country, Kuntidevi regretfully said that she was better off in
distress because Krsna was always present, whereas now that the Pan-
davas were situated in their kingdom, Krsna was going away. For a devo-
tee, distress is an opportunity to remember the Supreme Personality of
Godhead constantly.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Seventh Canto, Second
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “Hiranyakasipu, King of
the Demons.”

CHAPTER THREE
HiranyakaSipu’s

Plan to Become Immortal
This chapter describes how Hiranyakasipu performed a severe type of
austerity for material benefit, thus causing great distress throughout the
universe. Even Lord Brahma, the chief personality within this universe,
became somewhat disturbed and personally went to see why
HiranyakaSipu was engaged in such a severe austerity.

HiranyakaS$ipu wanted to become immortal. He wanted not to be con-
quered by anyone, not to be attacked by old age and disease, and not to be
harassed by any opponent. Thus he wanted to become the absolute ruler
of the entire universe. With this desire, he entered the valley of Mandara
Mountain and began practicing a severe type of austerity and meditation.
Seeing HiranyakaSipu engaged in this austerity, the demigods returned
to their respective homes, but while Hiranyakasipu was thus engaged, a
kind of fire began blazing from his head, disturbing the entire universe
and its inhabitants, including the birds, beasts and demigods. When all
the higher and lower planets became too hot to live on, the demigods,
being disturbed, left their abodes in the higher planets and went to see
Lord Brahma, praying to him that he curtail this unnecessary heat. The
demigods disclosed to Lord Brahma Hiranyaka$ipu’s ambition to become
immortal, overcoming his short duration of life, and to be the master of
all the planetary systems, even Dhruvaloka.

Upon hearing about the purpose of Hiranyakasipu’s austere medita-
tion, Lord Brahma, accompanied by the great sage Bhrgu and great per-
sonalities like Daksa, went to see HiranyakaSipu. He then sprinkled
water from his kamandalu, a type of waterpot, upon Hiranyakasipu’s
head.

Hiranyaka$ipu, the King of the Daityas, bowed down before Lord
Brahma, the creator of this universe, offering respectful obeisances again
and again and offering prayers. When Lord Brahma agreed to give him
benedictions, he prayed not be killed by any living entity, not to be killed
in any place, covered or uncovered, not to die in the daytime or at night,

129


--- Page 135 ---
130 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 3
not to be killed by any weapon, on land or in the air, and not to be killed
by any human being, animal, demigod or any other entity, living or non-
living. He further prayed for supremacy over the entire universe and re-
quested the eight yogic perfections, such as anima and laghima.

TRANSLATION
Narada Muni said to Maharaja Yudhisthira: The demoniac king
HiranyakaSipu wanted to be unconquerable and free from old age
and dwindling of the body. He wanted to gain all the yogic perfec-
tions like anima and laghima, to be deathless, and to be the only
king of the entire universe, including Brahmaloka.
PURPORT
Such are the goals of the austerities performed by demons.
Hiranyakasipu wanted to receive a benediction from Lord Brahma so that


--- Page 136 ---
Text 3] Hiranyaka$ipu’s Plan to Become Immortal 131
in the future he would be able to conquer Lord Brahma’s abode.
Similarly, another demon received a benediction from Lord Siva but later
wanted to kill Lord Siva through that same benediction. Thus self-
interested persons, by demoniac austerity, want to kill even their
benedictors, whereas the Vaisnava wants to remain an ever-existing ser-
vant of the Lord and never to occupy the post of the Lord. Through sayu-
Jya-mukti, which is generally demanded by asuras, one merges into the
existence of the Lord, but although one sometimes thus achieves the goal
of the theory of monism, one falls down again to struggle in material
existence.

TRANSLATION
“The supreme person within this universe, Lord Brahma, has
gotten his exalted post by dint of severe austerities, mystic power
and trance. Consequently, after creating the universe, he has be-
come the most worshipable demigod within it. Since I am eternal
and time is eternal, I shall endeavor for such austerity, mystic
power and trance for many, many births, and thus I shall eccupy
the same post occupied by Lord Brahma.
PURPORT
Hiranyakasipu’s determination was to occupy the post of Lord
Brahma, but this was impossible because Brahma has a long duration of
life. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (8.17), sahasra-yuga-paryantam
ahar yad brahmano viduh: one thousand yugas equals one day of
Brahma. The duration of Brahma’s life is extremely great, and conse-
quently it was impossible for Hiranyakasipu to occupy that post. None-
theless, his decision was that since the self (atma) and time are both
eternal, if he could not occupy that post in one lifetime he would con-
tinue to execute austerities life after life so that sometime he would be
able to do so.

“By dint of my severe austerities, I shall reverse the results of
pious and impious activities. I shall overturn all the established
practices within this world. Even Dhruvaloka will be vanquished at
the end of the millennium. Therefore, what is the use of it? I shall
prefer to remain in the position of Brahma.”
PURPORT
Hiranyakasipu’s demoniac determination was explained to Lord
Brahma by the demigods, who informed him that Hiranyakasipu wanted
to overturn all the established principles. After executing severe
austerities, people within this material world are promoted to the
heavenly planets, but HiranyakaSipu wanted them to be unhappy,
suffering because of the diplomatic feelings of the demigods, even in the
heavenly planets. He wanted those who were harassed in this world by
material transactions to be unhappy for the same reason, even in the
heavenly planets. Indeed, he wanted to introduce such harassment
everywhere. One might ask how this would be possible, since the univer-
sal order has been established since time immemorial, but Hiranyakasipu


--- Page 143 ---
138 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 3
was proud to declare that he would be able to do everything by the power
of his tapasya. He even wanted to make the Vaisnavas’ position insecure.
These are some of the symptoms of asuric determination.

TRANSLATION
O lord, we have heard from reliable sources that in order to ob-
tain your post, HiranyakaSipu is now engaged in severe austerity.
You are the master of the three worlds. Please, without delay, take
whatever steps you deem appropriate.
PURPORT
In the material world, a servant is provided for by the master but is al-
ways planning how to capture the master’s post. There have been many
instances of this in history. Especially in India during the Mohammedan
rule, many servants, by plans and devices, took over the posts of their
masters. It is learned from Caitanya literature that one big Zamindar,
Subuddhi Raya, kept a Mohammedan boy as a servant. Of course, he
treated the boy as his own child, and sometimes, when the boy would
steal something, the master would chastise him by striking him with a
cane. There was a mark on the boy’s back from this chastisement. Later,


--- Page 144 ---
Text 13] Hiranyaka$ipu’s Plan to Become Immortal 139
after that boy had by crooked means become Hussain Shah, Nawab of
Bengal, one day his wife saw the mark on his back and inquired about it.
The Nawab replied that in his childhood he had been a servant of Subud-
dhi Raya, who had punished him because of some mischievous activities.
Upon hearing this, the Nawab’s wife immediately became agitated and
requested her husband to kill Subuddhi Raya. Nawab Hussain Shah, of
course, was very grateful to Subuddhi Raya and therefore refused to kill
him, but when his wife requested him to turn Subuddhi Raya into a
Mohammedan, the Nawab agreed. Taking some water from his waterpot,
he sprinkled it upon Subuddhi Raya and declared that Subuddhi Raya
had now become a Mohammedan. The point is that this Nawab had been
an ordinary menial servant of Subuddhi Raya but was somehow or other
able to occupy the supreme post of Nawab of Bengal. This is the material
world. Everyone is trying to become master through various devices, al-
though everyone is servant of his senses. Following this system, a living
entity, although servant of his senses, tries to become master of the
whole universe. HiranyakaSipu was a typical example of this, and
Brahma was informed by the demigods of his intentions.

140 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 3
TRANSLATION

O Lord Brahma, your position within this universe is certainly
most auspicious for everyone, especially the cows and brahmanas.
Brahminical culture and the protection of cows can be increasingly
glorified, and thus all kinds of material happiness, opulence and
good fortune will automatically increase. But unfortunately, if
Hiranyakasipu occupies your seat, everything will be lost.

PURPORT

In this verse the words dvija-gavarih paramesthyam indicate the most
exalted position of the brahmanas, brahminical culture and the cows. In
Vedic culture, the welfare of the cows and the welfare of the brahmanas
are essential. Without a proper arrangement for developing brahminical
culture and protecting cows, all the affairs of administration will go to
hell. Being afraid that Hiranyakasipu would occupy the post of Brahma,
all the demigods were extremely disturbed. Hiranyakasipu was a well-
known demon, and the demigods knew that if demons and Raksasas were
to occupy the supreme post, brahminical culture and protection of cows
would come to an end. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (5.29), the original
proprietor of everything is Lord Krsna (bhoktaram yajiia-tapasari
sarva-loka-mahesvaram). The Lord, therefore, knows particularly well
how to develop the material condition of the living entities within this
material world. In every universe there is one Brahma engaged on behalf
of Lord Krsna, as confirmed in Srimad-Bhagavatam (tene brahma hrda
ya adi-kavaye). The principal creator in each brahmanda is Lord
Brahma, who imparts Vedic knowledge to his disciples and sons. On
every planet, the king or supreme controller must be a representative of
Brahma. Therefore, if a Raksasa, or demon, were situated in Brahma’s
post, then the entire arrangement of the universe, especially the protec-
tion of the brahminical culture and cows, would be ruined. All the
demigods anticipated this danger, and therefore they went to request
Lord Brahma to take immediate steps to thwart Hiranyaka$ipu’s plan.

In the beginning of creation, Lord Brahma was attacked by two
demons—Madhu and Kaitabha—but Krsna saved him. Therefore Krsna
is addressed as madhu-kaitabha-hantr. Now again, HiranyakaSipu was
trying to replace Brahma. The material world is so situated that even the


--- Page 146 ---
Text 14] HiranyakasSipu’s Plan to Become Immortal 141
position of Lord Brahma, not to speak of ordinary living entities, is
sometimes in danger. Nonetheless, until the time of Hiranyakasipu, no
one had tried to replace Lord Brahma. Hiranyaka$ipu, however, was such
a great demon that he maintained this ambition.

The word bhityai means “for increasing opulence,” and the word
Sreyase refers to ultimately returning home, back to Godhead. In
spiritual advancement, one’s material position improves at the same time
that the path of liberation becomes clear and one is freed from material
bondage. If one is situated in an opulent position in spiritual advance-
ment, his opulence never decreases. Therefore such a spiritual benedic-
tion is called bhuti or vibhiiti. Krsna confirms this in Bhagavad-gita
(10.41). Yad yad vibhatimat sattvar . . . mama tejo-’msa-sambhavam:
if a devotee advances in spiritual consciousness and thus becomes ma-
terially opulent also, his position is a special gift from the Lord. Such
opulence is never to be considered material. At the present, especially on
this planet earth, the influence of Lord Brahma has decreased considera-
bly, and the representatives of Hiranyakasipu—the Raksasas and
demons—have taken charge. Therefore there is no protection of
brahminical culture and cows, which are the basic prerequisites for all
kinds of good fortune. This age is very dangerous because society is
being managed by demons and Raksasas.

O King, being thus informed by the demigods, the most power-
ful Lord Brahma, accompanied by Bhrgu, Daksa and other great
sages, immediately started for the place where Hiranyakasipu was
performing his penances and austerities.
PURPORT
Lord Brahma was waiting for the austerities performed by
Hiranyakasipu to mature so that he could go there and offer benedictions
according to Hiranyakasipu’s desire. Now, taking the opportunity of
being accompanied by all the demigods and great saintly persons,
Brahma went there to award him the benediction he desired.

TRANSLATION

Lord Brahma, who is carried by a swan airplane, at first could
not see where Hiranyakasipu was, for Hiranyakasipu’s body was
covered by an anthill and by grass and bamboo sticks. Because
Hiranyakasipu had been there for a long time, the ants had
devoured his skin, fat, flesh and blood. Then Lord Brahma and the
demigods spotted him, resembling a cloud-covered sun, heating
all the world by his austerity. Struck with wonder, Lord Brahma
began to smile and then addressed him as follows.

PURPORT

The living entity can live merely by his own power, without the help
of skin, marrow, bone, blood and so on, because it is said, asarigo yar
purusah—the living entity has nothing to do with the material covering.
Hiranyakasipu performed a severe type of tapasya, austerity, for many
long years. Indeed, it is said that he performed the tapasya for one
hundred heavenly years. Since one day of the demigods equals six of our
months, certainly this was a very long time. By nature’s own way, his
body had been almost consumed by earthworms, ants and other parasites,
and therefore even Brahma was at first unable to see him. Later,
however, Brahma could ascertain where Hiranyakasipu was, and Brahma
was struck with wonder to see HiranyakaSipu’s extraordinary power to
execute tapasya. Anyone would conclude that Hiranyakasipu was dead
because his body was covered in so many ways, but Lord Brahma, the
supreme living being in this universe, could understand that
Hiranyakasipu was alive but covered by material elements.

It is also to be noted that although Hiranyakasipu performed this
austerity for a long, long time, he was nonetheless known as a Daitya and
Raksasa. It will be seen from verses to follow that even great saintly per-
sons could not perform such a severe type of austerity. Why then was he


--- Page 149 ---
144 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 3
called a Raksasa and Daitya? It is because whatever he did was for his
own sense gratification. His son Prahlada Maharaja was only five years
old, and so what could Prahlada do? Yet simply by performing a little
devotional service according to the instructions of Narada Muni,
Prahlada became so dear to the Lord that the Lord came to save him,
whereas HiranyakaSipu, in spite of all his austerities, was killed. This is
the difference between devotional service and all other methods of per-
fection. One who performs severe austerities for sense gratification is
fearful to the entire world, whereas a devotee who performs even a slight
amount of devotional service is a friend to everyone (suhrdari sarva-
bhatanam). Since the Lord is the well-wisher of every living entity and
since a devotee assumes the qualities of the Lord, a devotee also acts for
everyone's good fortune by performing devotional service. Thus al-
though Hiranyakasipu performed such a severe austerity, he remained a
Daitya and a Raksasa, whereas Prahlada Maharaja, although born of the
same Daitya father, became the most exalted devotee and was personally
protected by the Supreme Lord. Bhakti is therefore called sarvopadhi-
vinirmuktam, indicating that a devotee is freed from all material desig-
nations, and anyabhildsita-sanyam, situated in a transcendental posi-
tion, free from all material desires.

shall try to fulfill your wish.
PURPORT
Srila Madhvacarya quotes from the Skanda Purana, which says that
Hiranyaka$ipu, having become a devotee of Lord Brahma, who is known
as Hiranyagarbha, and having undergone a severe austerity to please
him, is also known as Hiranyaka. Raksasas and demons worship various
demigods, such as Lord Brahma and Lord Siva, just to take the post of
these demigods. This we have already explained in previous verses.

I have been very much astonished to see your endurance. In

are keeping your life air circulating within your bones. Certainly
this is wonderful.
PURPORT

It appears that the soul can exist even through the bones, as shown by
the personal example of Hiranyakasipu. When great yogis are in
samadhi, even when their bodies are buried and their skin, marrow,
blood and so on have all been eaten, if only their bones remain they can
exist in a transcendental position. Very recently an archaeologist
published findings indicating that Lord Christ, after being buried, was
exhumed and that he then went to Kashmir. There have been many ac-
tual examples of yogis’ being buried in trance and exhumed alive and in
good condition several hours later. A yogi can keep himself alive in a
transcendental state even if buried not only for many days but for many
years.

eaten by ants and moths.

In regard to the word jitah, Srila Madhva Muni gives the following
quotation from the Sabda-nirmaya: parabhitari vasa-sthari ca jitabhid
ucyate budhaih. “If one comes under someone else’s control or is de-
feated by another, he is called jitah.”” Hiranyakasipu’s austerity was so
great and wonderful that even Lord Brahma agreed to be conquered by
him.

me will not go in vain.
PURPORT
It appears that human beings and asuras are subject to death, whereas
demigods are not. The demigods who reside with Lord Brahma in
Satyaloka go to Vaikunthaloka in their present bodily constructions at
the time of the dissolution. Therefore although Hiranyakasipu had un-
dergone severe austerities, Lord Brahma predicted that he had to die; he
could not become immortal or even gain equal status with the demigods.
The great austerities and penances he had performed for so many years
could not give him protection from death. This was foretold by Lord
Brahma.

Sri Narada Muni continued: After speaking these words to
Hiranyakasipu, Lord Brahma, the original being of this universe,
who is extremely powerful, sprinkled transcendental, infallible,
spiritual water from his kamandalu upon Hiranyakasipu’s body,
which had been eaten away by ants and moths. Thus he enlivened
Hiranyakasipu.
PURPORT
Lord Brahma is the first created being within this universe and is em-
powered by the Supreme Lord to create. Tene brahma hrda ya adi-
kavaye: the adi-deva, or adi-kavi—the first living creature—was per-
sonally taught by the Supreme Personality of Godhead through the heart.
There was no one to teach him, but since the Lord is situated within
Brahma’s heart, Brahma was educated by the Lord Himself. Lord
Brahma, being especially empowered, is infallible in doing whatever he
wants. This is the meaning of the word amogha-radhasa. He desired to
restore Hiranyakasipu’s original body, and therefore, by sprinkling tran-
scendental water from his waterpot, he immediately did so.

As soon as he was sprinkled with the water from Lord Brahma’s
waterpot, HiranyakaSipu arose, endowed with a full body with
limbs so strong that they could bear the striking of a thunderbolt.
With physical strength and a bodily luster resembling molten
gold, he emerged from the anthill a completely young man, just as
fire springs from fuel wood.
PURPORT
Hiranyakasipu was revitalized, so much so that his body was quite
competent to tolerate the striking of thunderbolts. He was now a young
man with a strong body and a very beautiful bodily luster resembling
molten gold. This is the rejuvenation that took place because of his
severe austerity and penance.

Seeing Lord Brahma present before him in the sky, carried by

PURPORT
Lord Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (9.23-24);
ye ’py anya-devata-bhakta

“Whatever a man may sacrifice to other gods, O son of Kunti, is really
meant for Me alone, but it is offered without true understanding. I am
the only enjoyer and the only object of sacrifice. Those who do not recog-
nize My true transcendental nature fall down.”
In effect, Krsna says, “Persons engaged in the worship of demigods
are not very intelligent, although such worship is indirectly offered to


--- Page 157 ---
152 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 3
Me.” For example, when a man pours water on the leaves and branches
of a tree without pouring water on the root, he does so without sufficient
knowledge or without observing regulative principles. The process of
watering a tree is to pour water on the root. Similarly, the process of ren-
dering service to different parts of the body is to supply food to the
stomach. The demigods are, so to speak, different officers and directors
in the government of the Supreme Lord. One has to follow the laws made
by the government, not by the officers or directors. Similarly, everyone is
to offer his worship to the Supreme Lord only. That will automatically
satisfy the different officers and directors of the Lord. The officers and
directors are engaged as representatives of the government, and to offer
some bribe to the officers and directors is illegal. This is stated in
Bhagavad-gita as avidhi-piarvakam. In other words, Krsna does not ap-
prove the unnecessary worship of the demigods.

In Bhagavad-gita it is clearly stated that there are many types of yajiia
performances recommended in the Vedic literatures, but actually all of
them are meant for satisfying the Supreme Lord. Yajfia means Visnu. In
the Third Chapter of Bhagavad-gita it is clearly stated that one should
work only for satisfying Yajiia, or Visnu. The perfectional form of
human civilization, known as varnasrama-dharma, is specifically meant
for satisfying Visnu. Therefore, Krsna says, “I am the enjoyer of all
sacrifices because I am the supreme master.” However, less intelligent
persons, without knowing this fact, worship demigods for temporary
benefit. Therefore they fall down to material existence and do not
achieve the desired goal of life. If, however, anyone has any material
desire to be fulfilled, he had better pray for it to the Supreme Lord
(although that is not pure devotion), and he will thus achieve the desired
result.

Although Hiranyaka$ipu offered his obeisances unto Lord Brahma, he
was strongly inimical toward Lord Vispu. This is the symptom of an
asura. Asuras worship the demigods as being separate from the Lord, not
knowing that all the demigods are powerful because of being servants of
the Lord. If the Supreme Lord were to withdraw the powers of the
demigods, the demigods would no longer be able to offer benedictions to
their worshipers. The difference between a devotee and a nondevotee, or
asura, is that a devotee knows that Lord Visnu is the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead and that everyone derives power from Him. Without


--- Page 158 ---
Text 25] HiranyakaSipu’s Plan to Become Immortal 153
worshiping the demigods for particular powers, a devotee worships Lord
Visnu, knowing that if he desires a particular power he can get that
power while acting as Lord Visnu’s devotee. Therefore in the sastra
(Bhag. 2.3.10) it is recommended:
akamah sarva-kamo va
moksa-kama udara-dhih
tivrena bhakti-yogena
yajeta purusam param
‘A person who has broader intelligence, whether he be full of material
desires, free from material desires, or desiring liberation, must by all
means worship the supreme whole, the Personality of Godhead.” Even if
a person has material desires, instead of worshiping the demigods he
should pray to the Supreme Lord so that his connection with the Supreme
Lord will be established and he will be saved from becoming a demon or
a nondevotee. In this regard, Srila Madhviacarya gives the following
quotation from the Brahma-tarka:
eka-sthanaika-karyatvad
visnoh pradhanyatas tatha
Jivasya tad-adhinatvan
na bhinnadhikrtari vacah
Since Visnu is the Supreme, by worshiping Visnu one can fulfill all one’s
desires. There is no need to divert one’s attention to any demigod.

TRANSLATION

Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto the supreme lord
within this universe. At the end of each day of his life, the uni-
verse is fully covered with dense darkness by the influence of
time, and then again, during his next day, that self-effulgent lord,
by his own effulgence, manifests, maintains and destroys the en-
tire cosmic manifestation through the material energy, which is
invested with the three modes of material nature. He, Lord
Brahma, is the shelter of those modes of nature —sattva-guna,
rajo-guna and tamo-guna.

PURPORT

The words abhivyanag jagad idam refer to he who creates this cosmic
manifestation. The original creator is the Supreme Personality of God-
head, Krsna (janmady asya yatah); Lord Brahma is the secondary cre-
ator. When Lord Brahma is empowered by Lord Krsna as the engineer to
create the phenomenal world, he becomes the supremely powerful
feature within this universe. The total material energy is created by
Krsna, and later, taking advantage of all that has necessarily been cre-
ated, Lord Brahma engineers the entire phenomenal universe. At the end
of Lord Brahma’s day, everything up to Svargaloka is inundated with
water, and the next morning, when there is darkness in the universe,
Brahma again brings the phenomenal manifestation into existence.
Therefore he is described here as he who manifests this universe.

Trin gunan vrnoti: Lord Brahma takes advantage of the three modes
of material nature. Prakrti, material nature, is described here as tri-vrta,
the source of the three material modes. Srila Madhvacarya comments in


--- Page 161 ---
156 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 3
this connection that tri-vrta means prakrtya. Thus Lord Krsna is the
original creator, and Lord Brahma is the original engineer.

TRANSLATION

I offer my obeisances to the original personality within this uni-
verse, Lord Brahma, who is cognizant and who can apply his mind
and realized intelligence in creating this cosmic manifestation. It is
because of his activities that everything within the universe is visi-
ble. He is therefore the cause of all manifestations.

PURPORT

The Vedanta-siitra begins by declaring that the Absolute Person is the
original source of all creation (janmady asya yatah). One may ask
whether Lord Brahma is the Supreme Absolute Person. No, the Supreme
Absolute Person is Krsna. Brahma receives his mind, intelligence, ma-
terials and everything else from Krsna, and then he becomes the second-
ary creator, the engineer of this universe. In this regard we may note
that the creation does not take place accidentally, because of the explo-
sion of a chunk. Such nonsensical theories are not accepted by Vedic stu-
dents. The first created living being is Brahma, who is endowed with


--- Page 162 ---
Text 29] Hiranyakasipu’s Plan to Become Immortal 157
perfect knowledge and intelligence by the Lord. As stated in Srimad-
Bhagavatam, tene brahma hrda ya adi-kavaye: although Brahma is the
first created being, he is not independent, for he receives help from the
Supreme Personality of Godhead through his heart. There is no one but
Brahma at the time of creation, and therefore he receives his intelligence
directly from the Lord through the heart. This has been discussed in the
beginning of Srimad-Bhagavatam.

Lord Brahma is described in this verse as the original cause of the cos-
mic manifestation, and this applies to his position in the material world.
There are many, many such controllers, all of whom are created by the
Supreme Lord, Visnu. This is illustrated by an incident described in
Caitanya-caritamrta. When the Brahma of this particular universe was
invited by Krsna to Dvaraka, he thought that he was the only Brahma.
Therefore when Krsna inquired from His servant which Brahma was at
the door to visit, Lord Brahma was surprised. He replied that of course
Lord Brahma, the father of the four Kumaras, was waiting at the door.
Later, Lord Brahma asked Krsna why He had inquired which Brahma
had come. He was then informed that there are millions of other
Brahmas because there are millions of universes. Krsna then called all
the Brahmas, who immediately came to visit Him. The catur-mukha
Brahma, the four-headed Brahma of this universe, thought himself a
very insignificant creature in the presence of so many Brahmas with so
many heads. Thus although there is a Brahma who is the engineer of
each universe, Krsna is the original source of all of them.

of the two kinds of senses (acting and knowledge-gathering); patih—the

TRANSLATION

Your Lordship, being the origin of the life of this material
world, is the master and controller of the living entities, both mov-
ing and stationary, and you inspire their consciousness. You main-
tain the mind and the acting and knowledge-acquiring senses, and
therefore you are the great controller of all the material elements
and their qualities, and you are the controller of all desires.

PURPORT

In this verse it is clearly indicated that the original source of every-
thing is life. Brahma was instructed by the supreme life, Krsna. Krsna is
the supreme living entity (nityo nityanam cetanas cetananam), and
Brahma is also a living entity, but the original source of Brahma is
Krsna. Therefore Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (7.7), mattah parataram
nanyat kinicid asti dhananjaya: “O Arjuna, there is no truth superior to
Me.”” Krsna is the original source of Brahma, who is the original source
of this universe. Brahma is a representative of Krsna, and therefore all
the qualities and activities of Krsna are also present in Lord Brahma.

TRANSLATION
My dear lord, by your form as the Vedas personified and
through knowledge relating to the activities of all the yajiic
brahmanas, you spread the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies of the
seven kinds of sacrifices, headed by agnistoma. Indeed, you inspire
the yajiiic brahmanas to perform the rituals mentioned in the
three Vedas. Being the Supreme Soul, the Supersoul of all living
entities, you are beginningless, endless and omniscient, beyond
the limits of time and space.
PURPORT
The Vedic ritualistic ceremonies, the knowledge thereof, and the per-
son who agrees to perform them are inspired by the Supreme Soul. As
confirmed in Bhagavad-gita, mattah smrtir jignam apohanam ca: from
the Lord come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness. The Super-
soul is situated in everyones heart (sarvasya cahari hrdi sannivistah,
isvarah sarva-bhitanam hrd-dese ’rjuna tisthati), and when one is ad-
vanced in Vedic knowledge, the Supersoul gives him directions. Acting
as Supersoul, the Lord gives inspiration to a suitable person to perform
the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies. In this connection, four classes of
priests, known as rtvik, are required. They are mentioned as hota,
adhvaryu, brahma and udgata.

O my lord, Your Lordship is eternally awake, seeing everything
that happens. As eternal time, you reduce the duration of life for
all living entities through your different parts, such as moments,
seconds, minutes and hours. Nonetheless, you are unchanged,
resting in one place as the Supersoul, witness and Supreme Lord,
the birthless, all-pervading controller who is the cause of life for
all living entities.
PURPORT
In this verse the word kata-stha is very important. Although the
Supreme Personality of Godhead is situated everywhere, He is the
central unchanging point. [svarah sarva-bhatanar hrd-dese ’'rjuna
tisthati: the Lord is situated in full in the core of everyone's heart. As in-
dicated in the Upanisads by the word ekatvam, although there are


--- Page 166 ---
Text 32] Hiranyaka$ipu’s Plan to Become Immortal 161
millions and millions of living entities, the Lord is situated as the Super-
soul in every one of them. Nonetheless, He is one in many. As stated in
the Brahma-sarhita, advaitam acyutam anadim ananta-riipam: He has
many forms, yet they are advaita—one and unchanging. Since the Lord
is all-pervading, He is also situated in eternal time. The living entities
are described as parts and parcels of the Lord because He is the life and
soul of all living entities, being situated within their hearts as the an-
taryami, as enunciated by the philosophy of inconceivable oneness and
difference (acintya-bhedabheda). Since the living entities are part of
God, they are one in quality with the Lord, yet they are different from
Him. The Supersoul, who inspires all living entities to act, is one and
changeless. There are varieties of subjects, objects and activities, yet the
Lord is one.

There is nothing separate from you, whether it be better or

--- Page 167 ---
162 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 3
Vedic literatures like the Upanisads, and from all the sub-limbs of
the original Vedic knowledge, form your external body. You are
Hiranyagarbha, the reservoir of the universe, but nonetheless,
being situated as the supreme controller, you are transcendental to
the material world, which consists of the three modes of material
nature.
PURPORT
The word param means “the supreme cause,” and aparam means
“the effect.” The supreme cause is the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
and the effect is material nature. The living entities, both moving and
nonmoving, are controlled by the Vedic instructions in art and science,
and therefore they are all expansions of the external energy of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the center as the Supersoul. The
brahmandos, the universes, exist during the duration of a breath of the
Supreme Lord (yasyaika-nisvasita-kalam athavalambya jivanti loma-
vilaja jagad-anda-nathah). Thus they are also within the womb of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Maha-Visnu. Nothing, therefore, is
separate from the Supreme Lord. This is the philosophy of acintya-
bhedabheda-tattva.

TRANSLATION

O my lord, being changelessly situated in your own abode, you
expand your universal form within this cosmic manifestation, thus
appearing to taste the material world. You are Brahman, the Super-
soul, the oldest, the Personality of Godhead.

PURPORT

It is said that the Absolute Truth appears in three features—namely,
impersonal Brahman, localized Supersoul and ultimately the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Krsna. The cosmic manifestation is the gross
material body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who enjoys the
taste of the material mellows by expanding His parts and parcels, the liv-
ing entities, who are qualitatively one with Him. The Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead, however, is situated in the Vaikuntha planets,
where He enjoys the spiritual mellows. Therefore the one Absolute
Truth, Bhagavan, pervades all by His material cosmic manifestation, the
spiritual Brahman effulgence, and His personal existence as the Supreme
Lord.

Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto the Supreme, who in
his unlimited, unmanifested form has expanded the cosmic
manifestation, the form of the totality of the universe. He
possesses external and internal energies and the mixed energy
called the marginal potency, which consists of all the living
entities.

PURPORT

The Lord is endowed with unlimited potencies (parasya saktir
vividhaiva srayate), which are summarized as three, namely external,
internal and marginal. The external potency manifests this material
world, the internal potency manifests the spiritual world, and the
marginal potency manifests the living entities, who are mixtures of in-
ternal and external. The living entity, being part and parcel of Parabrah-
man, is actually internal potency, but because of being in contact with
the material energy, he is an emanation of material and spiritual en-
ergies. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is above the material energy
and is engaged in spiritual pastimes. The material energy is only an ex-
ternal manifestation of His pastimes.

TRANSLATION

O my lord, O best of the givers of benediction, if you will kindly
grant me the benediction I desire, please let me not meet death
from any of the living entities created by you.

PURPORT

After being created from the navel of Garbhodaka$ayi Visnu, Lord
Brahma, the original created living being within the universe, created
many other different types of living entities to reside in this universe.
Therefore, from the beginning of creation, the living entities were born
of a superior living entity. Ultimately, Krsna is the supreme living being,
the father of all others. Akar bija-pradah pita: He is the seed-giving
father of all living entities.

Thus far, HiranyakaSipu has adored Lord Brahma as the Supreme
Personality of Godhead and has expected to become immortal by the
benediction of Lord Brahma. Now, however, having come to understand
that even Lord Brahma is not immortal because at the end of the millen-
nium Lord Brahma will also die, Hiranyakasipu is very carefully asking
him for benedictions that will be almost as good as immortality. His first
proposal is that he not be killed by any of the different forms of living
entities created by Lord Brahma within this material world.

Grant me that I not die within any residence or outside any resi-
dence, during the daytime or at night, nor on the ground or in the
sky. Grant me that my death not be brought by any being other
than those created by you, nor by any weapon, nor by any human
being or animal.
PURPORT
Hiranyakasipu was very much afraid of Visnu’s becoming an animal
to kill him because his brother had been killed by Visnu when the Lord
took the shape of a boar. He was therefore very careful to guard against
all kinds of animals. But even without taking the shape of an animal,
Visnu could kill him by hurling His Sudarsana cakra, which can go any-
where without the Lord’s physical presence. Therefore Hiranyakasipu
was careful to guard against all kinds of weapons. He guarded against all
kinds of time, space and countries because he was afraid of being killed
by someone else in another land. There are many other planets, higher
and lower, and therefore he prayed for the benediction of not being
killed by any resident of any of these planets. There are three original
deities—Brahma, Visnu and Mahesvara. HiranyakaSipu knew that
Brahma would not kill him, but he also wanted not to be killed by Lord
Visnu or Lord Siva. Consequently, he prayed for such a benediction.
Thus Hiranyakasipu thought himself securely protected from any kind
of death caused by any living entity within this universe. He also
carefully guarded against natural death, which might take place within
his house or outside of the house.

Grant me that I not meet death from any entity, living or nonliv-
ing. Grant me, further, that I not be killed by any demigod or
demon or by any great snake from the lower planets. Since no one
can kill you in the battlefield, you have no competitor. Therefore,
grant me the benediction that I too may have no rival. Give me sole
lordship over all the living entities and presiding deities, and give
me all the glories obtained by that position. Furthermore, give me
all the mystic powers attained by long austerities and the practice
of yoga, for these cannot be lost at any time.
PURPORT
Lord Brahmi obtained his supreme position due to long austerities and
penances, mystic yoga, meditation and so on. HiranyakaSipu wanted a
similar position. The ordinary powers achieved by mystic yoga,


--- Page 173 ---
168 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 3
austerities and other processes are sometimes vanquished, but the
powers obtained by the mercy of the Lord are never vanquished.
Hiranyakasipu, therefore, wanted a benediction that would never be
vanquished.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Seventh Canto. Third
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “Hiranyakasipu’s Plan to
Become Immortal.”


--- Page 174 ---
CHAPTER FOUR
Hiranyakasipu Terrorizes the Universe
This chapter fully describes how HiranyakaSipu obtained power from
Lord Brahma and misused it by harassing all the living entities within
this universe.

By severe austerities, HiranyakaSipu satisfied Lord Brahma and ob-
tained the benedictions he desired. After he received these benedictions,
his body, which had been almost entirely consumed, was revived with
full beauty and a luster like gold. Nonetheless, he continued to be en-
vious of Lord Visnu, unable to forget Lord Visnu’s having killed his
brother. HiranyakaSipu conquered everyone in the ten directions and the
three worlds and brought all living entities, both demigods and asuras,
under his control. Becoming the master of all places, including the resi-
dence of Indra, whom he had driven out, he began enjoying life in great
luxury and thus became mad. All the demigods but Lord Visnu, Lord
Brahma and Lord Siva came under his control and began serving him,
but despite all his material power he was dissatisfied because he was al-
ways puffed up, proud of transgressing the Vedic regulations. All the
brahmanas were dissatisfied with him, and they cursed him with deter-
mination. Eventually, all the living entities within the universe, repre-
sented by the demigods and sages, prayed to the Supreme Lord for relief
from Hiranyakasipu’s rule.

Lord Visnu informed the demigods that they and the other living en-
tities would be saved from the fearful conditions created by
Hiranyaka$ipu. Since Hiranyakasipu was the oppressor of all the
demigods, the followers of the Vedas, the cows, the brahmanas and the
religious, saintly persons, and since he was envious of the Supreme Lord,
he would naturally be killed very soon. Hiranyaka$ipu’s last exploit
would be to torment his own son Prahlada, who was a maha-bhagavata,
an exalted Vaisnava. Then his life would end. When the demigods were
thus reassured by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, everyone was
satisfied, knowing that the miseries inflicted upon them by
Hiranyakasipu would come to an end.

Finally, Narada Muni describes the characteristics of Prahlada
Maharaja, the son of Hiranyakasipu, and describes how his father envied
his own qualified son. In this way the chapter ends.

TRANSLATION
Lord Brahma said: O HiranyakaSipu, these benedictions for
which you have asked are difficult to obtain for most men. None-
theless, O my son, I shall grant you them although they are
generally not available.
PURPORT
Material benedictions are not always exactly worthy of being called
benedictions. If one possesses more and more, a benediction itself may
become a curse, for just as achieving material opulence in this material
world requires great strength and endeavor, maintaining it also requires
great endeavor. Lord Brahma informed Hiranyakasipu that although he
was ready to offer him whatever he had asked, the result of the benedic-
tions would be very difficult for Hiranyakasipu to maintain. Nonetheless,
since Brahma had promised, he wanted to grant all the benedictions
asked. The word durlabhan indicates that one should not take benedic-
tions one cannot enjoy peacefully.

TRANSLATION

Hiranyakasipu became the conqueror of the entire universe. In-
deed, that great demon conquered all the planets in the three
worlds —upper, middle and lower —including the planets of the
human beings, the Gandharvas, the Garudas, the great serpents,
the Siddhas, Caranas and Vidyadharas, the great saints, Yamaraja,
the Manus, the Yaksas, the Raksasas, the Pisacas and their masters,
and the masters of the ghosts and Bhiitas. He defeated the rulers of
all the other planets where there are living entities and brought
them under his control. Conquering the abodes of all, he seized
their power and influence.

PURPORT

The word garuda in this verse indicates that there are planets of great
birds like Garuda. Similarly, the word uraga indicates that there are
planets of enormous serpents. Such a description of the various planets
of the universe may challenge modern scientists who think that all
planets but this earth are vacant. These scientists claim to have launched
excursions to the moon, where they have found no living entities but
only big craters full of dust and stone, although in fact the moon is so
brilliant that it acts like the sun in illuminating the entire universe. Of
course, it is not possible to convince modern scientists of the Vedic infor-
mation about the universe. Nonetheless, we are not very much impressed

Text 8] Hiranyakasipu Terrorizes the Universe 175
by the words of scientists who say that all other planets are vacant and
that only the earth is full of living entities.

TRANSLATION
HiranyakasSipu, who possessed all opulence, began residing in
heaven, with its famous Nandana garden, which is enjoyed by the
demigods. In fact, he resided in the most opulent palace of Indra,
the King of heaven. The palace had been directly constructed by
the demigod architect Visvakarma and was as beautifully made as if
the goddess of fortune of the entire universe resided there.
PURPORT
From this description it appears that all the heavenly planets of the
upper planetary system are thousands upon thousands of times more


--- Page 181 ---
176 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 4
opulent than the lower planetary system in which we live. Visvakarma,
the famous heavenly architect, is known as the constructor of many won-
derful buildings in the upper planets, where there are not only beautiful
buildings, but also many opulent gardens and parks, which are described
as nandana-devodyana, gardens quite fit to be enjoyed by the demigods.
This description of the upper planetary system and its opulences is to be
understood from authoritative scriptures like the Vedic literatures.
Telescopes and the other imperfect instruments of scientists are inade-
quate for evaluating the upper planetary system. Although such
instruments are needed because the vision of the so-called scientists is
imperfect, the instruments themselves are also imperfect. Therefore the
upper planets cannot be appraised by imperfect men using imperfect
man-made instruments. Direct information received from the Vedic
literature, however, is perfect, We therefore cannot accept the statement
that there are no opulent residences on planets other than this earth.

crystal, and the columns of vaidirya stone. The wonderful
canopies were beautifully decorated, the seats were bedecked with
rubies, and the silk bedding, as white as foam, was decorated with
pearls. The ladies of the palace, who were blessed with beautiful
teeth and the most wonderfully beautiful faces, walked here and
there in the palace, their ankle bells tinkling melodiously, and saw
their own beautiful reflections in the gems. The demigods,
however, being very much oppressed, had to bow down and offer
obeisances at the feet of HiranyakaSipu, who chastised the
demigods very severely and for no reason. Thus Hiranyakasipu
lived in the palace and severely ruled everyone.
PURPORT

Hiranyakasipu was so powerful in the heavenly planets that all the
demigods except Lord Brahma, Lord Siva and Lord Visnu were forced to
engage in his service. Indeed, they were afraid of being severely
punished if they disobeyed him. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti has com-
pared Hiranyakasipu to Maharaja Vena, who was also atheistic and
scornful of the ritualistic ceremonies mentioned in the Vedas. Yet
Maharaja Vena was afraid of some of the great sages such as Bhrgu,
whereas Hiranyakasipu ruled in such a way that everyone feared him but
Lord Vispu, Lord Brahma and Lord Siva. Hiranyakasipu was so alert
against being burnt to ashes by the anger of great sages like Bhrgu that
by dint of austerity he surpassed their power and placed even them
under his subordination. It appears that even in the higher planetary
systems, to which people are promoted by pious activities, disturbances
are created by asuras like Hiranyakasipu. No one in the three worlds can
live in peace and prosperity without disturbance.

O my dear King, HiranyakaSipu was always drunk on strong-
smelling wines and liquors, and therefore his coppery eyes were
always rolling. Nonetheless, because he had powerfully executed
great austerities in mystic yoga, although he was abominable, all
but the three principal demigods—Lord Brahma, Lord Siva and
Lord Visnu—personally worshiped him to please him by bringing
him various presentations with their own hands.
PURPORT
In the Skanda Purana there is this description: upayanarn daduh
sarve vind devan hiranyakah. HiranyakaSipu was so powerful that
everyone but the three principal demigods —namely Lord Brahma, Lord
Siva and Lord Visnu—engaged in his service. Madhviacarya says, aditya
vasavo rudras tri-vidha hi sura yatah. There are three kinds of
demigods —the Adityas, the Vasus and the Rudras—beneath whom are
the other demigods, like the Maruts and Sadhyas (marutas caiva visve ca
sadhyas caiva ca tad-gatah). Therefore all the demigods are called tri-
pistapa, and the same word tri applies to Lord Brahma, Lord Siva and
Lord Visnu.

Vidyadharas, Apsaras and sages all offered prayers to him again
and again just to glorify him.
PURPORT
The asuras sometimes become so powerful that they can engage even
Narada Muni and similar devotees in their service. This does not mean
that Narada was subordinate to Hiranyakasipu. Sometimes, however, it
so happens in this material world that great personalities, even great de-
votees, can also be controlled by the asuras.

grains, the cows supplied abundant milk, and outer space was
beautifully decorated with wonderful phenomena.

sugarcane juice, wine, clarified butter, milk, yogurt, and sweet
water.

Text 18] Hiranyaka$ipu Terrorizes the Universe 183
PURPORT
The water of the seas and oceans of this planet, of which we have ex-
perience, are salty, but other planets within the universe contain oceans
of sugarcane juice, liquor, ghee, milk and sweet water. The rivers are
figuratively described as wives of the oceans and seas because they glide
down to the oceans and seas as tributaries, like the wives attached to their
husbands. Modern scientists attempt excursions to other planets, but
they have no information of how many different types of oceans and seas
there are within the universe. According to their experience, the moon is
full of dust, but this does not explain how it gives us soothing rays from a
distance of millions of miles. As far as we are concerned, we follow the
authority of Vyasadeva and Sukadeva Gosvami, who have described the
universal situation according to the Vedic literature. These authorities
differ from modern scientists who conclude from their imperfect sensual
experience that only this planet is inhabited by living beings whereas the
other planets are all vacant or full of dust.

yatha vinimayah: this material world is conducted by fire, water and
earth, which combine and take shape. Here it is mentioned that the three
modes of nature (prthag gunan) act under the direction of different
demigods. For example, King Indra is in charge of pouring water, the
demigod Vayu controls the air and dries up the water, whereas the
demigod controlling fire burns everything. Hiranyaka$ipu, however, by
dint of his austere performance of mystic yoga, became so powerful that
he alone took charge of everything, without assistance from the
demigods.

possible, HiranyakaSipu was dissatisfied because instead of con-
trolling his senses he remained their servant.
PURPORT

This is an example of asuric life. Atheists can advance materially and
create an extremely comfortable situation for the senses, but because
they are controlled by the senses, they cannot be satisfied. This is the
effect of modern civilization. Materialists are very much advanced in en-
joying money and women, yet dissatisfaction prevails within human
society because human society cannot be happy and peaceful without
Krsna consciousness. As far as material sense gratification is concerned,
materialists may go on increasing their enjoyment as far as they can
imagine, but because people in such a material condition are servants of
their senses, they cannot be satisfied. Hiranyakaipu was a vivid example
of this dissatisfied state of humanity.

HiranyakaSipu thus passed a long time being very much proud

tioned in the authoritative 5251795. He was therefore subjected to a
curse by the four Kumaras, who were great brahmanas.

186 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 4
PURPORT
There have been many instances in which demons, after achieving
material opulences, have become extremely proud, so much so that they
have transgressed the laws and regulations given in the authoritative
Sastras. Hiranyakasipu acted in this way. As stated in Bhagavad-gita
(16.23):
yah sastra-vidhim utsrjya
. vartate kama-karatah
na sa siddhim avdapnoti
na 5८100072 na param gatim
“He who discards scriptural injunctions and acts according to his own
whims attains neither perfection, nor happiness, nor the supreme
destination.” The word astra refers to that which controls our activities.
We cannot violate or transgress the laws and regulative principles men-
tioned in the $astras. Bhagavad-gita repeatedly confirms this.
tasmdc chastrarn pramanari te
karyakarya-vyavasthitau
JAatva sastra-vidhanoktarm
karma kartum iharhasi
‘One should understand what is duty and what is not duty by the regula-
tions of the scriptures. Knowing such rules and regulations, one should
act so that he may gradually be elevated.” (Bg. 16.24) One should act
according to the direction of the $astra, but the material energy is so
powerful that as soon as one becomes materially opulent, he begins to
transgress the §astric laws. As soon as one transgresses the laws of sastra,
he immediately enters upon the path of destruction.

Everyone, including the rulers of the various planets, was ex-

upon them by Hiranyakasipu. Fearful and disturbed, unable to
find any other shelter, they at last surrendered to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Visnu.
PURPORT
Lord Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (5.29):
bhoktararir yajiia-tapasari
sarva-loka-mahesvaram

“The sages, knowing Me as the ultimate purpose of all sacrifices and
austerities, the Supreme Lord of all planets and demigods and the
benefactor and well-wisher of all living entities, attain peace from the
pangs of material miseries.” The Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Krsna, is actually the best friend of everyone. In a condition of distress
or misery, one wants to seek shelter of a well-wishing friend. The well-
wishing friend of the perfect order is Lord Sri Krsna. Therefore all the
inhabitants of the various planets, being unable to find any other shelter,
were obliged to seek shelter at the lotus feet of the supreme friend. If
from the very beginning we seek shelter of the supreme friend, there


--- Page 193 ---

will be no cause of danger. It is said that if a dog is swimming in the
water and one wants to cross the ocean by catching hold of the dog’s tail,
certainly he is foolish. Similarly, if in distress one seeks shelter of a
demigod, he is foolish, for his efforts will be fruitless. In all circum-
stances, one should seek shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Then there will be no danger under any circumstances.

Text 24] HiranyakaSipu Terrorizes the Universe 189
TRANSLATION

“Let us offer our respectful obeisances unto that direction
where the Supreme Personality of Godhead is situated, where
those purified souls in the renounced order of life, the great
saintly persons, go, and from which, having gone, they never
return.” Without sleep, fully controlling their minds, and living
on only their breath, the predominating deities of the various
planets began worshiping Hrsikesa with this meditation.

PURPORT

The two words tasyai kasthayai are very significant. Everywhere, in
every direction, in every heart and in every atom, the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead is situated in His features as Brahman and
Paramatma. Then what is the purpose of saying tasyai kasthayai—‘‘in
that direction where Hari is situated”? During Hiranyakasipu’s time, his
influence was everywhere, but he could not force his influence into the
places where the Supreme Personality of Godhead had His pastimes. For
example, on this earth there are such places as Vrndavana and Ayodhya,
which are called dhamas. In the dhama, there is no influence from Kali-
yuga or any demon. If one takes shelter of such a dhama, worship of the
Lord becomes very easy, and resultant spiritual advancement quickly
takes place. In fact, in India one may still go to Vrndavana and similar
places to achieve the results of spiritual activities quickly.

TRANSLATION

The voice of the Lord vibrated as follows: O best of learned per-
sons, do not fear! I wish all good fortune to you. Become My devo-
tees by hearing and chanting about Me and offering Me prayers,
for these are certainly meant to award benedictions to all living en-
tities. I know all about the activities of HiranyakaSipu and shall
surely stop them very soon. Please wait patiently until that time.

PURPORT

Sometimes people are very much eager to see God. In considering the
word mad-darsanam, “‘seeing Me,” which is mentioned in this verse,
one should note that in Bhagavad-gita the Lord says, bhaktya mam abhi-
janati. In other words, the ability to understand the Supreme Personality
of Godhead or to see Him or talk with Him depends on one’s advance-
ment in devotional service, which is called bhakti. In bhakti there are
nine different activities: $ravanari kirtanarh visnoh smaranarn pada-
sevanam/ arcanarh vandanarh 025) 277 sakhyam atma-nivedanam. Be-
cause all these devotional activities are absolute, there is no fundamental
difference between worshiping the Deity in the temple, seeing Him and
chanting His glories. Indeed, all of these are ways of seeing Him, for
everything done in devotional service is a means of direct contact with
the Lord. The vibration of the Lord’s voice appeared in the presence of
all the devotees, and although the person vibrating the sound was unseen
to them, they were meeting or seeing the Lord because they were offer-
ing prayers and because the vibration of the Lord was present. Contrary
to the laws of the material world, there is no difference between seeing
the Lord, offering prayers and hearing the transcendental vibration.
Pure devotees, therefore, are fully satisfied by glorifying the Lord. Such
glorification is called kirtana. Performing kirtana and hearing the vibra-
tion of the sound Hare Krsna is actually seeing the Supreme Personality
of Godhead directly. One must realize this position, and then one will be
able to understand the absolute nature of the Lord’s activities.

TRANSLATION

When Hiranyakasipu teases the great devotee Prahlada, his own
son, who is peaceful and sober and who has no enemy, I shall kill
Hiranyakasipu immediately, despite the benedictions of Brahma.

PURPORT
Of all sinful activities, an offense to a pure devotee, or Vaisnava, is the
most severe. An offense at the lotus feet of a Vaisnava is so disastrous
that Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has compared it to a mad elephant that en-
ters a garden and causes great havoc by uprooting many plants and trees.
If one is an offender at the lotus feet of a brahmana or Vaisnava, his
offenses uproot all his auspicious activities. One should therefore very
carefully guard against committing vaisnava-aparadha, or offenses at
the lotus feet of a Vaisnava. Here the Lord clearly says that although
HiranyakaSipu had received benedictions from Lord Brahma, these
benedictions would be null and void as soon as he committed an offense
at the lotus feet of Prahlada Maharaja, his own son. A Vaisnava like
Prahlada Maharaja is described herein as nirvaira, having no enemies.
Elsewhere in Srimad-Bhagavatam (3.25.21) it is said, ajata-Satravah
santah sadhavah sadhu-bhisanah: a devotee has no enemies, he is
peaceful, he abides by the scriptures, and all his characteristics are
sublime. A devotee does not create enmity with anyone, but if someone
becomes his enemy, that person will be vanquished by the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead, despite whatever benedictions he may have received
from other sources. HiranyakaSipu was certainly enjoying the fruitful
results of his austerities, but here the Lord says that as soon as he com-
mitted an offense at the lotus feet of Prahlada Maharaja he would be
ruined. One’s longevity, opulence, beauty, education and whatever else
one may possess as a result of pious activities cannot protect one if one
commits an offense at the lotus feet of a Vaisnava. Despite whatever one
possesses, if one offends the lotus feet of a Vaisnava he will be

vanquished.

PURPORT
The less intelligent men who are always busy worshiping the demigods
should note that when the demigods are harassed by the demons, they
approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead for relief. Since the
demigods resort to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, why should the
worshipers of the demigods not approach the Supreme Lord for whatever
benefits they desire? Srimad-Bhagavatam (2.3.10) says:
akamah sarva-kamo va
moksa-kama udara-dhih
tivrena bhakti-yogena

“Whether one desires everything or nothing, or whether he desires to

scendental loving service.” Whether one is a karmi, jiidni or yogi, if one
wants a particular benediction fulfilled, even if it be material, one should
approach the Supreme Lord and pray to Him, for then it will be fulfilled.
There is no need to approach any demigod separately for the fulfillment
of any desire.

[The qualities of Maharaja Prahlada, the son of Hiranyakasipu,
are described herewith.] He was completely cultured as a qualified
brahmana, having very good character and being determined to
understand the Absolute Truth. He had full control of his senses
and mind. Like the Supersoul, he was kind to every living entity
and was the best friend of everyone. To respectable persons he
acted exactly like a menial servant, to the poor he was like a father,
to his equals he was attached like a sympathetic brother, and he
considered his teachers, spiritual masters and older Godbrothers
to be as good as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He was com-
pletely free from unnatural pride that might have arisen from his
good education, riches, beauty, aristocracy and so on.

PURPORT

These are some of the qualifications of a Vaisnava. A Vaisnava is auto-
matically a brahmana because a Vaisnava has all the good qualities of a
brahmana.

Samo damas tapah Saucam

“Peacefulness, self-control, austerity, purity, tolerance, honesty,
wisdom, knowledge, and religiousness—these are the qualities by which
the brahmanas work.” (Bg. 18.42) These qualities are manifest in the
body of a Vaisnava. Therefore a perfect Vaisnava is also a perfect
brahmana, as indicated here by the words brahmanyah sila-sampannah.
A Vaisnava is always determined to understand the Absolute Truth, and


--- Page 203 ---
198 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 4
to understand the Absolute Truth one needs to have full control over his
senses and mind. Prahlada Maharaja possessed all these qualities. A
Vaisnava is always a well-wisher to everyone. The six Gosvamis, for ex-
ample, are described in this way: dhiradhira-jana-priyau. They were
popular with both the gentle and the ruffians. A Vaisnava must be equal
to everyone, regardless of one’s position. Atmavat: a Vaisnava should be
like Paramatma. ISvarah sarva-bhitanarn hrd-dese ’rjuna tisthati.
Paramatma does not hate anyone; indeed, He is in the heart of a
brahmana, but he is also even in the heart of a pig. As the moon never
refuses to distribute its pleasing rays even to the home of a candala, a
Vaisnava never refuses to act for everyone’s welfare. Therefore a
Vaisnava is always obedient to the spiritual master (arya). The word
arya refers to one who is advanced in knowledge. One who is deficient in
knowledge cannot be called arya. At the present, however, the word
arya is used to refer to those who are godless. This is the unfortunate
situation of Kali-yuga.

The word guru refers to the spiritual master who initiates his disciple
into advancement in the science of Krsna, or Krsna consciousness, as
stated by Srila Viévanatha Cakravarti Thakura (sri-bhagavan-
mantropadesake gurav ity arthah).

TRANSLATION

Although Prahlada Maharaja was born in a family of asuras, he
himself was not an asura but a great devotee of Lord Visnu. Unlike
the other asuras, he was never envious of Vaisnavas. He was not
agitated when put into danger, and he was neither directly nor in-
directly interested in the fruitive activities described in the Vedas.
Indeed, he considered everything material to be useless, and
therefore he was completely devoid of material desires. He always
controlled his senses and life air, and being of steady intelligence
and determination, he subdued all lusty desires.

PURPORT

From this verse we discover that a man is not qualified or disqualified
simply by birth. Prahlada Maharaja was an asura by birth, yet he
possessed all the qualities of a perfect brahmana (brahmanyah sila-
sampannah). Anyone can become a fully qualified brahmana under the
direction of a spiritual master. Prahlada Maharaja provided a vivid ex-
ample of how to think of the spiritual master and accept his directions
calmly.

thoughtful and advanced in knowledge; muhuh—always; na—not; te—
these; adhuna—today; pidhiyante—are obscured; yathd—just as;

TRANSLATION

O King, Prahlada Maharaja’s good qualities are still glorified by
learned saints and Vaisnavas. As all good qualities are always found
existing in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they also exist
forever in His devotee Prahlada Maharaja.

PURPORT

From authoritative scripture it is learned that Prahlada Maharaja still
lives in Vaikunthaloka as well as within this material world on the planet
Sutala. This transcendental quality of existing simultaneously in dif-
ferent places is another qualification of the Supreme Personality of God-
head. Goloka eva nivasaty akhilatma-bhitah: the Lord appears in the
core of everyone's heart, yet He exists on His own planet, Goloka
Vrndavana. A devotee acquires qualities almost the same as those of the
Lord because of unalloyed devotional service. Ordinary living beings
cannot be so qualified, but a devotee can be qualified like the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, not in full but partially.

Maharaja as an example of a great devotee.

TRANSLATION

Who could list the innumerable transcendental qualities of
Prahlada Maharaja? He had unflinching faith in Vasudeva, Lord
Krsna [the son of Vasudeva], and unalloyed devotion to Him. His
attachment to Lord Krsna was natural because of his previous

202 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 4
devotional service. Although his good qualities cannot be enumer-
ated, they prove that he was a great soul [mahatma].
PURPORT
In his prayers to the ten incarnations, Jayadeva Gosvami says, keSava
dhrta-narahari-ripa jaya jagad-iSa hare. Prahlada Maharaja was a de-
votee of Lord Nrsimmha, who is Kesava, Krsna Himself. Therefore when
this verse says vasudeve bhagavati, one should understand that Prahlada
Maharaja’s attachment for Nrsimhadeva was attachment for Krsna,
Vasudeva, the son of Vasudeva. Prahlada Maharaja, therefore, is de-
scribed as a great mahatma. As the Lord Himself confirms in Bhagavad-
gita (7.19):
bahanari janmanam ante
JAdnavan mari prapadyate
vasudevah sarvam iti

sa mahatma sudurlabhah
‘After many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surren-
ders unto Me, knowing Me to be the cause of all causes and all that is.
Such a great soul is very rare.”” A great devotee of Krsna, the son of
Vasudeva, is a great soul very rarely to be found. Prahlada Maharaja’s
attachment for Krsna will be explained in the next verse. Krsna-graha-
grhitatma. Prahlada Maharaja’s heart was always filled with thoughts of
Krsna. Therefore Prahlada Maharaja is the ideal devotee in Krsna
consciousness.

TRANSLATION

From the very beginning of his childhood, Prahlada Maharaja
was uninterested in childish playthings. Indeed, he gave them up
altogether and remained silent and dull, being fully absorbed in
Krsna consciousness. Since his mind was always affected by Krsna
consciousness, he could not understand how the world goes on
being fully absorbed in the activities of sense gratification.

PURPORT

Prahlada Maharaja is the vivid example of a great person fully ab-
sorbed in Krsna consciousness. In Caitanya-caritamrta (Madhya 8.274)
it is said:

sthavara-jarigama dekhe, na dekhe tara miirti
sarvatra haya nija ista-deva-sphiirti
A fully Krsna conscious person, although situated in this material world,
does not see anything but Krsna, anywhere and everywhere. This is the
sign of a maha-bhagavata. The maha-bhagavata sees Krsna everywhere
because of his attitude of pure love for Krsna. As confirmed in the
Brahma-sarhita (5.38):
premanjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena
santah sadaiva hrdayesu vilokayanti
yam $yamasundaram acintya-guna-svaripari
govindam adi-purusarm tam ahari bhajami

“न्‌ worship the primeval Lord, Govinda, who is always seen by the devo-
tee whose eyes are anointed with the pulp of love. He is seen in His eter-
nal form of Syamasundara, situated within the heart of the devotee.” An
exalted devotee, or mahatma, who is rarely to be seen, remains fully
conscious of Krsna and constantly sees the Lord within the core of his


--- Page 209 ---
204 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 4
heart. It is sometimes said that when one is influenced by evil stars like
Saturn, Riahu or Ketu, he cannot make advancement in any prospective
activity. In just the opposite way, Prahlada Maharaja was influenced by
Krsna, the supreme planet, and thus he could not think of the material
world and live without Krsna consciousness. That is the sign of a maha-
bhagavata. Even if one is an enemy of Krsna, a maha-bhagavata sees
him to be also engaged in Krsna’s service. Another crude example is that
everything appears yellow to the jaundiced eye. Similarly, to a maha-
bhagavata, everyone but himself appears to be engaged in Krsna’s
service.

Prahlada Maharaja is the approved maha-bhagavata, the supreme de-
votee. In the previous verse it was stated that he had natural attachment
(naisargikt ratih). The symptoms of such natural attachment for Krsna
are described in this verse. Although Prahlada Maharaja was only a boy,
he had no interest in playing. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam
(11.2.42), viraktir anyatra ca: the symptom of perfect Krsna conscious-
ness is that one loses interest in all material activities. For a small boy to
give up playing is impossible, but Prahlada Maharaja, being situated in
first-class devotional service, was always absorbed in a trance of Krsna
consciousness. Just as a materialistic person is always absorbed in
thoughts of material gain, a maha-bhagavata like Prahlada Maharaja is
always absorbed in thoughts of Krsna.

TRANSLATION
Prahlada Maharaja was always absorbed in thought of Krsna.
Thus, being always embraced by the Lord, he did not know how
his bodily necessities, such as sitting, walking, eating, lying down,
drinking and talking, were being automatically performed.
PURPORT
A small child, while being cared for by his mother, does not know how
the needs of the body for eating, sleeping, lying down, passing water and
evacuating are being fulfilled. He is simply satisfied to be on the lap of
his mother. Similarly, Prahlada Maharaja was exactly like a small child,
being cared for by Govinda. The necessary activities of his body were
performed without his knowledge. As a father and mother care for their
child, Govinda cared for Prahlada Maharaja, who remained always ab-
sorbed in thoughts of Govinda. This is Krsna consciousness. Prahlada
Maharaja is the vivid example of perfection in Krsna consciousness.

TRANSLATION
Because of advancement in Krsna consciousness, he sometimes

sometimes sang loudly.
PURPORT
This verse further clarifies the comparison of a devotee to a child. If a
mother leaves her small child in his bed or cradle and goes away to attend
to some family duties, the child immediately understands that his mother
has gone away, and therefore he cries. But as soon as the mother returns
and cares for the child, the child laughs and becomes jubilant. Similarly,
Prahlada Maharaja, being always absorbed in thoughts of Krsna, some-
times felt separation, thinking, “Where is Krsna?”” This is explained by
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Sanyayitari jagat sarvam govinda-virahena
me. When an exalted devotee feels that Krsna is invisible, having gone
away, he cries in separation, and sometimes, when he sees that Krsna has
returned to care for him, he laughs, just as a child sometimes laughs
upon understanding that his mother is taking care of him. These
symptoms are called bhava. In The Nectar of Devotion, various bhavas,
ecstatic conditions of a devotee, are fully described. These bhavas are
visible in the activities of a perfect devotee.

TRANSLATION

Sometimes, upon seeing the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Prahlada Maharaja would loudly call in full anxiety. He sometimes
lost his shyness in jubilation and began dancing in ecstasy, and
sometimes, being fully absorbed in thoughts of Krsna, he felt one-
ness and imitated the pastimes of the Lord.

PURPORT

Prahlada Maharaja sometimes felt that the Lord was far away from
him and therefore called Him loudly. When he saw that the Lord was
before him, he was fully jubilant. Sometimes, thinking himself one with
the Supreme, he imitated the Lord’s pastimes, and in separation from the
Lord he would sometimes show symptoms of madness. These feelings of
a devotee would not be appreciated by impersonalists. One must go
further and further into spiritual understanding. The first realization is
impersonal Brahman, but one must go still further to realize Paramatma
and eventually the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is worshiped
by the transcendental feelings of a devotee in a relationship of santa,
dasya, sakhya, vatsalya or madhurya. Here the feelings of Prahlada
Maharaja were in the mellow of vatsalya, filial love and affection. As a
child cries when left by his mother, when Prahlada Maharaja felt that the
Lord was away from him he began to cry (nadati). Again, a devotee like
Prahlada sometimes sees that the Lord is coming from a long distance to
pacify him, like a mother responding to a child, saying, “My dear child,
do not cry. I am coming.” Then the devotee, without being ashamed due
to his surroundings and circumstances, begins to dance, thinking, “Here
is my Lord! My Lord is coming!” Thus the devotee, in full ecstasy, some-
times imitates the pastimes of the Lord, just as the cowherd boys used to
imitate the behavior of the jungle animals. However, he does not actually
become the Lord. Prahlada Maharaja achieved the spiritual ecstasies de-
scribed herein by his advancement in spiritual understanding.

Sometimes, feeling the touch of the Lord’s lotus hands, he be-

his love for the Lord.
PURPORT
When a devotee feels separation from the Lord, he becomes eager to
see where the Lord is, and sometimes when he feels pangs of separation,
tears flow incessantly from his half-closed eyes. As stated by Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu in His Siksastaka, yugayitarn nimesena caksusa
pravrsayitam. The words caksusa pravrsayitam refer to tears falling in-
cessantly from the devotee’s eyes. These symptoms, which appear in
pure devotional ecstasy, were visible in the body of Prahlada Maharaja.

TRANSLATION

Because of his association with perfect, unalloyed devotees who
had nothing to do with anything material, Prahlada Maharaja con-
stantly engaged in the service of the Lord’s lotus feet. By seeing
his bodily features when he was in perfect ecstasy, persons very
poor in spiritual understanding became purified. In other words,
Prahlada Maharaja bestowed upon them transcendental bliss.

PURPORT

Apparently Prahlada Maharaja was placed in circumstances in which
he was always tortured by his father. In such material conditions, one
cannot have an undisturbed mind, but since bhakti is unconditional
(ahaituky apratihata), Prahlada Maharaja was never disturbed by the
chastisements of Hiranyakasipu. On the contrary, the bodily symptoms
of his ecstatic love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead turned the
minds of his friends, who had also been born in atheistic families. In-
stead of being disturbed by the torments of his father, Prahlada in-
fluenced these friends and cleansed their minds. A devotee is never
contaminated by material conditions, but persons subjected to material
conditions can become spiritually advanced and blissful upon seeing the
behavior of a pure devotee.

PURPORT
When a demon like Hiranyakasipu, despite his elevated position due to
severe austerities, begins to tease a devotee, he begins falling down, and
the results of his austerities dwindle. One who oppresses a pure devotee
loses all the results of his austerities, penances and pious activities. Since
HiranyakaSipu was now inclined to chastise his most exalted devotee son,
Prahlada Maharaja, his opulences began dwindling.

demigods, O best of spiritual leaders, how did Hiranyakasipu give
so much trouble to Prahlada Maharaja, the pure and exalted saint,
although Prahlada was his own son? I wish to know about this sub-
ject from you.

PURPORT

To know about the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the charac-
teristics of His pure devotee, one must inquire from authorities like
Devarsi Narada. One cannot inquire about transcendental subject matters
from a layman. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (3.25.25), satam
prasarnigan mama virya-sariwido bhavanti hrt-karna-rasayanah kathah:
only by association with devotees can one authoritatively understand the
position of the Lord and His devotees. A devotee like Narada Muni is ad-
dressed as suvrata. Su means “good,” and vrata means “vow.” Thus the
word suvrata refers to a person who has nothing to do with the material
world, which is always bad. One cannot understand anything spiritual
from a materialistic scholar puffed up with academic knowledge. As
stated in Bhagavad-gita (18.55), bhaktya mam abhijanati: one must try
to understand Krsna by devotional service and from a devotee. Therefore
Yudhisthira Maharaja was quite right in wanting to learn further about
Prahlada Maharaja from Sri Narada Muni.

Maharaja Yudhisthira further inquired: How was it possible for
a father to be so violent toward an exalted son who was obedient,
well-behaved and respectful to his father? O brahmana, O master,
I have never heard of such a contradiction as an affectionate
father’s punishing his noble son with the intention of killing him.
Kindly dissipate our doubts in this regard.

PURPORT

In the history of human society, an affectionate father is rarely found
to chastise a noble and devoted son. Therefore Maharaja Yudhisthira
wanted Narada Muni to dissipate his doubt.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Seventh Canto, Fourth
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled, “Hiranyakasipu Terrorizes
the Universe.”


--- Page 219 ---
CHAPTER FIVE
Prahlada Maharaja,
the Saintly Son of HiranyakaSipu
Prahlada Maharaja did not carry out the orders of his teachers, for he
was always engaged in worshiping Lord Visnu. As described in this
chapter, Hiranyaka$ipu tried to kill Prahlada Maharaja, even by having a
snake bite him and by putting him under the feet of elephants, yet he
was unsuccessful. ,

HiranyakaSipu’s spiritual master, Sukracarya, had two sons named
Sanda and Amarka, to whom Prahlada Maharaja was entrusted for
education. Although the teachers tried to educate the boy Prahlada in
politics, economics and other material activities, he did not care for their
instructions. Instead, he continued to be a pure devotee. Prahlada
Maharaja never liked the idea of discriminating between one’s friends
and enemies. Because he was spiritually inclined, he was equal toward
everyone.

Once upon a time, Hiranyaka$ipu inquired from his son what the best
thing was that he had learned from his teachers. Prahlada Maharaja
replied that a man engrossed in the material consciousness of duality,
thinking, “This is mine, and that belongs to my enemy,’” should give up
his householder life and go to the forest to worship the Supreme Lord.

When Hiranyaka$ipu heard from his son about devotional service, he
decided that this small boy had been polluted by some friend in school.
Thus he advised the teachers to take care of the boy so that he would not
become a Krsna conscious devotee. However, when the teachers inquired
from Prahlada Maharaja why he was going against their teachings,
Prahlada Maharaja taught the teachers that the mentality of ownership is
false and that he was therefore trying to become an unalloyed devotee of
Lord Visnu. The teachers, being very angry at this answer, chastised and
threatened the boy with many fearful conditions. They taught him to the
best of their ability and then brought him before his father.

Hiranyakasipu affectionately took his son Prahlada on his lap and then
inquired from him what the best thing was that he had learned from his

215


--- Page 220 ---
216 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 5
teachers. As usual, Prahlada Maharaja began praising the nine processes
of devotional service, such as Sravanam and kirtanam. Thus the King of
the demons, HiranyakaSipu, being extremely angry, chastised the
teachers, Sanda and Amarka, for having wrongly trained Prahlada
Maharaja. The so-called teachers informed the King that Prahlada
Maharaja was automatically a devotee and did not listen to their instruc-
tions. When they proved themselves innocent, HiranyakaSipu inquired
from Prahlada where he had learned visnu-bhakti. Prahlada Maharaja
replied that those who are attached to family life do not develop Krsna
consciousness, either personally or collectively. Instead, they suffer re-
peated birth and death in this material world and continue simply chew-
ing the chewed. Prahlada explained that the duty of every man is to take
shelter of a pure devotee and thus become eligible to understand Krsna
consciousness.

Enraged at this answer, Hiranyaka$ipu threw Prahlada Maharaja from
his lap. Since Prahlada was so treacherous that he had become a devotee
of Visnu, who had killed his uncle Hiranyaksa, Hiranyaka$ipu asked his
assistants to kill him. The assistants of Hiranyakasipu struck Prahlada
with sharp weapons, threw him under the feet of elephants, subjected
him to hellish conditions, threw him from the peak of a mountain and
tried to kill him in thousands of other ways, but they were unsuccessful.
Hiranyakasipu therefore became increasingly afraid of his son Prahlada
Maharaja and arrested him. The sons of Hiranyakadipu’s spiritual
master, Sukracirya, began teaching Prahlada in their own way, but
Prahlada Maharaja did not accept their instructions. While the teachers
were absent from the classroom, Prahlada Maharaja began to preach
Krsna consciousness in the school, and by his instructions all his class
friends, the sons of the demons, became devotees like him.

Sri-naradah uvdca—the great saint Narada said; paurohityaya—to
work as priest; bhagavan—the most powerful; vrtah—chosen;
kavyah—Sukracarya; kila—indeed; asurath—by the demons; sanda-
amarkau—S$Sanda and Amarka; sutau—sons; tasya—of him; daitya-
raja—of the King of the demons, Hiranyakasipu; grha-antike—near the
residence.

TRANSLATION

The great saint Narada Muni said: The demons, headed by
Hiranyakasipu, accepted Sukracirya as their priest for ritualistic
ceremonies. Sukracarya’s two sons, Sanda and Amarka, lived near
Hiranyakasipu’s palace.

PURPORT
„ The beginning of the life story of Prahlada is recounted as follows.
Sukracarya became the priest of the atheists, especially Hiranyaka$ipu,
and thus his two sons, Sanda and Amarka, resided near Hiranyakasipu’s
residence. Sukracirya should not have become the priest of
Hiranyaka$ipu because Hiranyakasipu and his followers were all
atheists. A brahmana should become the priest of a person interested in
the advancement of spiritual culture. The very name Sukracarya,
however, indicates a person interested in obtaining benefits for his sons
and descendants, regardless of how the money comes. A real brahmana
would not become a priest for atheistic men.

educated, they accepted him at their school along with the other
sons of the asuras.

Prahlada certainly heard and recited the topics of politics and
economics taught by the teachers, but he understood that political
philosophy involves considering someone a friend and someone
else an enemy, and thus he did not like it.

Text 4] Prahlada, the Saintly Son of Hiranyakasipu 219
PURPORT

Politics involves accepting one group of men as enemies and another
group as friends. Everything in politics is based on this philosophy, and
the entire world, especially at the present, is engrossed in it. The public
is concerned with friendly countries and friendly groups or enemy coun-
tries and enemy groups, but as stated in Bhagavad-gita, a learned person
does not make distinctions between enemies and friends. Devotees, es-
pecially, do not create friends and enemies. A devotee sees that every liv-
ing being is part and parcel of Krsna (mamaivamso jiva-bhutah).
Therefore a devotee treats friends and enemies equally by trying to edu-
cate them both in Krsna consciousness. Of course, atheistic men do not
follow the instructions of pure devotees, but instead consider a devotee
their enemy. A devotee, however, never creates a situation of friendship
and enmity. Although Prahlada Maharaja was obliged to hear the in-
structions of Sanda and Amarka, he did not like the philosophy of
friends and enemies, which forms the basis of politics. He was not in-
terested in this philosophy.

220 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 5
affectionately inquired: My dear son, please let me know what you
think is the best of all the subjects you have studied from your
teachers.
PURPORT
Hiranyakasipu did not ask his young son anything that would be very
difficult for him to answer; instead, he gave the boy a chance to speak
plainly about whatever he thought might be best. Prahlada Maharaja, of
course, being a perfect devotee, knew everything and could say what the
best part of life is. In the Vedas it is said, yasmin vijidate sarvam evari
vijaatari bhavati: if one properly understands God, he can understand
any subject matter very nicely. Sometimes we have to challenge big
scientists and philosophers, but by the grace of Krsna we emerge suc-
cessful. It is impossible, practically speaking, for ordinary men to
challenge scientists or philosophers concerning genuine knowledge, but a
devotee can challenge them because the best of everything is known to a
devotee by the grace of Krsna. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (10.11):
tesam evanukampdrtham
aham ajiiana-jarin tamah
ndasayamy atma-bhava-stho
jhaana-dipena bhasvata
Krsna, who is situated in the core of everyone’s heart as the Supersoul,
dissipates all the ignorance from the heart of a devotee. As a special
favor, He enlightens the devotee with all knowledge by putting before
him the torch of light. Prahlada Maharaja, therefore, knew the best of
knowledge, and when his father inquired from him, Prahlada gave him
that knowledge. Prahlada Maharaja was able to solve the most difficult
parts of problems because of his advanced Krsna consciousness.
Therefore he replied as follows.

very good, or the best part of life; manye—I think; asura-varya—O
King of the asuras; dehinam—of persons who have accepted the ma-
terial body; sada—always; samudvigna—full of anxieties; dhiyam—
whose intelligence; asat-grahat—because of accepting the temporary
body or bodily relations as real (thinking "व am this body, and every-
thing belonging to this body is mine”); hitud—giving up; atma-
patam—the place where spiritual culture or self-realization is stopped;
grham—the bodily concept of life, or household life; andha-kipam—
which is nothing but a blind well (where there is no water but one none-
theless searches for water); vanam—to the forest; gatah—going; yat—
which; harim—the Supreme Personality of Godhead; asrayeta—may
take shelter of.
TRANSLATION
Prahlada Maharaja replied: O best of the asuras, King of the
demons, as far as I have learned from my spiritual master, any per-
son who has accepted a temporary body and temporary household
life is certainly embarrassed by anxiety because of having fallen in
a dark well where there is no water but only suffering. One should
give up this position and go to the forest [vana]. More clearly, one
should go to Vrndavana, where only Krsna consciousness is pre-
valent, and should thus take shelter of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead.
PURPORT
HiranyakaSipu thought that Prahlada, being nothing but a small boy
with no actual experience, might reply with something pleasing but


--- Page 226 ---
222 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 5
nothing practical. Prahlada Maharaja, however, being an exalted devo-
tee, had acquired all the qualities of education.
yasyasti bhaktir bhagavaty akificana
sarvair gunais tatra samdsate surah
harav abhaktasya kuto mahad-guna
manorathenasati dhavato bahih

“One who has unflinching devotional faith in Krsna consistently
manifests all the good qualities of Krsna and the demigods. However, he
who has no devotion to the Supreme Personality of Godhead has no good
qualifications because he is engaged by mental concoction in material ex-
istence, which is the external feature of the Lord.” (Bhag. 5.18.12) So-
called educated philosophers and scientists who are simply on the mental
platform cannot distinguish between what is actually sat, eternal, and
what is asat, temporary. The Vedic injunction is asato ma jyotir gama:
everyone should give up the platform of temporary existence and ap-
proach the eternal platform. The soul is eternal, and topics concerning
the eternal soul are actually knowledge. Elsewhere it is said, apasyatam
atma-tattvarin grhesu grha-medhinam: those who are attached to the
bodily conception of life and who thus stick to life as a grhastha, or
householder, on the platform of material sense enjoyment, cannot see the
welfare of the eternal soul. Prahlada Maharaja confirmed this by saying
that if one wants success in life, he should immediately understand from
the right sources what his self-interest is and how he should mold his life
in spiritual consciousness. One should understand himself to be part and
parcel of Krsna and thus completely take shelter of His lotus feet for
guaranteed spiritual success. Everyone in the material world is in the
bodily conception, struggling hard for existence, life after life. Prahlada
Maharaja therefore recommended that to stop this material condition of
repeated birth and death, one should go to the forest (vana).

In the varndsrama system, one first becomes a brahmacari, then a
grhastha, a vanaprastha and finally a sannydst. Going to the forest
means accepting vanaprastha life, which is between grhastha life and
sannydsa. As confirmed in the Vispu Purana (3.8.9), varndsra-
macaravata purusena parah puman visnur aradhyate: by accepting the
institution of varna and dsrama, one can very easily elevate himself to


--- Page 227 ---
Text 6] Prahlada, the Saintly Son of HiranyakaSipu 223
the platform of worshiping Visnu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Otherwise, if one remains in the bodily conception, one must rot within
this material world, and his life will be a failure. Society must have divi-
sions of brahmana, ksatriya, vaiSya and Sidra, and for spiritual ad-
vancement one must gradually develop as a brahmacari, grhastha,
vanaprastha and sannyasi. Prahlada Maharaja recommended that his
father accept vanaprastha life because as a grhastha he was becoming in-
creasingly demoniac due to bodily attachment. Prahlada recommended to
his father that accepting vanaprastha life would be better than going
deeper and deeper into grham andha-kipam, the blind well of life as a
grhastha. In our Krsna consciousness movement we therefore invite all
the elderly persons of the world to come to Vrndavana and stay there in
retired life, making advancement in spiritual consciousness, Krsna
consciousness.

TRANSLATION
Narada Muni continued: When Prahlada Maharaja spoke about
the path of self-realization in devotional service, thus being


--- Page 228 ---
224 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 5
faithful to the camp of his father’s enemies, Hiranyaka$ipu, the
King of the demons, heard Prahlada’s words and he laughingly
said, ““Thus is the intelligence of children spoiled by the words of
the enemy.”
PURPORT

Hiranyakas$ipu, being a demon, would always consider Lord Visnu and
His devotees to be his enemies. Therefore the word para-paksa (“on the
side of the enemy”) is used here. Hiranyakasipu never agreed with the
words of Visnu, or Krsna. Rather, he was angered by the intelligence of a
Vaisnava. Lord Visnu, Lord Krsna, says, sarva-dharman parityajya
mam 61077 Saranari vraja—*‘Give up all other duties and surrender
unto Me’ —but demons like HiranyakaSipu never agree to do this.
Therefore Krsna says:

na mam duskrtino miidhah
prapadyante naradhamah
mayayapahrta-jiana
asurarn bhavam asritah
“Those miscreants who are grossly foolish, lowest among mankind,
whose knowledge is stolen by illusion, and who partake of the atheistic
nature of demons, do not surrender unto Me.” (Bg. 7.15) The asura-
bhava, the atheistic nature, is directly represented by Hiranyakasipu.
Such persons, being miidha and nar@dhama—fools and rascals, the
lowest of men —would never accept Visnu as the Supreme and surrender
to Him. Hiranyaka$ipu naturally became increasingly angry that his son
Prahlada was being influenced by the camp of the enemies. He therefore
asked that saintly persons like Narada not be allowed within the residen-
tial quarters of his son, for otherwise Prahlada would be further spoiled
by Vaisnava instructions.

TRANSLATION

HiranyakaSipu advised his assistants: My dear demons, give
complete protection to this boy at the guru-kula where he is in-
structed, so that his intelligence will not be further influenced by
Vaisnavas who may go there in disguise.

PURPORT

In our Krsna consciousness movement, the tactic of dressing oneself
like an ordinary karmi is necessary because everyone in the demoniac
kingdom is against the Vaisnava teachings. Krsna consciousness is not at
all to the liking of the demons of the present age. As soon as they see a
Vaisnava dressed in saffron garments with beads on his neck and tilaka
on his forehead, they are immediately irritated. They criticize the
Vaisnavas by sarcastically saying Hare Krsna, and some people also chant
Hare Krsna sincerely. In either case, since Hare Krsna is absolute,
whether one chants it jokingly or sincerely, it will have its effect. The
Vaisnavas are pleased when the demons chant Hare Krsna because this
shows that the Hare Krsna movement is taking ground. The greater
demons, like Hiranyakasipu, are always prepared to chastise the
Vaisnavas, and they try to make arrangements so that Vaisnavas will not
come to sell their books and preach Krsna consciousness. Thus what was
done by Hiranyakasipu long, long ago is still being done. That is the way
of materialistic life. Demons or materialists do not at all like the advance-
ment of Krsna consciousness, and they try to hinder it in many ways. Yet


--- Page 230 ---
226 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 5
the preachers of Krsna consciousness must go forward—in their
Vaisnava dress or any other dress—for the purpose of preaching.
Canakya Pandita says that if an honest person deals with a great cheater,
it is necessary for him to become a cheater also, not for the purpose of
cheating but to make his preaching successful.

the priests of the demons, Sanda and Amarka, pacified him. With
very mild voices and affectionate words, they inquired from him as
follows.
PURPORT
Sanda and Amarka, the priests of the demons, were eager to know
from Prahlada Maharaja who the Vaisnavas were that came to instruct
him in Krsna consciousness. Their purpose was to discover the names of
these Vaisnavas. In the beginning they did not threaten the boy because
when threatened he might not identify the real culprits. Therefore they
very mildly and peacefully inquired as follows.

not like you, for they do not speak in a deviant way. How have you
learned these instructions? How has your intelligence been
spoiled in this way?

PURPORT

Prahlada Maharaja was still a boy, and therefore his teachers thought
that if they pacified the little boy he would immediately speak the truth,
revealing the secret of how the Vaisnavas came there to teach him lessons
in devotional service. It was surprising, of course, that in the same school
the other boys of the Daityas were not polluted; only Prahlada Maharaja
was supposedly polluted by the instructions of the Vaisnavas. The main
duty of the teachers was to inquire who those Vaisnavas were that came
to teach Prahlada and spoil his intelligence.

Prahlada Maharaja’s teachers were astonished that a small boy could
speak such exalted Vaisnava philosophy. Therefore they inquired about
the Vaispavas who stealthily taught it to him, in order that these
Vaisnavas might be arrested and killed in the presence of Prahlada’s
father, Hiranyakasipu.

Prahlada Maharaja replied: Let me offer my respectful obei-

energy has created the distinctions of (तङ friend” and “my
enemy’’ by deluding the intelligence of men. Indeed, I am now ac-
tually experiencing this, although I have previously heard of it
from authoritative sources.

PURPORT
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (5.18):
vidya-vinaya-sampanne
brahmane gavi hastini
Suni caiva Svapake ca
panditah sama-darsinah
“The humble sage, by virtue of true knowledge, sees with equal vision a
learned and gentle brahmana, a cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater
[outcaste].”” Panditah, those who are actually learned —the equipoised,
advanced devotees who have full knowledge of everything—do not see
any living entity as an enemy or friend. Instead, with broader vision,
they see that everyone is part of Krsna, as confirmed by Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu (jivera ‘svaripa’ haya—krsnera ‘nitya-dasa’). Every liv-
ing entity, being part of the Supreme Lord, is meant to serve the Lord,
just as every part of the body is meant to serve the whole body.

As servants of the Supreme Lord, all living entities are one, but a
Vaisnava, because of his natural humility, addresses every other living
entity as prabhu. A Vaisnava sees other servants to be so advanced that
he has much to learn from them. Thus he accepts all other devotees of
the Lord as prabhus, masters. Although everyone is a servant of the
Lord, one Vaisnava servant, because of humility, sees another servant as


--- Page 234 ---
230 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 5
his master. Understanding of the master begins from understanding of
the spiritual master.
yasya prasadad bhagavat-prasado
yasyaprasadan na gatih kuto ’pi
“By the mercy of the spiritual master one receives the benediction of
Krsna. Without the grace of the spiritual master, one cannot make any
advancement.”
saksad-dharitvena samasta-$astrair
uktas tatha bhavyata eva sadbhih
kintu prabhor yah priya eva tasya
vande guroh sri-carandravindam
“The spiritual master is to be honored as much as the Supreme Lord be-
cause he is the most confidential servitor of the Lord. This is
acknowledged in all revealed scriptures and followed by all authorities.
Therefore I offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of such a
spiritual master, who is a bona fide representative of Sri Hari [Krsnal.”
The spiritual master, the servant of God, is engaged in the most confi-
dential service of the Lord, namely delivering all the conditioned souls
from the clutches of maya, in which one thinks, “This person is my
enemy, and that one is my friend.” Actually the Supreme Personality of
Godhead is the friend of all living entities, and all living entities are eter-
nal servants of the Supreme Lord. Oneness is possible through this
understanding, not through artificially thinking that every one of us is
God or equal to God. The true understanding is that God is the supreme
master and that all of us are servants of the Supreme Lord and are
therefore on the same platform. This had already been taught to
Prahlada Maharaja by his spiritual master, Narada, but Prahlada was
nonetheless surprised by how a bewildered soul thinks one person his
enemy and another his friend.

As long as one adheres to the philosophy of duality, thinking one per-
son a friend and another an enemy, he should be understood to be in the
clutches of maya. The Mayavadi philosopher who thinks that all living
entities are God and are therefore one is also mistaken. No one is equal to


--- Page 235 ---
Text 12] Prahlada, the Saintly Son of Hiranyakasipu 231
God. The servant cannot be equal to the master. According to the
Vaisnava philosophy, the master is one, and the servants are also one,
but the distinction between the master and servant must continue even
in the liberated stage. In the conditioned stage we think that some living
beings are our friends whereas others are enemies, and thus we are in
duality. In the liberated stage, however, the conception is that God is the
master and that all living entities, being servants of God, are one.

TRANSLATION
When the Supreme Personality of Godhead is pleased with the
living entity because of his devotional service, one becomes a
pandita and does not make distinctions between enemies, friends
and himself. Intelligently, he then thinks, “Every one of us is an
eternal servant of God, and therefore we are not different from
one another.”
PURPORT
When Prahlada Maharaja’s teachers and demoniac father asked him
how his intelligence had been polluted, Prahlada Maharaja said, “As far
as I am concerned, my intelligence has not been polluted. Rather, by the


--- Page 236 ---
232 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 5
grace of my spiritual master and by the grace of my Lord, Krsna, I have
now learned that no one is my enemy and no one is my friend. We are all
actually eternal servants of Krsna, but under the influence of the exter-
nal energy we think that we are separately situated from the Supreme
Personality of Godhead as friends and enemies of one another. This
mistaken idea has now been corrected, and therefore, unlike ordinary
human beings, I no longer think that I am God and that others are my
friends and enemies. Now I am rightly thinking that everyone is an eter-
nal servant of God and that our duty is to serve the supreme master, for
then we shall stand on the platform of oneness as servants.”

Demons think of everyone as a friend or enemy, but Vaisnavas say
that since everyone is a servant of the Lord, everyone is on the same plat-
form. Therefore a Vaisnava treats other living entities neither as friends
nor as enemies, but instead tries to spread Krsna consciousness, teaching
everyone that we are all one as servants of the Supreme Lord but are
uselessly wasting our valuable lives by creating nations, communities
and other groups of friends and enemies. Everyone should come to the
platform of Krsna consciousness and thus feel oneness as a servant of the
Lord. Although there are 8,400,000 species of life, a Vaisnava feels this
oneness. The Iopanisad advises, ekatvam anupasyatah. A devotee
should see the Supreme Personality of Godhead to be situated in every-
one’s heart and should also see every living entity as an eternal servant
of the Lord. This vision is called ekatvam, oneness. Although there is a
relationship of master and servant, both master and servant are one be-
cause of their spiritual identity. This is also ekatvam. Thus the concep-
tion of ekatvam for the Vaisnava is different from that of the Mayavadi.

HiranyakaSipu asked Prahlada Maharaja how he had become an-
tagonistic to his family. When a family member is killed by an enemy, all
the members of the family would naturally be inimical to the murderer,
but HiranyakaSipu saw that Prahlada had become friendly with the mur-
derer. Therefore he asked, “Who has created this kind of intelligence in
you? Have you developed this consciousness by yourself? Since you are a
small boy, someone must have induced you to think this way.” Prahlada
Maharaja wanted to reply that an attitude favorable toward Visnu can
develop only when the Lord is favorable (sa yadanuvratah). As stated in
Bhagavad-gita, Krsna is the friend of everyone (suhrdam sarva-
bhatanar jiiatva mar $antim rcchati). The Lord is never an enemy to


--- Page 237 ---
Text 12] Prahlada, the Saintly Son of Hiranyakasipu 233
any of the millions of living entities, but is always a friend to everyone.
This is true understanding. If one thinks that the Lord is an enemy, his
intelligence is pasu-buddhi, the intelligence of an animal. He falsely
thinks, “I am different from my enemy, and my enemy is different from
me. The enemy has done this, and therefore my duty is to kill him.” This
misconception is described in this verse as bheda-gatasati. The actual
fact is that everyone is a servant of the Lord, as confirmed in Caitanya-
caritamrta by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu (jivera ‘svariapa’ haya—
krsnera ‘nitya-ddsa’). As servants of the Lord, we are one, and there can
be no questions of enmity or friendship. If one actually understands that
every one of us is a servant of the Lord, where is the question of enemy
or friend?

Everyone should be friendly for the service of the Lord. Everyone
should praise another’s service to the Lord and not be proud of his own
service. This is the way of Vaisnava thinking, Vaikuntha thinking.
There may be rivalries and apparent competition between servants in
performing service, but in the Vaikuntha planets the service of another
servant is appreciated, not condemned. This is Vaikuntha competition.
There is no question of enmity between servants. Everyone should be
allowed to render service to the Lord to the best of his ability, and every-
one should appreciate the service of others. Such are the activities of
Vaikuntha. Since everyone is a servant, everyone is on the same platform
and is allowed to serve the Lord according to his ability. As confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita (15.15), sarvasya cahari hrdi sannivisto mattah smrtir
Jianam apohanari ca: the Lord is situated in everyone’s heart, giving
dictation according to the attitude of the servant. However, the Lord
gives different dictation to the nondevotees and devotees. The non-
devotees challenge the authority of the Supreme Lord, and therefore the
Lord dictates in such a way that the nondevotees forget the Lord’s ser-
vice, life after life, and are punished by the laws of nature. But when a
devotee very sincerely wants to render service to the Lord, the Lord dic-
tates in a different way. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (10.10):

tesari satata-yuktanar
bhajatarn priti-piarvakam

dadami buddhi-yogari tari
yena mam upayanti te


--- Page 238 ---
234 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 5
“To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give
the understanding by which they can come to Me.” Everyone is actually a
servant, not an enemy or friend, and everyone is working under dif-
ferent directions from the Lord, who directs each living entity according
to his mentality.

same Supreme Personality of Godhead who has created this situa-
tion has certainly given me the intelligence to take the side of your
so-called enemy.

PURPORT
Prahlada Maharaja admitted frankly, “My dear teachers, you wrongly
think that Lord Visnu is your enemy, but because He is favorable toward
me, I understand that He is the friend of everyone. You may think that I
have taken the side of your enemy, but factually He has bestowed a great
favor upon me.”

TRANSLATION
O brahmanas [teachers], as iron attracted by a magnetic stone
moves automatically toward the magnet, my consciousness, having
been changed by His will, is attracted by Lord Visnu, who carries a
disc in His hand. Thus I have no independence.
PURPORT
For iron to be attracted by a magnet is natural. Similarly, for all living
entities to be attracted toward Krsna is natural, and therefore the Lord's
real name is Krsna, meaning He who attracts everyone and everything.
The typical examples of such attraction are found in Vrndavana, where
everything and everyone is attracted by Krsna. The elderly persons like
Nanda Maharaja and YaSodadevi, the friends like Sridama, Sudima and


--- Page 240 ---
236 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 5
the other cowherd boys, the gopis like Srimati Radharani and Her asso-
ciates, and even the birds, beasts, cows and calves are attracted. The
flowers and fruits in the gardens are attracted, the waves of the Yamuna
are attracted, and the land, sky, trees, plants, animals and all other living
beings are attracted by Krsna. This is the natural situation of everything
in Vrndavana.

Just contrary to the affairs of Vrndavana is the material world, where
no one is attracted by Krsna and everyone is attracted by maya. This is
the difference between the spiritual and material worlds. Hiranyakasipu,
who was in the material world, was attracted by women and money,
whereas Prahlada Maharaja, being in his natural position, was attracted
by Krsna. In replying to Hiranyaka$ipu’s question about why Prahlada
Maharaja had a deviant view, Prahlada said that his view was not
deviant, for the natural position of everyone is to be attracted by Krsna.
HiranyakasSipu found this view deviant, Prahlada said, because of being
unnaturally unattracted by Krsna. HiranyakaSipu therefore needed
purification.

As soon as one is purified of material contamination, he is again at-
tracted by Krsna (sarvopadhi-vinirmuktari tat-paratvena nirmalam). In ;
the material world, everyone is contaminated by the dirt of sense gra-
tification and is acting according to different designations, sometimes as a
human being, sometimes a beast, sometimes a demigod or tree, and so on.
One must be cleansed of all these designations. Then one will be
naturally attracted to Krsna. The bhakti process purifies the living entity
of all unnatural attractions. When one is purified he is attracted by Krsna
and begins to serve Krsna instead of serving maya. This is his natural
position. A devotee is attracted by Krsna, whereas a nondevotee, being
contaminated by the dirt of material enjoyment, is not. This is confirmed
by the Lord in Bhagavad-gita (7.28):

yesam tv anta-gatar papa
Jjananar punya-karmanam
te dvandva-moha-nirmukta
bhajante mari drdha-vratah
“Persons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life, whose
sinful actions are completely eradicated and who are freed from the


--- Page 241 ---
Text 15] Prahlada, the Saintly Son of HiranyakaSipu 237
duality of delusion, engage themselves in My service with determina-
tion.” One must be freed from all the sinful dirt of material existence.
Everyone in this material world is contaminated by material desire. Un-
less one is free from all material desire (anyabhilasita-sanyam), one
cannot be attracted by Krsna.

TRANSLATION
The great saint Narada Muni continued: The great soul Prahlada
Maharaja became silent after saying this to his teachers, Sanda and
Amarka, the seminal sons of Sukracarya. These so-called
brahmanas then became angry at him. Because they were servants
of Hiranyaka$ipu, they were very sorry, and to chastise Prahlada
Maharaja they spoke as follows.
PURPORT
The word sukra means “semen.” The sons of Sukriacirya were
brahmanas by birthright, but an actual brahmana is one who possesses


--- Page 242 ---
238 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 5
the brahminical qualities. The brahmanas Sanda and Amarka, being
seminal sons of Sukricirya, did not actually possess real brahminical
qualifications, for they engaged as servants of Hiranyakasipu. An actual
brahmana is very much satisfied to see anyone, not to speak of his disci-
ple, become a devotee of Lord Krsna. Such br@ahmanas are meant to
satisfy the supreme master. A brahmana is strictly prohibited from be-
coming a servant of anyone else, for that is the business of dogs and
sadras. A dog must satisfy his master, but a brahmana does not have to
satisfy anyone; he is simply meant to satisfy Krsna (anukalyena
krsnanusilanam). That is the real qualification of a brahmana. Because
Sanda and Amarka were seminal brahmanas and had become servants of
such a master as Hiranyakasipu, they unnecessarily wanted to chastise
Prahlada Maharaja.

TRANSLATION

Oh, please bring me a stick! This Prahlada is damaging our
name and fame. Because of his bad intelligence, he has become
like a cinder in the dynasty of the demons. Now he needs to be
treated by the fourth of the four kinds of political diplomacy.

PURPORT

In political affairs, when a person disobediently agitates against the

government, four principles are used to suppress him —legal orders,


--- Page 243 ---
Text 17] Prahlada, the Saintly Son of Hiranyakasipu 239
pacification, the offer of a post, or, finally, weapons. When there are no
other arguments, he is punished. In logic, this is called argumentum ad
baculum. When the two seminal brahmanas Sanda and Amarka failed to
extract from Prahlada Maharaja the cause for his having opinions dif-
ferent from those of his father, they called for a stick with which to
chastise him to satisfy their master, Hiranyaka$ipu. Because Prahlada
had become a devotee, they considered him to be contaminated by bad
intelligence and to be the worst descendant in the family of demons. As it
is said, where ignorance is bliss, it is folly to be wise. In a society or
family in which everyone is a demon, for someone to become a Vaisnava
is certainly folly. Thus Prahlada Maharaja was charged with bad intelli-
gence because he was among demons, including his teachers, who were
supposedly brahmanas.

The members of our Krsna consciousness movement are in a position
similar to that of Prahlada Maharaja. All over the world, ninety-nine
percent of the people are godless demons, and therefore our preaching of
Krsna consciousness, following in the footsteps of Prahlada Maharaja, is
always hampered by many impediments. Because of their fault of being
devotees, the American boys who have sacrificed everything for preach-
ing Krsna consciousness are charged with being members of the CIA.
Moreover, the seminal brahmanas in India, who say that one can become
a brahmana only if born in a brahmana family, charge us with ruining
the Hindu system of religion. Of course, the fact is that one becomes a
brahmana by qualification. Because we are training Europeans and
Americans to become qualified and are awarding them brahminical
status, we are being charged with destroying the Hindu religion. None-
theless, confronting all kinds of difficulties, we must spread the Krsna
consciousness movement with great determination, like that of Prahlada
Maharaja. In spite of being the son of the demon Hiranyakasipu,
Prahlada never feared the chastisements of the seminal brahmana sons
of a demoniac father.

TRANSLATION

This rascal Prahlada has appeared like a thorn tree in a forest of
sandalwood. To cut down sandalwood trees, an axe is needed, and
the wood of the thorn tree is very suitable for the handle of such
an axe. Lord Visnu is the axe for cutting down the sandalwood
forest of the family of demons, and this Prahlada is the handle for
that axe.

PURPORT

Thorn trees generally grow in deserted places, not in sandalwood
forests, but the seminal brahmanas Sanda and Amarka compared the
dynasty of the Daitya HiranyakasSipu to a sandalwood forest and com-
pared Prahlada Maharaja to a hard, strong thorn tree that could provide
the handle of an axe. They compared Lord Visnu to the axe itself. An axe
alone cannot cut a thorn tree; it needs a handle, which may be made of
the wood of a thorn tree. Thus the thorn tree of demoniac civilization can
be cut to pieces by the axe of visnu-bhakti, devotional service to Lord
Krsna. Some of the members of the demoniac civilization, like Prahlada
Maharaja, may become the handle for the axe, to assist Lord Visnu, and
thus the entire forest of demoniac civilization can be cut to pieces.

TRANSLATION

Sanda and Amarka, the teachers of Prahlada Maharaja, chastised
and threatened their disciple in various ways and began teaching
him about the paths of religion, economic development and sense
gratification. This is the way they educated him.

PURPORT

In this verse the words prahradar grahayam asa are important. The
words grahayam dasa literally mean that they tried to induce Prahlada
Maharaja to accept the paths of dharma, artha and kama (religion,
economic development and sense gratification). People are generally
preoccupied with these three concerns, without interest in the path of
liberation. Hiranyakasipu, the father of Prahlada Maharaja, was simply
interested in gold and sense enjoyment. The word hiranya means
“gold,” and kaSipu refers to soft cushions and bedding on which people
enjoy sense gratification. The word prahlada, however, refers to one
who is always joyful in understanding Brahman (brahma-bhitah
prasannatma). Prahlada means prasannatma, always joyful. Prahlada
was always joyful in worshiping the Lord, but in accordance with the in-
structions of Hiranyaka$ipu, the teachers were interested in teaching
him about material things. Materialistic persons think that the path of
religion is meant for improving their material conditions. The materialist
goes to a temple to worship many varieties of demigods just to receive
some benediction to improve his material life. He goes to a sadhu or so-
called svami to take advantage of an easy method for achieving material
opulence. In the name of religion, the so-called sadhus try to satisfy the


--- Page 246 ---
242 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 5
senses of the materialists by showing them shortcuts to material opu-
lence. Sometimes they give some talisman or blessing. Sometimes they
attract materialistic persons by producing gold. Then they declare them-
selves God, and foolish materialists are attracted to them for economic
development. As a result of this process of cheating, others are reluctant
to accept a religious process, and instead they advise people in general to
work for material advancement. This is going on all over the world. Not
only now but since time immemorial, no one is interested in moksa,
liberation. There are four principles—dharma (religion), artha
(economic development), kama (sense gratification) and moksa (libera-
tion). People accept religion to become materially opulent. And why
should one be materially opulent? For sense gratification. Thus people
prefer these three margas, the three paths of materialistic life. No one is
interested in liberation, and bhagavad-bhakti, devotional service to the
Lord, is above even liberation. Therefore the process of devotional ser-
vice, Krsna consciousness, is extremely difficult to understand. This will
be explained later by Prahlada Maharaja. The teachers Sanda and
Amarka tried to induce Prahlada Maharaja to accept the materialistic way
of life, but actually their attempt was a failure.

TRANSLATION

After some time, the teachers Sanda and Amarka thought that
Prahlada Maharaja was sufficiently educated in the diplomatic
affairs of pacifying public leaders, appeasing them by giving them
lucrative posts, dividing and ruling over them, and punishing
them in cases of disobedience. Then, one day, after Prahlada’s
mother had personally washed the boy and dressed him nicely with
sufficient ornaments, they presented him before his father.

PURPORT

It is essential for a student who is going to be a ruler or king to learn
the four diplomatic principles. There is always rivalry between a king
and his citizens. Therefore, when a citizen agitates the public against the
king, the duty of the king is to call him and try to pacify him with sweet
words, saying, “You are very important in the state. Why should you dis-
turb the public with some new cause for agitation?”” If the citizen is not
pacified, the king should then offer him some lucrative post as a gover-
nor or minister—any post that draws a high salary —so that he may be
agreeable. If the enemy still goes on agitating the public, the king should
try to create dissension in the enemy’s camp, but if he still continues, the
king should employ argumentum ad baculum —severe punishment—by
putting him in jail or placing him before a firing squad. The teachers ap-
pointed by Hiranyakasipu taught Prahlada Maharaja how to be a
diplomat so that he could rule over the citizens very nicely.

PURPORT
In this verse, HiranyakaSipu inquires from his son what he has
learned from his guru. Prahlada Maharaja’s gurus were of two kinds—


--- Page 250 ---
246 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 5
Sanda and Amarka, the sons of Sukracarya in the seminal disciplic suc-
cession, were the gurus appointed by his father, but his other guru was
the exalted Narada Muni, who had instructed Prahlada when Prahlada
was within the womb of his mother. Prahlada Maharaja responded to the
inquiry of his father with the instructions he had received from his
spiritual master, Narada. Thus there was again a difference of opinion
because Prahlada Maharaja wanted to relate the best thing he had
learned from his spiritual master, whereas Hiranyakasipu expected to
hear about the politics and diplomacy Prahlada had learned from Sanda
and Amarka. Now the dissension between the father and son became in-
creasingly intense as Prahlada Maharaja began to say what he had
learned from his guru Narada Muni.

TRANSLATION

Prahlada Maharaja said: Hearing and chanting about the tran-
scendental holy name, form, qualities, paraphernalia and pastimes
of Lord Visnu, remembering them, serving the lotus feet of the
Lord, offering the Lord respectful worship with sixteen types of
paraphernalia, offering prayers to the Lord, becoming His servant,
considering the Lord one’s best friend, and surrendering every-
thing unto Him (in other words, serving Him with the body, mind
and words) —these nine processes are accepted as pure devotional
service. One who has dedicated his life to the service of Krsna
through these nine methods should be understood to be the most
learned person, for he has acquired complete knowledge.

PURPORT

When Prahlada Maharaja was asked by his father to say something
from whatever he had learned, he considered that what he had learned
from his spiritual master was the best of all teachings whereas what he
had learned about diplomacy from his material teachers, Sanda and
Amarka, was useless. Bhaktih paresanubhavo viraktir anyatra ca
(Bhag. 11.2.42). This is the symptom of pure devotional service. A pure
devotee is interested only in devotional service, not in material affairs.
To execute devotional service, one should always engage in hearing and
chanting about Krsna, or Lord Visnu. The process of temple worship is
called arcana. How to perform arcana will be explained herein. One
should have complete faith in the words of Krsna, who says that He is the
great well-wishing friend of everyone (suhrdarm sarva-bhitanam). A
devotee considers Krsna the only friend. This is called sakhyam.


--- Page 252 ---
248 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 5
Purisarpita visnau. The word puriisa means “by all living entities.”
There are no distinctions permitting only a man or only a brahmana to
offer devotional service to the Lord. Everyone can do so. As confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita (9.32), striyo vaisyas tatha sadrds te pi yanti param
gatim: although women, vaiSyas and Sidras are considered less intelli-
gent, they also can become devotees and return home, back to Godhead.

After performing sacrifices, sometimes a person engaged in fruitive
activity customarily offers the results to Visnu. But here it is said,
bhagavaty addha: one must directly offer everything to Visnu. This is
called sannydsa (not merely nydsa). A tridandi-sannyasi carries three
dandas, signifying kaya-mano-vakya—body, mind and words. All of
these should be offered to Visnu, and then one can begin devotional ser-
vice. Fruitive workers first perform some pious activities and then for-
mally or officially offer the results to Visnu. The real devotee, however,
first offers his surrender to Krsna with his body, mind and words and
then uses his body, mind and words for the service of Krsna as Krsna
desires.

Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura gives the following explana-
tion in his Tathya. The word Sravana refers to giving aural reception to
the holy name and descriptions of the Lord’s form, qualities, entourage
and pastimes as explained in Srimad-Bhagavatam, Bhagavad-gita and
similar authorized scriptures. After aurally receiving such messages, one
should memorize these vibrations and repeat them (kirtanam).
Smaranam means trying to understand more and more about the
Supreme Lord, and pada-sevanam means engaging oneself in serving
the lotus feet of the Lord according to the time and circumstances.
Arcanam means worshiping Lord Visnu as one does in the temple, and
vandanam means offering respectful obeisances. Man-mana bhava
mad-bhakto mad-yaji mam namaskuru. Vandanam means
namaskuru—offering obeisances or offering prayers. Thinking oneself
to be nitya-krsna-dasa, everlastingly a servant of Krsna, is called
dasyam, and sakhyam means being a well-wisher of Krsna. Krsna wants
everyone to surrender unto Him because everyone is constitutionally His
servant. Therefore, as a sincere friend of Krsna, one should preach this
philosophy, requesting everyone to surrender unto Krsna. Atma-
nivedanam means offering Krsna everything, including one’s body,
mind, intelligence and whatever one may possess.

Text 24] Prahlada, the Saintly Son of Hiranyakasipu 249
One’s sincere endeavor to perform these nine processes of devotional
service is technically called bhakti. The word addha means “directly.”
One should not be like the karmis, who perform pious activities and then
formally offer the results to Krsna. That is karma-kanda. One should not
aspire for the results of his pious activities, but should dedicate oneself
fully and then act piously. In other words, one should act for the satisfac-
tion of Lord Visnu, not for the satisfaction of his own senses. That is the
meaning of the word addha, “directly.”
anyabhilasita-sanyamn

“One should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord
Krsna favorably and without desire for material profit or gain through
fruitive activities or philosophical speculation. That is called pure devo-
tional service.” One should simply satisfy Krsna, without being in-
fluenced by fruitive knowledge or fruitive activity.

The Gopala-tapant Upanisad says that the word bhakti means engage-
ment in the devotional service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
not of anyone else. This Upanisad describes that bhakti is the offering of
devotional service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. To perform
devotional service, one should be relieved of the bodily conception of life
and aspirations to be happy through elevation to the higher planetary
systems. In other words, work performed simply for the satisfaction of
the Supreme Lord, without any desire for material benefits, is called
bhakti. Bhakti is also called niskarma, or freedom from the results of
fruitive activity. Bhakti and niskarma are on the same platform, al-
though devotional service and fruitive activity appear almost the same.

The nine different processes enunciated by Prahlada Maharaja, who
learned them from Narada Muni, may not all be required for the execu-
tion of devotional service; if a devotee performs only one of these nine
without deviation, he can attain the mercy of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Sometimes it is found that when one performs one of the
processes, other processes are mixed with it. That is not improper for a
devotee. When a devotee executes any one of the nine processes (nava-


--- Page 254 ---
250 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 5
laksand), this is sufficient; the other eight processes are included. Now
let us discuss these nine different processes.

(1) Sravanam. Hearing of the holy name of the Lord (sravanam) is
the beginning of devotional service. Although any one of the nine pro-
cesses is sufficient, in chronological order the hearing of the holy name of
the Lord is the beginning. Indeed, it is essential. As enunciated by Lord
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, ceto-darpana-marjanam: by chanting the
holy name of the Lord, one is cleansed of the material conception of life,
which is due to the dirty modes of material nature. When the dirt is
cleansed from the core of one’s heart, one can realize the form of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead —iSvarah paramah krsnah sac-cid-
ananda-vigrahah. Thus by hearing the holy name of the Lord, one
comes to the platform of understanding the personal form of the Lord.
After realizing the Lord’s form, one can realize the transcendental
qualities of the Lord, and when one can understand His transcendental
qualities one can understand the Lord’s associates. In this way a devotee
advances further and further toward complete understanding of the
Lord as he awakens in realization of the Lord’s holy name, transcenden-
tal form and qualities, His paraphernalia, and everything pertaining to
Him. Therefore the chronological process is sravanam kirtanam visnoh.
This same process of chronological understanding holds true in chanting
and remembering. When the chanting of the holy name, form, qualities
and paraphernalia is heard from the mouth of a pure devotee, his hear-
ing and chanting are very pleasing. Srila Sanatana Gosvami has forbid-
den us to hear the chanting of an artificial devotee or nondevotee.

Hearing from the text of Srimad-Bhagavatam is considered the most
important process of hearing. Srimad-Bhagavatam is full of transcen-
dental chanting of the holy name, and therefore the chanting and hear-
ing of Srimad-Bhagavatam are transcendentally full of mellows. The
transcendental holy name of the Lord may be heard and chanted accor-
dingly to the attraction of the devotee. One may chant the holy name of
Lord Krsna, or one may chant the holy name of Lord Rama or
Nrsithhadeva (ramadi-mirtisu kald-niyamena tisthan). The Lord has
innumerable forms and names, and devotees may meditate upon a par-
ticular form and chant the holy name according to his attraction. The
best course is to hear of the holy name, form and so on from a pure devo-
tee of the same standard as oneself. In other words, one who is attached


--- Page 255 ---
Text 24] Prahlada, the Saintly Son of HiranyakasSipu 251
to Krsna should chant and hear from other pure devotees who are also at-
tached to Lord Krsna. The same principle applies for devotees attracted
by Lord Rama, Lord Nrsimmha and other forms of the Lord. Because
Krsna is the ultimate form of the Lord (krsnas tu bhagavan svayam), it
is best to hear about Lord Krsna’s name, form and pastimes from a
realized devotee who is particularly attracted by the form of Lord Krsna.
In Srimad-Bhagavatam, great devotees like Sukadeva Gosvami have
specifically described Lord Krsna’s holy name, form and qualities. Unless
one hears about the holy name, form and qualities of the Lord, one can-
not clearly understand the other processes of devotional service.
Therefore Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu recommends that one chant the holy
name of Krsna. Param vijayate sri-krsna-sainkirtanam. If one 15 fortu-
nate enough to hear from the mouth of realized devotees, he is very
easily successful on the path of devotional service. Therefore hearing of
the holy name, form and qualities of the Lord is essential.

In Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.5.11) there is this verse:

tad-vag-visargo janatagha-viplavo
yasmin prati-§lokam abaddhavaty api
namany anantasya yaso- nkitani yat
Srnvanti gayanti grnanti sadhavah

“Verses describing the name, form and qualities of Anantadeva, the un-
limited Supreme Lord, are able to vanquish all the sinful reactions of the
entire world. Therefore even if such verses are improperly composed,
devotees hear them, describe them and accept them as bona fide and
authorized.” In this connection, Sridhara Svami has remarked that a
pure devotee takes advantage of another pure devotee by trying to hear
from him about the holy name, form and qualities of the Lord. If there is
no such opportunity, he alone chants and hears the Lord’s holy name.

(2) Kirtanam. The hearing of the holy name has been described
above. Now let us try to understand the chanting of the holy name, which
is the second item in the consecutive order. It is recommended that such
chanting be performed very loudly. In Srimad-Bhagavatam, Narada
Muni says that without shame he began traveling all over the world,
chanting the holy name of the Lord. Similarly, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu
has advised:


--- Page 256 ---
252 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 5
trnad api sunicena
taror api sahisnuna
amanina manadena
kirtaniyah sada harih

A devotee can very peacefully chant the holy name of the Lord by behav-
ing more humbly than the grass, being tolerant like a tree and offering
respects to everyone, without expecting honor from anyone else. Such
qualifications make it easier to chant the holy name of the Lord. The pro-
cess of transcendental chanting can be easily performed by anyone. Even
if one is physically unfit, classified lower than others, devoid of material
qualifications or not at all elevated in terms of pious activities, the chant-
ing of the holy name is beneficial. An aristocratic birth, an advanced
education, beautiful bodily features, wealth and similar results of pious
activities are all unnecessary for advancement in spiritual life, for one
can very easily advance simply by chanting the holy name. It is under-
stood from the authoritative source of Vedic literature that especially in
this age, Kali-yuga, people are generally short-living, extremely bad in
their habits, and inclined to accept methods of devotional service that are
not bona fide. Moreover, they are always disturbed by material condi-
tions, and they are mostly unfortunate. Under the circumstances, the
performance of other processes, such as yajiia, dana, tapah and kriya—
sacrifices, charity and so on—are not at all possible. Therefore it is
recommended:

harer nama harer nama

harer namaiva kevalam
kalau nasty eva nasty eva
nasty eva gatir anyatha

“In this age of quarrel and hypocrisy the only means of deliverance is
chanting of the holy name of the Lord. There is no other way. There is no
other way. There is no other way.” Simply by chanting the holy name of
the Lord, one advances perfectly in spiritual life. This is the best process
for success in life. In other ages, the chanting of the holy name is equally
powerful, but especially in this age, Kali-yuga, it is most powerful.
Kirtanad eva krsnasya mukta-sangah param vrajet: simply by chanting


--- Page 257 ---
Text 24] Prahlada, the Saintly Son of Hiranyakasipu 253
the holy name of Krsna, one is liberated and returns home, back to
Godhead. Therefore, even if one is able to perform other processes of
devotional service, one must adopt the chanting of the holy name as the
principal method of advancing in spiritual life. Yajiiaih sarikirtana-
prayair yajanti hi sumedhasah: those who are very sharp in their intelli-
gence should adopt this process of chanting the holy names of the Lord.
One should not, however, manufacture different types of chanting. One
should adhere seriously to the chanting of the holy name as recom-
mended in the scriptures: Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare
Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rima Rama, Hare Hare.

While chanting the holy name of the Lord, one should be careful to
avoid ten offenses. From Sanat-kumara it is understood that even if a
person is a severe offender in many ways, he is freed from offensive life
if he takes shelter of the Lord’s holy name. Indeed, even if a human
being is no better than a two-legged animal, he will be liberated if he
takes shelter of the holy name of the Lord. One should therefore be very
careful not to commit offenses at the lotus feet of the Lord’s holy name.
The offenses are described as follows: (a) to blaspheme a devotee, es-
pecially a devotee engaged in broadcasting the glories of the holy name,
(b) to consider the name of Lord Siva or any other demigod to be equally
as powerful as the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (no
one is equal to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, nor is anyone
superior to Him), (0) to disobey the instructions of the spiritual master,
(d) to blaspheme the Vedic literatures and literatures compiled in pur-
suance of the Vedic literatures, (९) to comment that the glories of the
holy name of the Lord are exaggerated, (f) to interpret the holy name in
a deviant way, (8) to commit sinful activities on the strength of chanting
the holy name, (h) to compare the chanting of the holy name to pious ac-
tivities, (i) to instruct the glories of the holy name to a person who has
no understanding of the chanting of the holy name, (7) not to awaken in
transcendental attachment for the chanting of the holy name, even after
hearing all these scriptural injunctions.

There is no way to atone for any of these offenses. It is therefore
recommended that an offender at the feet of the holy name continue to
chant the holy name twenty-four hours a day. Constant chanting of the
holy name will make one free of offenses, and then he will gradually be
elevated to the transcendental platform on which he can chant the pure


--- Page 258 ---
254 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 5
holy name and thus become a lover of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead.

It is recommended that even if one commits offenses, one should con-
tinue chanting the holy name. In other words, the chanting of the holy
name makes one offenseless. In the book Nama-kaumudi it is recom-
mended that if one is an offender at the lotus feet of a Vaisnava, he
should submit to that Vaisnava and be excused; similarly, if one is an
offender in chanting the holy name, he should submit to the holy name
and thus be freed from his offenses. In this connection there is the
following statement, spoken by Daksa to Lord Siva: “I did not know the
glories of your personality, and therefore I committed an offense at your
lotus feet in the open assembly. You are so kind, however, that you did
not accept my offense. Instead, when I was falling down because of ac-
cusing you, you saved me by your merciful glance. You are most great.
Kindly excuse me and be satisfied with your own exalted qualities.”

One should be very humble and meek to offer one’s desires and chant
prayers composed in glorification of the holy name, such as ayi mukta-
kulair updsya manam and nivrtta-tarsair upagiyamanad. One should
chant such prayers to become free from offenses at the lotus feet of the
holy name.

(3) Smaranam. After one regularly performs the processes of hearing
and chanting and after the core of one’s heart is cleansed, smaranam,
remembering, is recommended. In Srimad-Bhagavatam (2.1.11)
Sukadeva Gosvami tells King Pariksit:

etan nirvidyamananam
icchatam akuto-bhayam
yoginam nrpa nirnitam
harer namanukirtanam
“0 King, for great yogis who have completely renounced all material
connections, for those who desire all material enjoyment and for those
who are self-satisfied by dint of transcendental knowledge, constant
chanting of the holy name of the Lord is recommended.” According to
different relationships with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there
are varieties of namanukirtanam, chanting of the holy name, and thus
according to different relationships and mellows there are five kinds of


--- Page 259 ---
Text 24] Prahlada, the Saintly Son of Hiranyakasipu 255
remembering. These are as follows: (a) conducting research into the
worship of a particular form of the Lord, (b) concentrating the mind on
one subject and withdrawing the mind’s activities of thinking, feeling
and willing from all other subjects, (0) concentrating upon a particular
form of the Lord (this is called meditation), (d) concentrating one’s
mind continuously on the form of the Lord (this is called dhruvanusmrti,
or perfect meditation), and (e) awakening a likening for concentration
upon a particular form (this is called samadhi, or trance). Mental con-
centration upon particular pastimes of the Lord in particular circum-
stances is also called remembrance. Therefore samadhi, trance, can be
possible in five different ways in terms of one’s relationship. Specifically,
the trance of devotees on the stage of neutrality is called mental
concentration.

(4) Pada-sevanam. According to one’s taste and strength, hearing,
chanting and remembrance may be followed by pada-sevanam. One ob-
tains the perfection of remembering when one constantly thinks of the
lotus feet of the Lord. Being intensely attached to thinking of the Lord’s
lotus feet is called pada-sevanam. When one is particularly adherent to
the process of pada-sevanam, this process gradually includes other pro-
cesses, such as seeing the form of the Lord, touching the form of the
Lord, circumambulating the form or temple of the Lord, visiting such
places as Jagannatha Puri, Dvaraka and Mathura to see the Lord’s form,
and bathing in the Ganges or Yamuna. Bathing in the Ganges and serving
a pure Vaisnava are also known as tadtya-upasanam. This is also pada-
sevanam. The word tadiya means “in relationship with the Lord.” Ser-
vice to the Vaisnava, Tulasi, Ganges and Yamuna are included in pdda-
sevanam. All these processes of pada-sevanam help one advance in
spiritual life very quickly.

(5) Arcanam. After pada-sevanam comes the process of arcanam,
worship of the Deity. If one is interested in the process of arcanam, one
must positively take shelter of a bona fide spiritual master and learn the
process from him. There are many books for arcana, especially Narada-
paiicaratra. In this age, the Paiicaratra system is particularly recom-
mended for arcana, Deity worship. There are two systems of arcana —
the bhagavata system and pancaratriki system. In the Srimad-
Bhagavatam there is no recommendation of pdarcaratriki worship be-
cause in this Kali-yuga, even without Deity worship, everything can be


--- Page 260 ---
256 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 5
perfectly performed simply through hearing, chanting, remembering
and worship of the lotus feet of the Lord. Ripa Gosvami states:

Sri-visnoh Sravane pariksid abhavad vaiyasakih kirtane

prahladah smarane tad-arnghri-bhajane laksmih prthuh pajane

akriras tv abhivandane kapi-patir dasye ‘tha sakhye ’rjunah

sarvasvatma-nivedane balir abhit krsnaptir esam param
“Pariksit Maharaja attained salvation simply by hearing, and Sukadeva
Gosvami attained salvation simply by chanting. Prahlada Maharaja at-
tained salvation by remembering the Lord. The goddess of fortune,
Laksmidevi, attained perfection by worshiping the Lord’s lotus feet.
Prthu Maharaja attained salvation by worshiping the Deity of the Lord.
Akrira attained salvation by offering prayers, Hanuman by rendering
service, Arjuna by establishing friendship with the Lord, and Bali
Maharaja by offering everything to the service of the Lord.” All these
great devotees served the Lord according to a particular process, but
every one of them attained salvation and became eligible to return home,
back to Godhead. This is explained in Srimad-Bhagavatam.

It is therefore recommended that initiated devotees follow the
principles of Narada-paficaratra by worshiping the Deity in the temple.
Especially for householder devotees who are opulent in material posses-
sions, the path of Deity worship is strongly recommended. An opulent
householder devotee who does not engage his hard-earned money in the
service of the Lord is called a miser. One should not engage paid
brahmanas to worship the Deity. If one does not personally worship the
Deity but engages paid servants instead, he is considered lazy, and his
worship of the Deity is called artificial. An opulent householder can col-
lect luxurious paraphernalia for Deity worship, and consequently for
householder devotees the worship of the Deity is compulsory. In our
Krsna consciousness movement there are brahmacaris, grhasthas,
vanaprasthas and sannyasis, but the Deity worship in the temple should
be performed especially by the householders. The brahmacaris can go
with the sannyasis to preach, and the vanaprasthas should prepare
themselves for the next status of renounced life, sannyasa. Grhastha de-
votees, however, are generally engaged in material activities, and
therefore if they do not take to Deity worship, their falling down is


--- Page 261 ---
Text 24] Prahlada, the Saintly Son of Hiranyakasipu 257
positively assured. Deity worship means following the rules and regula-
tions precisely. That will keep one steady in devotional service. Generally
householders have children, and then the wives of the householders
should be engaged in caring for the children, just as women acting as
teachers care for the children in a nursery school.

Grhastha devotees must adopt the arcana-vidhi, or Deity worship ac-
cording to the suitable arrangements and directions given by the
spiritual master. Regarding those unable to take to the Deity worship in
the temple, there is the following statement in the Agni Purana. Any
householder devotee circumstantially unable to worship the Deity must
at least see the Deity worship, and in this way he may achieve success
also. The special purpose of Deity worship is to keep oneself always pure
and clean. Grhastha devotees should be actual examples of cleanliness.

Deity worship should be continued along with hearing and chanting.
Therefore every mantra is preceded by the word namah. In all the
mantras there are specific potencies, of which the grhastha devotees
must take advantage. There are many mantras preceded by the word
namah, but if one chants the holy name of the Lord, he receives the
result of chanting namah many times. By chanting the holy name of the
Lord, one can reach the platform of love of Godhead. One might ask,
then what is the necessity of being initiated? The answer is that even
though the chanting of the holy name is sufficient to enable one to
progress in spiritual life to the standard of love of Godhead, one is none-
theless susceptible to contamination because of possessing a material
body. Consequently, special stress is given to the arcana-vidhi. One
should therefore regularly take advantage of both the bhdgavata process
and pancaratriki process.

Deity worship has two divisions, namely pure and mixed with fruitive
activities. For one who is steady, Deity worship is compulsory. Observing
the various types of festivals, such as Sri Janmdstami, Rama-navami
and Nrsirmha-caturdas, is also included in the process of Deity worship.
In other words, it is compulsory for householder devotees to observe
these festivals.

Now let us discuss the offenses in Deity worship. The following are
offenses: (a) to enter the temple with shoes or being carried on a palan-
quin, (¢) not to observe the prescribed festivals, (0) to avoid offering
obeisances in front of the Deity, (d) to offer prayers in an unclean state,


--- Page 262 ---
258 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 5
not having washed one’s hands after eating, (९) to offer obeisances with
one hand, 0 to circumambulate directly in front of the Deity, ও) 10
spread one’s legs before the Deity, (7) 10 sit before the Deity while hold-
ing one’s ankles with one’s hands, (i) to lie down before the Deity, 0 to
eat before the Deity, (049 to speak lies before the Deity, (¢ to address
someone loudly before the Deity, (m) to talk nonsense before the Deity,
(rn) to cry before the Deity, (0) to argue before the Deity, (p) to chastise
someone before the Deity, (৫) to show someone favor before the Deity,
(r) to use harsh words before the Deity, (s) to wear a woolen blanket
before the Deity, (2) to blaspheme someone before the Deity, (u) to wor-
ship someone else before the Deity, (v) to use vulgar language before
the Deity, (w) to pass air before the Deity, (x) to avoid very opulent
worship of the Deity, even though one is able to perform it, (y) to eat
something not offered to the Deity, (2) to avoid offering fresh fruits to
the Deity according to the season, (aa) to offer food to the Deity which
has already been used or from which has first been given to others (in
other words, food should not be distributed to anyone else until it has
been offered to the Deity), (bb) to sit with one’s back toward the Deity,
(cc) to offer obeisances to someone else in front of the Deity, (dd) not to
chant proper prayers when offering obeisances to the spiritual master,
(ee) to praise oneself before the Deity, and (ff) to blaspheme the
demigods. In the worship of the Deity, these thirty-two offenses should
be avoided.

In the Varaha Purana the following offenses are mentioned: (a) to
eat in the house of a rich man, (b) to enter the Deity’s room in the dark,
(c) to worship the Deity without following the regulative principles,
(0) to enter the temple without vibrating any sound, (6) to collect food
that has been seen by a dog, (f) to break silence while offering worship
to the Deity, (g) to go to the toilet during the time of worshiping the
Deity, (h) to offer incense without offering flowers, (i) to worship the
Deity with forbidden flowers, (j) to begin worship without having
washed one’s teeth, (k) to begin worship after sex, (I) to touch a lamp,
dead body or a woman during her menstrual period, or to put on red or
bluish clothing, unwashed clothing, the clothing of others or soiled
clothing. Other offenses are to worship the Deity after seeing a dead
body, to pass air before the Deity, to show anger before the Deity, and to
worship the Deity just after returning from a crematorium. After eating,


--- Page 263 ---
Text 24] Prahlada, the Saintly Son of HiranyakaSipu 259
one should not worship the Deity until one has digested his food, nor
should one touch the Deity or engage in any Deity worship after eating
safflower oil or hing. These are also offenses.

In other places, the following offenses are listed: (a) to be against the
scriptural injunctions of the Vedic literature or to disrespect within one’s
heart the Srimad-Bhagavatam while externally falsely accepting its
principles, (8) to introduce differing $astras, (0) to chew pan and betel
before the Deity, (d) to keep flowers for worship on the leaf of a castor
oil plant, (९) to worship the Deity in the afternoon, (f) tosit on the altar
or to sit on the floor to worship the Deity (without a seat), (g) to touch
the Deity with the left hand while bathing the Deity, (h) to worship the
Deity with a stale or used flower, (i) to spit while worshiping the Deity,
@) to advertise one’s glory while worshiping the Deity, (k) to apply
tilaka to one’s forehead in a curved way, (I) to enter the temple without
having washed one’s feet, (m) to offer the Deity food cooked by an
uninitiated person, (n) to worship the Deity and offer bhoga to the Deity
within the vision of an uninitiated person or non-Vaisnava, (0) to offer
worship to the Deity without worshiping Vaikuntha deities like Ganesa,
(p) to worship the Deity while perspiring, (0) to refuse flowers offered
to the Deity, (7) to take a vow or oath in the holy name of the Lord.

If one commits any of the above offenses, one must read at least one
chapter of Bhagavad-gita. This is confirmed in the Shanda-Purana,
Avanti-khanda. Similarly, there is another injunction, stating that one
who reads the thousand names of Visnu can be released from all
offenses. In the same Skanda-Purana, Reva-khanda, it is said that one
who recites prayers to tulasi or sows a tulasi seed is also freed from all
offenses. Similarly, one who worships the $alagrama-sila can also be
relieved of offenses. In the Brahmanda Purana it is said that one who
worships Lord Visnu, whose four hands bear a conchshell, disc, lotus
flower and club, can be relieved from the above offenses. In the Adi-
varaha Purana it is said that a worshiper who has committed offenses
may fast for one day at the holy place known as Saukarava and then
bathe in the Ganges.

In the process of worshiping the Deity it is sometimes enjoined that
one worship the Deity within the mind. In the Padma Purana, Uttara-
khanda, it is said, “All persons can generally worship within the mind.”
The Gautamiya Tantra states, “For a sannydsi who has no home,


--- Page 264 ---
260 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 5
worship of the Deity within the mind is recommended.” In the Narada-
paricardtra it is stated by Lord Narayana that worship of the Deity within
the mind is called manasa-pija. One can become free from the four mis-
eries by this method. Sometimes worship from the mind can be indepen-
dently executed. According to the instruction of Avirhotra Muni, one of
the nava-yogendras, as mentioned in Srimad-Bhagavatam, one may
worship the Deity by chanting all the mantras. Eight kinds of Deities are
mentioned in the $astra, and the mental Deity is one of them. In this
regard, the following description is given in the Brahma-vaivarta
Purana.

In the city of Pratisthiana-pura, long ago, there resided a brahmana
who was poverty-stricken but innocent and not dissatisfied. One day he
heard a discourse in an assembly of brahmanas concerning how to wor-
ship the Deity in the temple. In that meeting, he also heard that the Deity
may be worshiped within the mind. After this incident, the brahmana,
having bathed in the Godavari River, began mentally worshiping the
Deity. He would wash the temple within his mind, and then in his
imagination he would bring water from all the sacred rivers in golden
and silver waterpots. He collected all kinds of valuable paraphernalia for -
worship, and he worshiped the Deity very gorgeously, beginning from
bathing the Deity and ending with offering arati. Thus he felt great hap-
piness. After many years had passed in this way, one day within his mind
he cooked nice sweet rice with ghee to worship the Deity. He placed the
sweet rice on a golden dish and offered it to Lord Krsna, but he felt that
the sweet rice was very hot, and therefore he touched it with his finger.
He immediately felt that his finger had been burned by the hot sweet
rice, and thus he began to lament. While the brahmana was in pain, Lord
Visnu in Vaikuntha began smiling, and the goddess of fortune inquired
from the Lord why He was smiling. Lord Visnu then ordered His asso-
ciates to bring the brahmana to Vaikuntha. Thus the brahmana attained
the liberation of samipya, the facility of living near the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead.

(6) Vandanam. Although prayers are a part of Deity worship, they
may be considered separately like the other items, such as hearing and
chanting, and therefore separate statements are given herewith. The
Lord has unlimited transcendental qualities and opulences, and one who
feels influenced by the Lord’s qualities in various activities offers


--- Page 265 ---
Text 24] Prahlada, the Saintly Son of Hiranyakasipu 261
prayers to the Lord. In this way he becomes successful. In this connec-
tion, the following are some of the offenses to be avoided: (a) to offer
obeisances on one hand, (b) to offer obeisances with one’s body covered,
(0) to show one’s back to the Deity, (d) to offer obeisances on the left
side of the Deity, (€) to offer obeisances very near the Deity.

(7) Dasyam. There is the following statement in regard to assisting
the Lord as a servant. After many, many thousands of births, when one
comes to understand that he is an eternal servant of Krsna, one can
deliver others from this universe. If one simply continues to think that
he is an eternal servant of Krsna, even without performing any other
process of devotional service, he can attain full success, for simply by
this feeling one can perform all nine processes of devotional service.

(8) Sakhyam. In regard to worshiping the Lord as a friend, the
Agastya-samhita states that a devotee engaged in performing devotional
service by Sravanam and kirtanam sometimes wants to see the Lord per-
sonally, and for this purpose he resides in the temple. Elsewhere there is
this statement: “0 my Lord, Supreme Personality and eternal friend, al-
though You are full of bliss and knowledge, You have become the friend
of the residents of Vrndavana. How fortunate are these devotees!” In
this statement the word “friend” is specifically used to indicate intense
love. Friendship, therefore, is better than servitude. In the stage above
dasya-rasa, the devotee accepts the Supreme Personality of Godhead as a
friend. This is not at all astonishing, for when a devotee is pure in heart
the opulence of his worship of the Deity diminishes as spontaneous love
for the Personality of Godhead is manifested. In this regard, Sridhara
Svami mentions Sridama Vipra, who expressed to himself his feelings of
obligation, thinking, “Life after life, may I be connected with Krsna in
this friendly attitude.”

(9) Atma-nivedanam. The word atma-nivedanam refers to the stage
at which one who has no motive other than to serve the Lord surrenders
everything to the Lord and performs his activities only to please the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such a devotee is like a cow that is
cared for by its master. When cared for by its master, a cow is not in
anxiety over its maintenance. Such a cow is always devoted to its master,
and it never acts independently, but only for the master’s benefit. Some
devotees, therefore, consider dedication of the body to the Lord to be
atma-nivedanam, and as stated in the book known as Bhakti-viveka,


--- Page 266 ---
262 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 5
sometimes dedication of the soul to the Lord is called atma-nivedanam.
The best examples of atma-nivedanam are found in Bali Maharaja and
Ambarisa Maharaja. Atma-nivedanam is also sometimes found in the
behavior of Rukminidevi at Dvaraka.

PURPORT
In this verse the word asaram, meaning, ‘having no substance,” is
significant. For a demon there is no substance in the process of devo-
tional service, but to a devotee devotional service is the only essential
factor in life. Since Hiranyakasipu did not like devotional service, the
essence of life, he chastised Prahlada Maharaja’s teachers with harsh
words.

deceptive friends in false garbs, but eventually, because of their
false behavior, their actual enmity becomes manifest.
PURPORT
Being anxious about the education of his boy Prahlada, Hiranyakasipu
was very much dissatisfied. When Prahlada began teaching about devo-
tional service, Hiranyakasipu immediately regarded the teachers as his
enemies in the garb of friends. In this verse the words rogah patakinam
2८ refer to disease, which is the most sinful and miserable of the condi-
tions of material life (janma-mrtyu-jara-vyadhi). Disease is the
symptom of the body of a sinful person. The smrti-sastras say,

superior are afflicted by leprosy and similar skin diseases.

you gotten it?
PURPORT
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura explains that devotional service
is actually bhadra sati, not abhadra asati. In other words, knowledge of
devotional service can be neither inauspicious nor contrary to etiquette.
To learn devotional service is the duty of everyone. Therefore the spon-
taneous education of Prahlada Maharaja is supported as auspicious and
perfect.

TRANSLATION

Prahlada Maharaja replied: Because of their uncontrolled
senses, persons too addicted to materialistic life make progress
toward hellish conditions and repeatedly chew that which has
already been chewed. Their inclinations toward Krsna are never
aroused, either by the instructions of others, by their own efforts,
or by a combination of both.

PURPORT

In this verse the words matir na krsne refer to devotional service ren-
dered to Krsna. So-called politicians, erudite scholars and philosophers
who read Bhagavad-gita try to twist some meaning from it to suit their
material purposes, but their misunderstandings of Krsna will not yield
them any profit. Because such politicians, philosophers and scholars are
interested in using Bhagavad-gita as a vehicle for adjusting things ma-
terially, for them constant thought of Krsna, or Krsna consciousness, is
impossible (matir na krsne). As stated in Bhagavad-gita (18.55),
bhaktya mam abhijanati: only through devotional service can one
understand Krsna as He is. The so-called politicians and scholars think of
Krsna as fictitious. The politician says that his Krsna is different from
the Krsna depicted in Bhagavad-gita. Even though he accepts Krsna and
Rama as the Supreme he thinks of Rama and Krsna as impersonal be-
cause he has no idea of service to Krsna. Thus his only business is punah
punas carvita-carvananam—chewing the chewed again and again. The
aim of such politicians and academic scholars is to enjoy this material
world with their bodily senses. Therefore it is clearly stated here that
those who are grha-vrata, whose only aim is to live comfortably with the
body in the material world, cannot understand Krsna. The two expres-
sions grha-vrata and carvita-carvananam indicate that a materialistic
person tries to enjoy sense gratification in different bodily forms, life
after life, but is still unsatisfied. In the name of personalism, this ism or
that ism, such persons always remain attached to the materialistic way of
life. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (2.44):

bhogaisvarya-prasaktanam
tayapahrta-cetasam


--- Page 272 ---
268 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 5
vyavasayatmika buddhih
samadhau na vidhiyate
“In the minds of those who are too attached to sense enjoyment and ma-
terial opulence, and who are bewildered by such things, the resolute
determination for devotional service to the Supreme Lord does not take
place.” Those who are attached to material enjoyment cannot be fixed in
devotional service to the Lord. They cannot understand Bhagavan,
Krsna, or His instruction, Bhagavad-gita. Adanta-gobhir visatarh
tamisram: their path actually leads toward hellish life.

As confirmed by Rsabhadeva, mahat-sevarih dvaram ahur vimukteh:
one must try to understand Krsna by serving a devotee. The word mahat
refers to a devotee.

mahatmanas tu mar partha
daivirh prakrtim asritah
bhajanty ananya-manaso
jiatva bhitadim avyayam

““O son of Prtha, those who are not deluded, the great souls, are under
the protection of the divine nature. They are fully engaged in devotional
service because they know Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
original and inexhaustible.” (Bg. 9.13) A mahatma is one who is
constantly engaged in devotional service, twenty-four hours a day. As
explained in the following verses, unless one adheres to such a great per-
sonality, one cannot understand Krsna. HiranyakasSipu wanted to know
where Prahlada had gotten this Krsna consciousness. Who had taught
him? Prahlada sarcastically replied, “My dear father, persons like you
never understand Krsna. One can understand Krsna only by serving a
mahat, a great soul. Those who try to adjust material conditions are said
to be chewing the chewed. No one has been able to adjust material condi-
tions, but life after life, generation after generation, people try and
repeatedly fail. Unless one is properly trained by a mahat—a mahatma,
or unalloyed devotee of the Lord —there is no possibility of one’s under-
standing Krsna and His devotional service.”

Persons who are strongly entrapped by the consciousness of en-
joying material life, and who have therefore accepted as their
leader or guru a similar blind man attached to external sense ob-
jects, cannot understand that the goal of life is to return home,
back to Godhead, and engage in the service of Lord Visnu. As
blind men guided by another blind man miss the right path and
fall into a ditch, materially attached men led by another materially
attached man are bound by the ropes of fruitive labor, which are
made of very strong cords, and they continue again and again in
materialistic life, suffering the threefold miseries.
PURPORT
Since there must always be a difference of opinion between demons
and devotees, Hiranyakaéipu, when criticized by his son Prahlada


--- Page 274 ---
270 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 5
Maharaja, should not have been surprised that Prahlada Maharaja dif-
fered from his way of life. Nonetheless, HiranyakaSipu was extremely
angry and wanted to rebuke his son for deriding his teacher or spiritual
master, who had been born in the brahmana family of the great acarya
Sukracarya. The word Sukra means ‘“‘semen,” and acarya refers to a
teacher or guru. Hereditary gurus, or spiritual masters, have been ac-
cepted everywhere since time immemorial, but Prahlada Maharaja
declined to accept such a seminal guru or take instruction from him. An
actual guru is Srotriya, one who has heard or received perfect knowledge
through parampara, the disciplic succession. Therefore Prahlada
Maharaja did not recognize a seminal spiritual master. Such spiritual
masters are not at all interested in Visnu. Indeed, they are hopeful of
material success (bahir-artha-maninah). The word bahih means
“external,” artha means “interest,” and manina means “taking very
seriously.” Generally speaking, practically everyone is unaware of the
spiritual world. The knowledge of the materialists is restricted within the
four-billion-mile limit of this material world, which is in the dark por-
tion of the creation; they do not know that beyond the material world is
the spiritual world. Unless one is a devotee of the Lord, one cannot
understand the existence of the spiritual world. Gurus, teachers, who are
simply interested in this material world are described in this verse as
andha, blind. Such blind men may lead many other blind followers with-
out true knowledge of material conditions, but they are not accepted by
devotees like Prahlada Maharaja. Such blind teachers, being interested in
the external, material world, are always bound by the strong ropes of
material nature.

TRANSLATION

Unless they smear upon their bodies the dust of the lotus feet of
a Vaisnava completely freed from material contamination, persons
very much inclined toward materialistic life cannot be attached to
the lotus feet of the Lord, who is glorified for His uncommon ac-
tivities. Only by becoming Krsna conscious and taking shelter at
the lotus feet of the Lord in this way can one be freed from ma-
terial contamination.

PURPORT

Becoming Krsna conscious brings about anartha-apagamah, the
disappearance of all anarthas, the miserable conditions we have unneces-
sarily accepted. The material body is the basic principle of these un-
wanted miserable conditions. The entire Vedic civilization is meant to
relieve one from these unwanted miseries, but persons bound by the laws
of nature do not know the destination of life. As described in the pre-
vious verse, iSa-tantryam uru-damni baddhah: they are conditioned by
the three strong modes of material nature. The education that keeps the
conditioned soul bound life after life is called materialistic education.
Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura has explained that materialistic education
expands the influence of maya. Such an education induces the condi-
tioned soul to be increasingly attracted to materialistic life and to stray
further and further away from liberation from unwanted miseries.


--- Page 276 ---
272 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 5

One may ask why highly educated persons do not take to Krsna con-
sciousness. The reason is explained in this verse. Unless one takes shelter
of a bona fide, fully Krsna conscious spiritual master, there is no chance
of understanding Krsna. The educators, scholars and big political leaders
worshiped by millions of people cannot understand the goal of life and
take to Krsna consciousness, for they have not accepted a bona fide
spiritual master and the Vedas. Therefore in the Mundaka Upanisad
(3.2.3) it is said, nayam atma pravacanena labhyo na medhaya na
bahuna srutena: one cannot become self-realized simply by having an
academic education, by presenting lectures in an erudite way
(pravacanena labhyah), or by being an intelligent scientist who dis-
covers many wonderful things. One cannot understand Krsna unless one
is graced by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Only one who has sur-
rendered to a pure devotee of Krsna and taken the dust of his lotus feet
can understand Krsna. First one must understand how to get out of the
clutches of maya. The only means is to become Krsna conscious. And to
become Krsna conscious very easily, one must take shelter of a realized
soul —a mahat, or mahatma—whose only interest is to engage in the ser-
vice of the Supreme Lord. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (9.13):

mahatmanas tu mari partha
daivirh prakrtirh asritah
bhajanty ananya-manaso
jhawa bhutadim avyayam
““O son of Prtha, those who are not deluded, the great souls, are under
the protection of the divine nature. They are fully engaged in devotional
service because they know Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
original and inexhaustible.”” Therefore, to end the unwanted miseries of
life, one must become a devotee.
yasyasti bhaktir bhagavaty akificana
sarvair gunais tatra samdsate surah

“One who has unflinching devotional faith in Krsna consistently
manifests all the good qualities of Krsna and the demigods.”
(Bhag. 5.18.12)

“Only unto those great souls who have implicit faith in both the Lord and
the spiritual master are all the imports of Vedic knowledge automatically
revealed.” (Svetdsvatara Upanisad 6.23)
yam evaisa vrnute tena labhyas
tasyaisa atma vivrnute tami svam
“The Lord is obtained only by one whom He Himself chooses. To such a
person He manifests His own form.” (Mundaka Upanisad 3.2.3)
These are Vedic injunctions. One must take shelter of a self-realized
spiritual master, not a materially educated scholar or politician. One
must take shelter of a niskificana, a person engaged in devotional service
and free from material contamination. That is the way to return home,
back to Godhead.

Visnu; ddsa-vat—like a servant; arcati—serves.
TRANSLATION

This boy Prahlada is the killer of my brother, for he has given
up his family to engage in the devotional service of the enemy,
Lord Visnu, like a menial servant.

PURPORT

Hiranyaka$ipu considered his son Prahlada Maharaja to be the killer
of his brother because Prahlada Maharaja was engaged in the devotional
service of Lord Visnu. In other words, Prahlada Maharaja would be ele-
vated to saripya liberation, and in that sense he resembled Lord Visnu.
Therefore Prahlada was to be killed by Hiranyakasipu. Devotees,
Vaisnavas, attain the liberations of sa@ripya, salokya, sarsti and samipya,
whereas the Mayavadis are supposed to attain the liberation known as
sayujya. Sdyujya-mukti, however, is not very secure, whereas saripya-
mukti, salokya-mukti, sarsti-mukti and samipya-mukti are most certain.
Although the servants of Lord Vispu, Narayana, in the Vaikuntha
planets are equally situated with the Lord, the devotees there know very
well that the Lord is the master whereas they are servants.

at all believable that he will behave well toward Visnu.

Although a medicinal herb, being born in the forest, does not
belong to the same category as a man, if beneficial it is kept very
carefully. Similarly, if someone outside one’s family is favorable,
he should be given protection like a son. On the other hand, if a
limb of one’s body is poisoned by disease, it must be amputated so


--- Page 281 ---
Text 38] Prahlada, the Saintly Son of Hiranyakasipu 277
that the rest of the body may live happily. Similarly, even one’s
own son, if unfavorable, must be rejected, although born of one’s
own body.
PURPORT

Sri Caitanya Mahzprabhu has instructed all devotees of the Lord to be
humbler than the grass and more tolerant than trees; otherwise there
will always be disturbances to their execution of devotional service. Here
is a vivid example of how a devotee is disturbed by a nondevotee, even
though the nondevotee is an affectionate father. The material world is
such that a nondevotee father becomes an enemy of a devotee son. Hav-
ing determined to kill even his son, Hiranyakasipu gave the example of
amputating a part of one’s body that has become septic and therefore in-
jurious to the rest of the body. The same example, of course, may also be
applied to nondevotees. Canakya Pandita advises, tyaja durjana-
samsargar bhaja sadhu-samagamam. Devotees actually serious about
advancing in spiritual life should give up the company of nondevotees
and always keep company with devotees. To be too attached to material
existence is ignorance because material existence is temporary and
miserable. Therefore devotees who are determined to perform tapasya
(penances and austerities) to realize the self, and who are determined to
become advanced in spiritual consciousness, must give up the company
of atheistic nondevotees. Prahlada Maharaja maintained an attitude of
noncooperation with the philosophy of his father, Hiranyakasipu, yet he
was tolerant and humble. HiranyakaSipu, however, being a nondevotee,
was so polluted that he was even prepared to kill his own son. He
justified this by putting forward the logic of amputation.

Just as uncontrolled senses are the enemies of all yogis engaged
in advancing in spiritual life, this Prahlada, who appears to be a
friend, is an enemy because I cannot control him. Therefore this
enemy, whether eating, sitting or sleeping, must be killed by all
means.
PURPORT
Hiranyaka$ipu planned a campaign to kill Prahlada Maharaja. He
would kill his son by administering poison to him while he was eating, by
making him sit in boiling oil, or by throwing him under the feet of an
elephant while he was lying down. Thus HiranyakaSipu decided to kill
his innocent child, who was only five years old, simply because the boy
had become a devotee of the Lord. This is the attitude of nondevotees
toward devotees.

began striking the tender parts of Prahlada Maharaja's body with
their tridents. The demons all had fearful faces, sharp teeth and
reddish, coppery beards and hair, and they appeared extremely
threatening. Making a tumultuous sound, shouting, “Chop him
up! Pierce him!’ they began striking Prahlada Maharaja, who sat
silently, meditating upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION

Even though a person who has no assets in pious activities per-
forms some good deed, it will have no result. Thus the weapons of
the demons had no tangible effects upon Prahlada Maharaja be-
cause he was a devotee undisturbed by material conditions and
fully engaged in meditating upon and serving the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead, who is unchangeable, who cannot be realized
by the material senses, and who is the soul of the entire universe.

PURPORT

Prahlada Maharaja was constantly and fully engaged in thought of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. As it is said, govinda-parirambhitah.
Prahlada Maharaja engaged himself always in meditation, and thus he
was protected by Govinda. Just as a small child on the lap of his father or
mother is fully protected, a devotee, in all conditions, is protected by the
Supreme Lord. Does this mean that when Prahlada Maharaja was at-
tacked by the demons, the Raksasas, Govinda was also attacked by the
demons? This is not possible. There have been many attempts by the
demons to hurt or kill the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but He can-
not be injured by any material means because He is always in transcen-
dence. Therefore the words pare brahmani are used here. The demons,
the Raksasas, can neither see nor touch the Supreme Lord, although they
may superficially think that they are striking the Lord’s transcendental
body with their material weapons. The Supreme Personality of Godhead
is described in this verse as anirdesye. We cannot understand Him to be
in a particular place, for He is all-pervasive. Moreover, He is akhilatma,
the active principle of everything, even material weapons. Those who
cannot understand the position of the Lord are unfortunate. They may
think that they can kill the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His de-
votee, but all their attempts will be futile. The Lord knows how to deal
with them.

could not in any way harm Prahlada, who was completely sinless,
he was in great anxiety about what to do next.

TRANSLATION

After hearing these instructions of Sanda and Amarka, the sons
of his spiritual master, Hiranyakasipu agreed and requested them
to instruct Prahlada in that system of occupational duty which is
followed by royal householder families.

PURPORT

Hiranyaka$ipu wanted Prahlada Maharaja to be trained as a diplomatic
king in ruling the kingdom, the country or the world, but not to be ad-
vised about renunciation or the renounced order of life. The word
dharma here does not refer to some religious faith. As clearly stated,
dharmo hy asyopadestavyo rajidari yo grha-medhinam. There are two
kinds of royal families—one whose members are simply attached to
household life and the other consisting of rdjarsis, kings who govern with
ruling power but are as good as great saints. Prahlada Maharaja wanted
to become a rajarsi, whereas Hiranyaksipu wanted him to become a king
attached to sense enjoyment (grha-medhinam). Therefore in the Aryan
system there 15 varnasrama-dharma, by which everyone should be edu-
cated according to his position in society’s division of varna (brahmana,
ksatriya, vaisya and §$idra) and asrama (brahmacarya, grhastha,
vanaprastha and sannydsa).

A devotee purified by devotional service is always in the transcenden-
tal position above the mundane qualities. Thus the difference between
Prahlada Maharaja and Hiranyakasipu was that Hiranyakaipu wanted to
keep Prahlada in mundane attachment whereas Prahlada was above the
modes of material nature. As long as one is under the control of material
nature, his occupational duty is different from that of a person not under
such control. One’s real dharma, or occupational duty, is described in
Srimad-Bhagavatam (dharma tu saksad bhagavat-pranitam). As de-
scribed to his order carriers by Dharmaraja, or Yamaraja, a living being


--- Page 292 ---
288 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 5
is a spiritual identity, and therefore his occupational duty is also
spiritual. The real dharma is that which is advised in Bhagavad-gita:
sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekari Saranarn vraja. One must give up
one’s material occupational duties, just as one must give up his material
body. Whatever one’s occupational duty, even according to the
varndsrama system, one must give it up and engage in one’s spiritual
function. One’s real dharma, or occupational duty, is explained by Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Jivera ‘svaripa’ haya—krsnera ‘nitya-dasa’:
every living being is an eternal servant of Krsna. That is one’s real oc-
cupational duty.

TRANSLATION
Thereafter, Sanda and Amarka systematically and unceasingly
taught Prahlada Maharaja, who was very submissive and humble,
about mundane religion, economic development and sense
gratification.
PURPORT
There are four processes for human society—dharma, artha, kama
and moksa—and they culminate in liberation. Human society must


--- Page 293 ---
Text 53] Prahlada, the Saintly Son of Hiranyakasipu 289
follow a process of religion to advance, and on the basis of religion one
should try to develop his economic condition so that he can fulfill his
needs for sense gratification according to the religious rules and regula-
tions. Then liberation from material bondage will be easier to attain.
That is the Vedic process. When one is above the stages of dharma,
artha, kama and moksa, one becomes a devotee. He is then on the plat-
form from which he is guaranteed not to fall again to material existence
(yad gatva na nivartante). As advised in Bhagavad-gita if one tran-
scends these four processes and is actually liberated, one engages in
devotional service. Then he is guaranteed not to fall to material existence
again.

The teachers Sanda and Amarka instructed Prahlada Maharaja in
the three kinds of material advancement called religion, economic
development and sense gratification. Prahlada, however, being
situated above such instructions, did not like them, for such in-
structions are based on the duality of worldly affairs, which in-
volve one in a materialistic way of life marked by birth, death, old
age and disease.

PURPORT
The entire world is interested in the materialistic way of life. Indeed,
practically 99.9 percent of the people in the three worlds are unin-
terested in liberation or spiritual education. Only the devotees of the
Lord, headed by such great personalities as Prahlada Maharaja and
Narada Muni, are interested in the real education of spiritual life. One
cannot understand the principles of religion while staying on the ma-
terial platform. Therefore one must follow these great personalities. As
stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (6.3.20):
svayambhir naradah sambhuh
kumarah kapilo manuh
prahlado janako bhismo
balir vaiyasakir vayam
One must follow in the footsteps of such great personalities as Lord
Brahma, Narada, Lord Siva, Kapila, Manu, the Kumaras, Prahlada
Maharaja, Bhisma, Janaka, Bali Maharaja, Sukadeva Gosvami and
Yamaraja. Those interested in spiritual life should follow Prahlada
Maharaja in rejecting the education of religion, economic development
and sense gratification. One should be interested in spiritual education.
Therefore the Krsna consciousness movement is spreading all over the
world, following in the footsteps of Prahlada Maharaja, who did not like
any of the materialistic education he received from his teachers.

TRANSLATION

When the teachers went home to attend to their household
affairs, the students of the same age as Prahlada Maharaja would
call him to take the opportunity of leisure hours for play.

PURPORT

In tiffin hours, the hours when the teachers were absent from the
classroom, the students called Prahlada Maharaja, wanting to play with
him. As will be seen from the following verses, however, Prahlada
Maharaja was not very much interested in playing. Instead, he wanted to
utilize every moment for advancing in Krsna consciousness. Therefore,
as indicated in this verse by the word krta-ksanaih, at the opportune
moment when it was possible to preach about Krsna consciousness,
Prahlada Maharaja used the time as follows.

TRANSLATION

Prahlada Maharaja, who was truly the supreme learned person,

then addressed his class friends in very sweet language. Smiling,

he began to teach them about the uselessness of the materialistic
way of life. Being very kind to them, he instructed them as
follows.
PURPORT
Prahlada Maharaja’s smiling is very significant. The other students
were very much advanced in enjoying materialistic life through religion,
economic development and sense gratification, but Prahlada Maharaja
laughed at them, knowing that this was not actual happiness, for real
happiness is advancement in Krsna consciousness. The duty of those who
follow in the footsteps of Prahlada Maharaja is to teach the entire world
how to be Krsna conscious and thus be really happy. Materialistic persons
take to so-called religion to get some blessings so that they can improve
their economic position and enjoy the material world through sense gra-
tification. But devotees like Prahlada Maharaja laugh at how foolish they
are to be busy in a temporary life without knowledge of the soul’s
transmigration from one body to another. Materialistic persons are
engaged in striving for temporary benefits, whereas persons advanced in
spiritual knowledge, such as Prahlada Maharaja, are not interested in the
materialistic way of life. Instead, they want to be elevated to an eternal
life of knowlege and bliss. Therefore, as Krsna is always compassionate
to the fallen souls, His servants, the devotees of Lord Krsna, are also in-
terested in educating the entire populace in Krsna consciousness. The
mistake of materialistic life is understood by devotees, and therefore
they smile upon it, considering it insignificant. Out of compassion,
however, such devotees preach the gospel of Bhagavad-gita all over the
world.

TRANSLATION
My dear King Yudhisthira, all the children were very much
affectionate and respectful to Prahlada Maharaja, and because of
their tender age they were not so polluted by the instructions and
actions of their teachers, who were attached to condemned duality
and bodily comfort. Thus the boys surrounded Prahlada Maharaja,
giving up their playthings, and sat down to hear him. Their hearts
and eyes being fixed upon him, they looked at him with great ear-
nestness. Prahlada Maharaja, although born in a demon family,
was an exalted devotee, and he desired their welfare. Thus he
began instructing them about the futility of materialistic life.
PURPORT
The words bala adisita-dhiyah indicate that the children, being of a
tender age, were not as polluted by materialistic life as their fathers.


--- Page 298 ---
294 Srimad-Bhagavatam [Canto 7, Ch. 5
Prahlada Maharaja, therefore, taking advantage of the innocence of his
class friends, began teaching them about the importance of spiritual life
and the insignificance of materialistic life. Although the teachers Sanda
and Amarka were instructing all the boys in the materialistic life of
religion, economic development and sense gratification, the boys were
not much polluted. Therefore, with great attention they wanted to hear
from Prahlada Maharaja about Krsna consciousness. In our Krsna con-
sciousness movement, the guru-kula plays an extremely important part
in our activities because right from childhood the boys at the guru-kula
are instructed about Krsna consciousness. Thus they become steady
within the cores of their hearts, and there is very little possibility that
they will be conquered by the modes of material nature when they are
older.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Seventh Canto, Fifth
Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled “Prahlada Maharaja, the
Saintly Son of Hiranyakasipu.”

The Author

His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada appeared in
this world in 1896 in Calcutta, India. He first met his spiritual master,
Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami, in Calcutta in 1922. Bhakti-
siddhanta Sarasvati, a prominent devotional scholar and the founder of
sixty-four Gaudiya Mathas (Vedic institutes), liked this educated young
man and convinced him to dedicate his life to teaching Vedic knowledge.
Srila Prabhupada became his student, and eleven years later (1933) at
Allahabad he became his formally initiated disciple.

At their first meeting, in 1922, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati
Thakura requested Srila Prabhupada to broadcast Vedic knowledge
through the English language. In the years that followed, Srila Prabhu-
pada wrote a commentary on the Bhagavad-gita, assisted the Gaudiya
Matha in its work and, in 1944, without assistance, started an English
fortnightly magazine, edited it, typed the manuscripts and checked the
galley proofs. He even distributed the individual copies freely and strug-
gled to maintain the publication. Once begun, the magazine never
stopped; it is now being continued by his disciples in the West.

Recognizing Srila Prabhupada’s philosophical learning and devotion,
the Gaudiya Vaisnava Society honored him in 1947 with the title
“Bhaktivedanta.”” In 1950, at the age of fifty-four, Srila Prabhupada
retired from married life, and four years later he adopted the
vanaprastha (retired) order to devote more time to his studies and writ-
ing. Srila Prabhupida traveled to the holy city of Vrndavana, where he
lived in very humble circumstances in the historic medieval temple of
Radha-Damodara. There he engaged for several years in deep study and
writing. He accepted the renounced order of life (sannydsa) in 1959. At
Radha-Damodara, Srila Prabhupada began work on his life’s master-
piece: a multivolume translation and commentary on the eighteen thou-
sand verse Srimad-Bhagavatam (Bhagavata Purana). He also wrote
Easy Journey to Other Planets.

After publishing three volumes of Bhagavatamn, Srila Prabhupada
came to the United States, in 1965, to fulfill the mission of his spiritual
master. Since that time, His Divine Grace has written over forty volumes
of authoritative translations, commentaries and summary studies of the
philosophical and religious classics of India.

298 Srimad-Bhagavatam

In 1965, when he first arrived by freighter in New York City, Srila
Prabhupada was practically penniless. It was after almost a year of great
difficulty that he established the International Society for Krishna Con-
sciousness in July of 1966. Under his careful guidance, the Society has
grown within a decade to a worldwide confederation of almost one
hundred asramas, schools, temples, institutes and farm communities.

In 1968, Srila Prabhupada created New Vrndavana, an experimental
Vedic community in the hills of West Virginia. Inspired by the success of
New Vrndavana, now a thriving farm community of more than one thou-
sand acres, his students have since founded several similar communities
in the United States and abroad.

In 1972, His Divine Grace introduced the Vedic system of primary and
secondary education in the West by founding the Gurukula school in
Dallas, Texas. The school began with 3 children in 1972, and by the
beginning of 1975 the enrollment had grown to 150.

Srila Prabhupada has also inspired the construction of a large inter-
national center at Sridhama Mayapur in West Bengal, India, which is also
the site for a planned Institute of Vedic Studies. A similar project is the
magnificent Krsna-Balarama Temple and International Guest House in
Vrndavana, India. These are centers where Westerners can live to gain
firsthand experience of Vedic culture.

Srila Prabhupada’s most significant contribution, however, is his
books. Highly respected by the academic community for their authori-
tativeness, depth and clarity, they are used as standard textbooks in
numerous college courses. His writings have been translated into eleven
languages. The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, established in 1972 ex-
clusively to publish the works of His Divine Grace, has thus become the
world’s largest publisher of books in the field of Indian religion and phi-
losophy. Its latest project is the publishing of Srila Prabhupada’s most
recent work: a seventeen-volume translation and commentary —com-
pleted by Srila Prabhupada in only eighteen months—on the Bengali
religious classic Sri Caitanya-caritamrta.

In the past ten years, in spite of his advanced age, Srila Prabhupada
has circled the globe twelve times on lecture tours that have taken him to
six continents. In spite of such a vigorous schedule, Srila Prabhupada
continues to write prolifically. His writings constitute a veritable library
of Vedic philosophy, religion, literature and culture.

SRIMAD

Srimad-Bhagavatam, an epic philosophical and
literary classic, holds a prominent position in
India’s voluminous written wisdom. The timeless
wisdom of India is expressed in the Vedas, ancient
Sanskrit texts that touch upon all fields of human
knowledge. Originally preserved through oral tradi-
tion, the Vedas were first put into writing by Srila
Vyasadeva, the “literary incarnation of God.” After -
compiling the Vedas, Srila Vyasadeva was inspired
by his spiritual master to present their profound
essence in the form of Srimad-Bhagavatam. Known
as “the ripened fruit of the tree of Vedic literature,”
Srimad-Bhagavatam is the most complete and au-
thoritative exposition of Vedic knowledge.

After writing the Bhagavatam, Vyasa taught it to
his son, Sukadeva Gosvami, who later spoke the
Bhagavatam to Maharaja Pariksit in an assembly of
sages on the bank of the sacred Ganges River. Al-
though Maharaja Pariksit was a great rajarsi (saintly
king) and the emperor of the world, when he
received notice of his death seven days in advance, he
renounced his entire kindgom and retired to the
bank of the Ganges to seek spiritual enlightenment.
The questions of King Pariksit and Sukadeva
Gosvami’s illuminating answers, concerning every-
thing from the nature of the self to the origin of the
universe, are the basis of Srimad-Bhagavatam.

This edition of Bhagavatam is the only complete
English translation with an elaborate and scholarly
commentary, and it is the first edition widely avail-
able to the English-reading public. This work is the
product of the scholarly and devotional effort of His
Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhu-
pada, the world’s most distinguished teacher of
Indian religious and philosophical thought. His
Sanskrit scholarship and intimate familiarity with
Vedic culture combine to reveal to the West a mag-
nificent exposition of this important classic.

With its comprehensive system of providing the
original Sanskrit text, Roman transliteration, precise
word-for-word equivalents. a lucid English transla-
tion and a comprehensive commentary, it will appeal
to scholars, students and laymen alike. The entire
multivolume text, presented by the Bhaktivedanta
Book Trust, promises to occupy a significant place in
the intellectual, cultural and spiritual life of modern
man for a long time to come.

What the reviewers say about the Srimad-
Bhagavatam, by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhakti-
vedanta Swami Prabhupada:

ठ “It has been my great pleasure recently to have
read the Srimad-Bhagavatam in the superb edition
authorized by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhu-
pada. [ am sure this monumental work will go far to
bring the sublime message of the Bhagavatam to
numerous Westerners who otherwise would miss this
opportunity.”

Dr. Alex Wayman
Professor of Sanskrit
Columbia University

“Srimad-Bhagavatam is a valuable source ma-
terial for several categories of readers. With its ex-
haustive plan of providing the original Sanskrit text,
15 Roman transliteration, English synonyms,
English translation and elaborate commentary by a
scholar and practitioner of philosophy. it cannot but
be attractive to serious students and scholars of
religion and philosophy. I recommend this series to
anyone as an important and useful reference work.”

Professor C. P. Agrawal

Chairman

Department of Humanities
University of Michigan

“The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust editions of
famous religious classics of India with new transla-
tions and commentaries are an important addition to
our expanding knowledge of spiritual India. The new
edition of the Srimad-Bhagavatam is particularly
welcome.”

Dr. John L. Mish
