Introduction

Sri Caitanya-caritamrta is the principal work on the life and teachings of अ
Krsna Caitanya. ভা Caitanya is the pioneer of a great social and religious move-
ment which began in India a little less than five hundred years ago and which has
directly and indirectly influenced the subsequent course of religious and phi-
losophical thinking not only in India but in the recent West as well.

Caitanya Mahaprabhu is regarded as a figure of great historical significance.
However, our conventional method of historical analysis —that of seeing a man as
a product of his times —fails here. $i Caitanya is a personality who transcends the
limited scope of historical settings.

At a time when, in the West, man was directing his explorative spirit toward
studying the structure of the physical universe and circumnavigating the world in
search of new oceans and continents, ঠা Krsna Caitanya, in the East, was in-
augurating and masterminding a revolution directed inward, toward a scientific
understanding of the highest knowledge of man’s spiritual nature.

The chief historical sources for the life of जा Krsna Caitanya are the kagacas (di-
aries) kept by Murari Gupta and Svaripa Damodara Gosvami. Murari Gupta, a
physician and close associate of अआ Caitanya’s, recorded extensive notes on the
first twenty-four years of अ Caitanya's life, culminating in his initiation into the
renounced order, sannydasa. The events of the rest of Caitanya Mahaprabhu's for-
ty-eight years are recorded in the diary of 5५002 Damodora Gosvami, another of
Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s intimate associates.

Sri Caitanya-caritamrta is divided into three sections called 1175, which literally
means “pastimes” —Adi-lila (the early period), Madhya-lild (the middle period)
and Antya-lila (the final period). The notes of Murari Gupta form the basis of the
Adi-lil3, and Svaripa Damodara’s diary provides the details for the Madhya- and
Antya-lilas.

The first twelve of the seventeen chapters of Adi-/ild constitute the preface for
the entire work. By referring to Vedic scriptural evidence, this preface establishes
जा Caitanya as the avatara (incarnation) of Krsna (God) for the age of Kali—the
current epoch, beginning five thousand years ago and characterized by material-
ism, hypocrisy and dissension. In these descriptions, Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who
is identical with Lord Krsna, descends to liberally grant pure love of God to the
fallen souls of this degraded age by propagating sarkirtana—literally,
“congregational glorification of God” —especially by organizing massive public
chanting of the maha-mantra (Great Chant for Deliverance). The esoteric purpose
of Lord Caitanya’s appearance in the world is revealed, his co-avatdras and prin-
cipal devotees are described and his teachings are summarized. The remaining
portion of Adi-lil3, chapters thirteen through seventeen, briefly recounts his
divine birth and his life until he accepted the renounced order. This includes his
childhood miracles, schooling, marriage and early philosophical confrontations, as
well as his organization of a widespread sarikirtana movement and his civil disobe-
dience against the repression of the Mohammedan government.

$ri Caitanya-caritamrta

The subject of Madhya-lil3, the longest of the three divisions, is a detailed nar-
ration of Lord Caitanya’s extensive and eventful travels throughout India as a
renounced mendicant, teacher, philosopher, spiritual preceptor and mystic. Dur-
ing this period of six years, ऽन Caitanya transmits his teachings to his principal dis-
ciples. He debates and converts many of the most renowned philosophers and
theologians of his time, including Sankarites, Buddhists and Muslims, and incor-
porates their many thousands of followers and disciples into his own burgeoning
numbers. A dramatic account of Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s miraculous activities at
the giant Jagannatha Cart Festival in Orissa is also included in this section.

Antya-lila concerns the last eighteen years of $i Caitanya’s manifest presence,
spent in semiseclusion near the famous Jagannatha temple at Jagannatha Puri in
Orissa. During these final years, $ri Caitanya drifted deeper and deeper into
trances of spiritual ecstasy unparalleled in all of religious and literary history,
Eastern or Western. ঠা Caitanya’s perpetual and ever-increasing religious
beatitude, graphically described in the eyewitness accounts of Svanipa Damodara
Gosvami, his constant companion during this period, clearly defy the investigative
and descriptive abilities of modern psychologists and phenomenologists of
religious experience.

The author of this great classic, Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami, born in the year
1507, was a disciple of Raghunatha dasa Gosvami, a confidential follower of
Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Raghunatha dasa, a renowned ascetic saint, heard and
memorized all the activities of Caitanya Mahaprabhu told to him by Svaripa
Damodara. After the passing away of आ Caitanya and Svaripa Damodara,
Raghunatha dasa, unable to bear the pain of separation from these objects of his
complete devotion, traveled to Vrndavana, intending to commit suicide by jump-
ing from Govardhana Hill. In Vindavana, however, he encountered Ripa Gosvami
and Sanatana Gosvami, the most confidential disciples of Caitanya Mahaprabhu.
They convinced him to give up his plan of suicide and impelled him to reveal to
them the spiritually inspiring events of Lord Caitanya’s later life. Krsnadasa Kaviraja
Gosvami was 2150 residing in Vrndavana at this time, and Raghunatha dasa
Gosvami endowed him with a full comprehension of the transcendental life of rf
Caitanya.

By this time, several biographical works had already been written on the life of
जा Caitanya by contemporary and near-contemporary scholars and devotees.
These included 9 Caitanya-carita by Murari Gupta, Caitanya-mangala by Locana
dasa Thakura and Caitanya-bhagavata. This latter text, a work by Vrndavana dasa
Thakura, who was then considered the principal authority on $rf Caitanya's life,
was highly revered. While composing his important work, Vrndavana dasa, fearing
that it would become too voluminous, avoided elaborately describing many of
the events of आ Caitanya's life, particulary the later ones. Anxious to hear of these
later pastimes, the devotees of Vrndavana requested Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami,
whom they respected as a great saint, to compose a book to narrate these

vii

$ri Caitanya-caritamrta
episodes in detail. Upon this request, and with the permission and blessings of the
Madana-mohana Deity of Vindavana, he began compiling Sri Caitanya-caritamrta,
which, due to its biographical excellence and thorough exposition of Lord
Caitanya’s profound philosophy and teachings, is regarded as the most significant
of biographical works on $ri Caitanya.

He commenced work on the text while in his late nineties and in failing health,
as he vividly describes in the text itself: “I have now become too old and dis-
turbed in invalidity. While writing, my hands tremble. | cannot remember any-
thing, nor can | see or hear properly. Still I write, and this is a great wonder.” That
he nevertheless completed, under such debilitating conditions, the greatest liter-
ary gem of medieval India is surely one of the wonders of literary history.

This English translation and commentary is the work of His Divine Grace A.C.
Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the world’s most distinguished teacher of In-
dian religious and philosophical thought. His commentary is based upon two
Bengali commentaries, one by his teacher Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami,
the eminent Vedic scholar who predicted, “The time will come when the people
of the world will learn Bengali to read Sri Caitanya-caritamrta,” and the other by
Srila Bhaktisiddhanta's father, Bhaktivinoda Thakura.

His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada is himself a disciplic
descendant of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and he 15 the first scholar to execute
systematic English translations of the major works of $ri Caitanya’s followers. His
consummate Bengali and Sanskrit scholarship and intimate familiarity with the
precepts of ऽं Krsna Caitanya are a fitting combination that eminently qualifies
him to present this important classic to the English-speaking world. The ease and
clarity with which he expounds upon difficult philosophical concepts lures even a
reader totally unfamiliar with Indian religious tradition into a genuine understand-
ing and appreciation of this profound and monumental work.

The entire text, with commentary, presented in seventeen lavishly illustrated
volumes by the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, represents a contribution of major im-
portance to the intellectual, cultural and spiritual life of contemporary man.

Dharavada cannot possibly be there. That Sri Saila is on the southern side of
Belagrama, and the Siva temple of Mallikarjuna is located there. (Refer to text fif-
teen of this chapter) It is said that there on that hill Lord Siva lived with Devi. Also
Lord Brahma lived there with all the demigods.”

TRANSLATION
When Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu arrived at southern Mathura from
Kamakosthi, He met a brahmana.
PURPORT
This southern Mathura, presently known as Madura, is situated on the banks of
the Bhagai River. This place of pilgrimage is specifically meant for the devotees of
Lord Siva; therefore it is called Saivaksetra, that is, the place where Lord Siva is
worshiped. In this area there are mountains and forests. There are also two Siva
temples, one known as Ramesvara and the other known as Sundaresvara. There is
also a temple to Devi called Minaksi-Devi, which is a very great architectural
achievement. It was built under the supervision of the kings of the Pandya
Dynasty, and when the Mohammedans attacked this temple, as well as the
temple of Sundare$vara, great damage was done. In the Christian year 1372, a
king named Kampanna Udaiyara reigned on the throne of Madura. Long ago, Em-
peror Kuladekhara ruled this area, and during his reign he established a colony of
brahmanas. A well-known king named Anantaguna Pandya is an eleventh genera-
tion descendant of Emperor Kulasekhara.

“Spirit is not within the jurisdiction of material eyes, words or mind.”
Similarly in Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.84.13):

Spiritual substance cannot be seen by the unintelligent because they do not have
the eyes or the mentality to see spirit soul. Consequently they think that there is
no such thing as spirit. However, followers of the Vedic injunctions take their in-
formation from Vedic statements, as found in Srimad-Bhagavatam and Katha
Upanisad.

Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu then went to Setubandha [Rimesvaral, where He
took His bath at a place called Dhanustirtha. From there He visited the
Ramesvara temple and then took rest.
PURPORT
The path through the ocean to the islands known as Mandapam and Pambam
consists partly of sand and partly of water. The island of Pambam is about eleven
miles long and six miles wide. From the Pambam Harbor four miles to the north is a
temple known as Ramesvara. It is said, devi-pattanam drabhya gaccheyuh setu-
bandhanam: “After visiting the temple of the goddess Durga, one should go to the
temple of Ramesvara.” In this area there are twenty-four different holy places, one
of which is Dhanustirtha, located about twelve miles southeast of Ramesévara. It is
near the last station of the South Indian Railway, a station called Ramanada. It is
said that here, due to the request of Vibhisana, the younger brother of Ravana,
Lord Ramacandra destroyed a small bridge with His bow upon returning to His
capital. If one visits Dhanustirtha, he is liberated from the cycle of birth and death.
It is also said that if one bathes at Dhanustirtha, he gets all the fruitive results of
performing the yajiia known as agnistoma. |
Setubandha is on the island of Pambam. There is a temple of Lord Siva there
called Ramesvara. This indicates that Lord Siva is a great personality whose
worshipable Deity is Lord Rima. Thus the Lord Siva found in the temple of
Ramesvara is a great devotee of Lord Ramacandra.

PURPORT
The Brahma-sarnhita is a very important scripture. $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu ac-
quired the Fifth Chapter from the Adi-keSava temple. In that Fifth Chapter, the
philosophical conclusion जां acintya-bhedabheda-tattva (simultaneous oneness
and difference) is presented. The chapter also presents methods of devotional
service, the eighteen-syllable Vedic hymn, discourses on the soul, the Supersoul
and fruitive activity, an explanation of kama-gayatri, kama-bija and the original
Maha-Visnu, and a specific description of the spiritual world, specifically Goloka
Vindavana. Brahma-sarnhita also explains the demigod Ganesa, the
Garbhodakasayi Visnu, the origin of the Gayatri mantra, the form of Govinda and
His transcendental position and abode, the living entities, the highest goal, the
goddess Durga, the meaning of austerity, the five gross elements, love of God-
head, impersonal Brahman, the initiation of Lord Brahma, and the vision of tran-
scendental love enabling one to see the Lord. The steps of devotional service are
also explained. The mind, yoga-nidra, the goddess of fortune, devotional service
in spontaneous ecstasy, incarnations beginning with Lord Ramacandra, Deities,
the conditioned soul and its duties, the truth about Lord Visnu, prayers, Vedic
hymns, Lord Siva, Vedic literature, personalism and impersonalism, good behavior
and many other subjects are also discussed. There is also a description of the sun
and the universal forms of the Lord. All these subjects are conclusively explained
in a nutshell in this Brahma-samhita.

Regarding Sankaracarya, it is understood that he was bom in the year 608 of
the $akabda Era in the month of Vaiéakha, on the third day of the waxing moon, in
a place in South India known as Kaladi. His father's name was Sivaguru, and he lost
his father at an early age. When Sankaracarya was only eight years old, he com-
pleted his study of all scriptures and took sannyasa from Govinda, who was resid-
ing on the banks of the Narmada. After accepting sannyasa, Sankaracarya stayed
with his spiritual master for some days. He then took his permission to go to
Varanasi and from there went to Badarikasrama, where he stayed until his twelfth
year. While there, he wrote a commentary ori Brahma-satra, as well as ten
Upanisads and Bhagavad-gita. He also wrote Sanat-sujatiya and Nrsirhha-tapini.
Among his many disciples, his four chief disciples are Padmapada, Sureévara,
Hastarnalaka and Trotaka. After departing from Varanasi, Sankaracarya went to
Prayaga, where he met a great learned scholar called Kumarila Bhatta.
Sankaracarya wanted to discuss the authority of the scriptures, but Kumarila Bhat-
ta, being on his deathbed. sent him to his disciple Mandana, in the city of
Mahismati. It was there that Sankaracarya defeated Mandana Misra in a discussion
of the sastras. Mandana had a wife named Sarasvati, or Ubhaya-bharati, who
served as mediator between Sankaracarya and her husband. It is said that she
wanted to discuss erotic principles and amorous love with Sankaracarya, but
Sankaracarya had been a brahmacari since birth and therefore had no experience
in amorous love. He took a month's leave from Ubhaya-bharati and, by his mystic
power, entered the body of a king who had recently died. In this way
Sankaracarya experienced the erotic principles. After attaining this experience, he
wanted to discuss erotic principles with Ubhaya-bharati, but without hearing his
discussion, she blessed him and assured the continuous existence of the Srngeri-
matha. She then took leave of material life. Afterwards, Mandana Misra took the
order of sannyssa from Sankaricirya and became known as Sureivara.

Sankaracarya defeated many scholars throughout India and converted them to his
Mayavada philosophy. He left the material body at the age of thirty-three.

As far as Matsya-tirtha is concerned, it was supposedly situated beside the
ocean in the district of Malabara.

TRANSLATION

Caitanya Mahaprabhu next arrived at the place of Madhvacarya, where the
philosophers known as Tattvavadis resided. He stayed there at a place known
as Udupi, where he saw the Deity of Lord Krsna and became mad with ecstasy.

PURPORT

Sripada Madhvacarya took his birth at Udupi, which is situated in the South
Kanada district of South India, just west of Sahyadri. This is the chief city of the
South Kanada province and is near the city of Mangalore, which is situated to the
south of Udupi. In the city of Udupi is a place called Pajaka-ksetra, where
Madhvacarya took his birth in a Sivalli-brahmana dynasty as the son of
Madhyageha Bhatta, in the year 1040 of Sakabda. According to some, he was
born in the year 1160 Sakabda.

In his childhood, Madhvacarya was known as Vasudeva, and there are some
wonderful stories surrounding him. It is also said that his father piled up many
debts, and Madhvacarya converted tamarind seeds into actual coins to pay them
off. When he was five years old, he was offered the sacred thread. One demon
named Maniman lived near his abode in the form of a snake, and at the age of five
Madhvacarya killed that snake with the toe of his left foot. When his mother was
very disturbed, he would appear before her in one jump. He was a great scholar
even in childhood, and although his father did not agree, he accepted sannyasa at
the age of twelve. After receiving sannyasa from Acyuta Preksa, he received the

42 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 9
name Parnaprajiia Tirtha. After traveling all over India, he finally discussed scrip-
tures with Vidyasankara, the exalted leader of Srngeri-matha. Vidyasankara was
actually diminished in the presence of Madhvacarya. Accompanied by Satya
Tirtha, Madhvacarya went to Badarikadrama. It was there that he met Vyasadeva
and explained his commentary on Bhagavad-gita before him. Thus he became a
great scholar by studying before Vyasadeva.

By the time he came to the Ananda-matha from Badarikasrama, Madhvacarya
had finished his commentary on Bhagavad-gita. His companion Satya Tirtha wrote
down the entire commentary. When Madhvacarya returned from Badarikasrama,
he went to Gafjama, which is on the bank of the River Godavari. He met there
with two learned scholars named Sobhana Bhatta and Svami $astri. Later these
scholars became known in the disciplic succession of Madhvacarya as Pad-
manabha Tirtha and Narahari Tirtha. When he returned to Udupi, he would some-
times bathe in the ocean. On such an occasion he composed one prayer in five
chapters. Once, while sitting beside the sea engrossed in meditation upon Lord ऽ
Krsna, he saw that a large boat containing goods for Dvaraka was in danger. He
gave some signs by which the boat could approach the shore, and it was saved.
The owners of the boat wanted to give him a present, and at the time
Madhvacarya agreed to take some gopi-candana. He received a big lump of gopi-
candana, and as it was being brought to him, it broke apart and revealed a large
Deity of Lord Krsna. The Deity had a stick in one hand and a lump of food in the
other. As soon as Madhvacarya received the Deity of Krsna in this way, he com-
posed a prayer. The Deity was so heavy that not even thirty people could raise it.
Madhvacarya personally brought this Deity to Udupi. Madhvacarya had eight dis-
ciples, all of whom took sannyasa from him and became directors of his eight
monasteries. Worship of the Lord Krsna Deity is still going on at Udupi according
to the plans Madhvacarya established.

Madhvacarya then for the second time visited Badarikasrama. While he was
passing through Maharastra, the local king was digging a big lake for the public
benefit. As Madhvacarya passed through that area with his disciples, he was also
obliged to help in the excavation. After some time, when Madhvacarya visited the
king, he engaged the king in that work and departed with his disciples.

Often in the province of Ganga Pradesh there were fights between Hindus and
Mohammedans. The Hindus were on one bank of the river, and the Moham-
medans on the other. Due to the community tension, no boat was available for
crossing the river. The Mohammedan soldiers were always stopping passengers
on the other side, but Madhvacarya did not care for these soldiers. He crossed the
river anyway, and when he met the soldiers on the other side, he was brought
before the king. The Mohammedan king was so pleased with him that he wanted
to give him a kingdom and some money, but Madhvacarya refused. While walk-
ing on the road, he was attacked by some dacoits, but by his bodily strength he


--- Page 46 ---
Text 245] Lord Caitanya’s Travels to the Holy Places 43
killed them all. When his companion Satya Tirtha was attacked by a tiger,
Madhvacarya separated them by virtue of his great strength. When he met
Vyasadeva, he received from him the salagrama-sila known as Astamarti. After
this, he summarized the Mahabharata.

Madhvacirya’s devotion to the Lord and his erudite scholarship are known
throughout India. Because of this, the owners of the $rigeri-matha established by
Sankaracarya became a little perturbed. At that time the followers of Sankaracarya
were afraid of Madhvacarya's rising power, and they began to tease
Madhvacarya’s disciples in many ways. There was even an attempt to prove that
the disciplic succession of Madhvacarya was not in line with Vedic principles. One
person named Pundarika Puri, a follower of the Mayavada philosophy of
Sankaracarya, came before Madhvacarya to discuss the $astras. It is said that all of
Madhvacarya’s books were taken away, but later they were found with the help
of King Jayasirnha, ruler of Kumla. In discussion, Pundarika Puri was defeated by
Madhvacarya. A great personality named Trivikramacarya, who was a resident of
Visnumangala, became Madhvacaryas disciple, and his son later became
Narayanacarya, the composer of Sri Madhva-vijaya. After the death of Tri-
vikramacarya, the younger brother of Narayanacarya took sannyasa and later be-
came known as Visnu Tirtha.

At that time it was reputed that there was no limit to the bodily strength of Par-
naprajia, Madhvacarya. There was a person named Kadafjari who was famed for
possessing the strength of thirty men. Madhvacarya placed the big toe of his foot
upon the ground and asked the man to separate it from the ground, but the great
strong man could not do so even after great effort. $rilaMadhvacarya passed from
this material world at the age of eighty while writing a commentary on the
Aitareya Upanisad. For further information about Madhvacarya, one should read
Madhva-vijaya by Narayana Acarya. The dcaryas of the Madhva-sampradaya
established Udupi as the chief center, and the monastery there was known as
Uttararadhi-matha. A list of the different centers of the Madhvacarya-sampradaya
can be found at Udupi, and their matha commanders are (1) Visnu Tirtha (Soda-
matha), (2) Janardana Tirtha (Krsnapura-matha), (3) Vamana Tirtha (Kanura-
matha), (4) Narasirnha Tirtha (Adamara-matha), (5) Upendra Tirtha (Puttugi-
matha), (6) Rama Tirtha (Sirura-matha), (7) Hrsikesa Tirtha (Palimara-matha), and
(8) Aksobhya Tirtha (Pejavara-matha). The disciplic succession of the
Madhvacarya-sampradaya is as follows: (1) Harhsa Paramatma; (2) Caturmukha
Brahma; (3) Sanakadi; (4) Durvasa; (5) Jaananidhi; (6) Garuda-vahana; (7) Kaivalya
Tirtha; (8) 1787652 Tirtha; (9) Para Tirtha; (10) Satyaprajia Tirtha; (11) Praja

After the sixteenth acarya (Vidyadhiraja Tirtha), there was another disciplic
succession, including Rajendra Tirtha, 1254; Vijayadhvaja; Purusottama;
Subrahmanya; Vyasa Raya, 1470-1520. The nineteenth acarya, Ramacandra
Tirtha, had another disciplic succession, including Vibudhendra, 1218; Jitamitra,
1348; Raghunandana; Surendra; Vijendra; Sudhindra; Raghavendra Tirtha, 1545.
To date, in the Udupi monastery there are another fourteen Madhva-tirtha san-
nyasis. As stated, Udupi is situated in South Kanada, about thirty-six miles north of
Mangalore. It is situated beside the sea. This information is available from the
South Kanada Manual and the Bombay Gazette.

PURPORT
According to the Tattvavadis, the best process is to execute the duties of the
four varpas and 34/73/7735. In the material world, unless one is situated in one of the
varnas (brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya and 5042) one cannot manage social affairs
properly to attain the ultimate goal. One also has to follow the principles of the
asramas (brahmacarya, grhastha, vanaprastha and sannyasa), which are considered
essential for the attainment of the highest goal. In this way the Tattvavadis
establish that the execution of the principles of varpa and asrama for the sake of
Krsna is the best way to attain the topmost goal. The Tattvavadis thus established
their principles in terms of human society. $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, however, dif-
fered when He said that the best process is hearing and chanting about Lord
Visnu. According to the Tattvavadis, the highest goal is returning home, back to
Godhead, but in ১1 Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s opinion the highest goal is attaining
love of Godhead, either in the material or spiritual world. In the material world this
is practiced according to $astric injunction, and in the spiritual world the real
achievement is already there.

Everyone is after success in religion, economic development, sense gratification
and ultimately merging into the existence of Brahman. These are the general prac-
tices of the common man, but according to the strict principles of the Vedas, the
highest attainment is to rise to the platform of sravanam, kirtanam— chanting and
hearing about the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is confirmed in Srimad-
Bhagavatam (1.1.2):

“Completely rejecting all religious activities which are materially motivated, this
Bhagavata Purana propounds the highest truth, which is understandable by those
devotees who are pure in heart. The highest truth is reality distinguished from illu-
sion for the welfare of all. Such truth uproots the threefold miseries. This beautiful
Bhagavatam, compiled by the great sage 7 Vyasadeva, is sufficient in itself for
God realization. As soon as one attentively and submissively hears the message of
Bhagavatam, he becomes attached to the Supreme Lord.”

According to Sridhara Svami, the material conception of success (moksa or
liberation) is desired by those in material existence. Not being situated in material
existence, the devotees have no desire for liberation.

A devotee is always liberated in all stages of life because he is always engaged
in the nine items of devotional service (sravanam, kirtanam, etc.). ঠা Caitanya
Mahaprabhu’s philosophy holds that devotional service to Krsna always exists in
everyone's heart. It simply has to be awakened by the process of sravanar
kirtanarn visnoh. Sravanadi suddha-citte karaye udaya (Cc. Madhya 22.107).
When a person is actually engaged in devotional service, his eternal relationship
with the Lord, the servant-master relationship, is awakened.

54 $ri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 9
PURPORT

In the Vedas there are three kandas, or divisions: karma-kanda, jAiana-kanda,
and updsana-kanda. The karma-kanda portion stresses the execution of fruitive
activities, although ultimately it is advised that one abandon both karma-kanda
and jAana-kanda (speculative knowledge) and accept only upasana-kanda, or
bhakti-kanda. One cannot attain love of Godhead by executing karma-kanda or
jiana-kanda. However, by dedicating one’s karma, or fruitive activities, to the
Supreme Lord, one may be relieved from the polluted mind. But when one is ac-
tually free from mental pollution, one must be elevated to the spiritual platform. It
is then that one needs the association of a pure devotee, for only by a pure devo-
tee’s association can one become a pure devotee of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Krsna. When one comes to the stage of pure devotional service, the
process of sravapam kirtanam is very essential. By executing the nine items of
devotional service, one is completely purified. Anyabhilasita-sanyar jiana-kar-
mady-anavrtam (8.1.5. 1.1.12). Only then is one able to execute the order of
Krsna.

man-mana bhava mad-bhakto
mad-yaji mar namaskuru
mam evaisyasi satyam te
pratijane priyo ‘si me
“Always think of Me and become My devotee. Worship Me and offer your
homage unto Me. Thus you will come to Me without fail. | promise you this be-
cause you are My very dear friend.” (Bg. 18.65)
sarva-dharman parityajya
mam ekarn sarapam vraja
aharn tvarh sarva-papebhyo
moksayisyami ma sucah
“Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. | shall deliver you
from all sinful reaction. Do not fear.” (Bg. 18.66)

In this way one develops his original constitutional position by which he can
render loving service to the Lord. One cannot be elevated to the highest platform
of devotional service by karma-kanda or jiana-kanda. Pure devotional service can
be understood and attained only through the association of pure devotees. In this
regard, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvatt Thakura states that there are two types of
karma-kanda activities— pious and impious. Pious activities are certainly preferred
to impious activities, but even pious activities cannot assure one ecstatic love of
Cod, Krsna. Pious and impious activities can bring about material happiness or dis-
tress, but there is no possibility in one’s becoming a pure devotee simply by acting
piously or impiously. Bhakti, devotional service, means satisfying Krsna. In every


--- Page 58 ---
Text 264] Lord Caitanya’s Travels to the Holy Places 55
revealed scripture—whether jiana-kanda or karma-kanda is stressed—the prin-
ciple of renunciation is always praised. The ripened fruit of Vedic knowledge,
Srimad-Bhagavatam, is the supreme Vedic evidence. In Srimad-Bhagavatam it is
said:
naiskarmyam apy acyuta-bhava-varjitam
na Sobhate jianam alam nirafijanam
kutah punah sasvad abhadram isvare
na carpitarn karma yad apy akarapam
“Knowledge of self-realization, even though freed from all material affinity, does
not look well if devoid of a conception of the Infallible [God]. What, then, is the
use of fruitive activities, which are naturally painful from the very beginning and
transient by nature, if they are not utilized for the devotional service of the Lord?”
(Bhag. 1.5.12) This means that even knowledge, which is superior to fruitive ac-
tivity, is not successful if it is devoid of devotional service. In all scriptures —in the
beginning, middle and end—karma-kanda and jAana-kanda are condemned. In
Srimad-Bhagavatam it is said: dharmah projjhita-kaitavo ‘tra. ,
This is explained in the following verses taken from Srimad-Bhagavatam
(11.11.32) and Bhagavad-gita (18.66).

Sambhu (Siva), he became a little ashamed and criticized Lord Siva, who was sit-
ting just like an ordinary man with his wife on his lap. For this reason Citraketu was
cursed by Parvati. Later he became a demon named Vrtrasura. Citraketu was a
very powerful king and a devotee, and he could certainly retaliate even against
Lord Siva, but when Parvati cursed him, he immediately accepted the curse with a
bowed head. When he agreed to accept this curse, Lord Siva praised him and told
Parvati that a devotee of Lord Narayana is never afraid of accepting any position
provided there is a chance to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is
the purport of narayana-parah sarve na kutascana bibhyati.

favor pure devotional service, which must be devoid of the taints of fruitive ac-
tivity and speculative knowledge. As far as fruitive activity is concerned, the con-
tamination is elevation to a higher standard of life, and for speculative knowledge
the contamination is merging into the existence of the Absolute Truth. The Tat-
tvavada sampradaya of the Madhvacarya school sticks to the principle of var-
nasrama-dharma, which involves fruitive activity. Their ultimate goal (mukti) is
simply a form of desire. A pure devotee should be free from all kinds of desire. He
simply engages in the service of the Lord. Nonetheless, Caitanya Mahaprabhu was
pleased that the Madhvacarya-sampradaya, or the Tattvavada sampradaya, ac-
cepted the transcendental form of the Lord. This is the great qualification of these
Vaisnava sampradayas.

It is the Mayavada sampradaya that does not accept the transcendental form of
the Lord. If a Vaisnava sampradaya is also carried away by that impersonal at-
titude, that sampradaya has no position at all. It is a fact that there are many so-
called Vaisnavas whose ultimate aim is to merge into the existence of the Lord.
The sahajiyas’ Vaisnava philosophy is to become one with the Supreme. Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu points out that Sri Madhavendra Puri accepted
Madhvacarya only because his sampradaya accepted the transcendental form of
the Lord.

PURPORT

The Apsaras, denizens of the heavenly planets, are generally known as dancing
girls. The girls in the heavenly planets are exquisitely beautiful, and if a woman on
earth is found to be very beautiful, she is compared to the Apsaras. There were
five Apsaras named Lata, Budbuda, Samici, Saurabheyi and Varna. It is said that
these five beautiful dancing girls were sent by Indra to break the severe austerity
of a saintly person called Acyuta Rsi. This action was typical of Indra, the King of
heaven. Whenever Indra discovered someone undergoing severe austerities, he
would begin to fear for his post. Indra is always anxious about his position, fearing
that if someone becomes more powerful than him, he would lose his elevated
position. As soon as he would see a saint undergoing severe austerities, he would
send dancing girls to distract him. Even the great saint Visvamitra Muni fell victim
to his plan.

When the five Apsaras went to break Acyuta 1২515 meditation, they were all
chastised and cursed by the saint. As a result, the girls turned into crocodiles in a
lake that came to be known as Paficapsara. Lord Ramacandra also visited this
place. From Sri Narada Muni's narration, it is understood that when Arjuna went to
visit the holy places, he learned about the condemnation of the five Apsaras. He
delivered them from their abominable condition, and from that day the lake came
to be known as 12380385313, and it became a place of pilgrimage.

PURPORT
Kolapura is a town in the Maharastra province formerly known as Bombay Pra-
desh. Formerly it was a native state, and it is bordered on the north by the district
of Santara, on the east and south by the district of Belagama, and on the west by
the district of Ratnagiri. In this place there is a river named Uma. From the Bombay
Cazette it is understood that there were about 250 temples there, out of which
six are very famous. These are (1) Ambabai, or Mahalaksmi Mandira, (2) Vithoba
Mandira, (3) Temblai Mandira, (4) Mahakali Mandira, (5) Phiranga-i, or Pratyangira
Mandira, and (6) Yyallamma Mandira.

This city of Pandarapura is situated on the River Bhima. It is said that Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu initiated Tukarama when He visited Pandarapura. This
Tukarama Acarya became very famous in the Maharastra province, and he spread
the sarikirtana movement all over the province. The sarikirtana party belonging to
Tukarama is still very popular in Bombay in the province of Maharastra. Tukarama
was a disciple of $i Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and his book is known 25 Abhariga. His
sarikirtana party exactly resembles the Caudiya-Vaisnava sarikirtana parties, for
they chant the holy name of the Lord with mrdariga and karatalas.
The Lord Viththaladeva mentioned in this verse is a form of Lord Visnu with
four hands. He is Narayana.

70 $ri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 9
PURPORT

Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura remarks that in the disciplic succession
of Madhvacarya —up to the advent of His Holiness Sripada Laksmipati Tirtha—
only Lord Krsna was worshiped. After Srila Madhavendra Puri, worship of both
Radha and Krsna was established. For this reason $riMadhavendra Puri is accepted
as the root of worship in ecstatic love. Unless one is connected to the disciplic
succession of Madhavendra Puri, there is no possibility of awakening the
symptoms of ecstatic love. The word gosaiii is significant in this connection. The
spiritual master who is fully surrendered unto the Supreme Personality of God-
head and has no business other than the Lord's service is called the best of the
paramaharnsas. A paramaharisa has no program for sense gratification; he is in-
terested only in satisfying the senses of the Lord. One who has control of the
senses in this way is called a gosani or a gosvami, master of the senses. The senses
cannot be controlled unless one is engaged in the service of the Lord; therefore
the bona fide spiritual master, who has full control over his senses, engages twen-
ty-four hours a day in the Lord's service. He can therefore be addressed as gosani
or gosvami. The title gosvami cannot be inherited but can be given only to a bona
fide spiritual master.

There were six great Cosvamis of Vindavana—S$rila Rapa, Sanatana, Bhatta
Raghunatha, $i Jiva, Gopala Bhatta and Dasa Raghunatha—and none of them in-
herited the title of gosvami. All the Gosvamis of Vrndavana were bona fide
spiritual masters situated on the highest platform of devotional service, and for
that reason they were called gosvamis. All the temples of Vindavana were cer-
tainly started by the six Gosvamis. Later the worship in the temples was entrusted
to some householder disciples of the Gosvamis, and since then the hereditary title
of gosvami has been used. However, only one who is a bona fide spiritual master
expanding the cult of जा Caitanya Mahaprabhu, the Krsna consciousness move-
ment, and who is in full control of his senses can be addressed as a gosvami. Un-
fortunately, the hereditary process is going on; therefore at the present moment,
in most cases the title is being misused due to ignorance of the word's etymology.

In the $ri Caitanya-candrodaya (eighth part) $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu said,
“Sarvabhauma, | have traveled to many holy places, but | cannot find a Vaisnava
as good as you anywhere. However, | must admit that Raimananda Raya is won-
derful.”

Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya replied, “Therefore, my Lord, requested that You see
him.”

Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu then said, “There are, of course, many Vaisnavas in
these holy places, and most of them worship Lord Narayana. Others, who are
called Tattvavadis, are also Laksmi-Narayana worshipers, but they do not belong
to the pure Vaisnava cult. There are many worshipers of Lord Siva, and there are
also many atheists. Regardless, My dear Bhattacarya, | very much like Raimananda
Raya and his opinions.”

Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura points out that in the seventy-fourth
verse of this chapter it is stated that Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu visited the temple
of Siyali-bhairavi, but actually at Siyali, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu visited the
temple of आ Bhi-varaha. Near Siyali and Cidambaram there is a temple known as
$i Musnam. In this temple there is a Deity of $ri Bhx-varaha. In the jurisdiction of
Cidambaram there is a district known as southern Arkata. The town of Siyali is in
that district. There is a temple of Sri Bha-varahadeva nearby, not Bhairavi-devi.
This is Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura’s conclusion.

PURPORT
Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura remarks, “The impersonalists imagine
some forms of the Absolute Truth through the direct perception of their senses.
The impersonalists worship such imaginary forms, but neither Srimad-Bhagavatam


--- Page 106 ---
Text 360] Lord Caitanya’s Travels to the Holy Places 103
nor $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu accepts this sense gratificatory worship to be of any
spiritual significance.” The Mayavadis imagine themselves to be the Supreme.
They imagine that the Supreme has no personal form and that all His forms are
imaginary like the will-o’-the-wisp or a flower in the sky. Both Mayavadis and
those who imagine forms of God are misguided. According to them, worship of
the Deity or any form of the Lord is a result of the conditioned soul's illusion.
However, $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu confirms the conclusion of Srimad-
Bhagavatam on the strength of His philosophy of acintya-bhedabheda-tattva. That
philosophy holds that the Supreme Lord is simultaneously one with and different
from His creation. That is to say, there is unity in diversity. In this way $ri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu proved the impotence of fruitive workers, speculative empiric phi-
losophers and mystic yogis. The realization of such men is simply a waste of time
and energy.

To set the example, 6 Caitanya Mahaprabhu personally visited temples in
various holy places. Wherever He visited, He immediately exhibited His ecstatic
love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When a Vaisnava visits the temple
of a demigod, his vision of that demigod is different from the vision of the imper-
sonalists and Mayavadis. Brahma-samhita supports this. A Vaisnava’s visit to the
temple of Lord Siva is different from a nondevotee's visit. The nondevotee con-
siders the deity of Lord Siva an imaginary form because he ultimately thinks that
the Supreme Absolute Truth is void. However, a Vaisnava sees Lord Siva as being
simultaneously one with and different from the Supreme Lord. In this regard, the
example of milk and yogurt is given. Yogurt is actually nothing but milk, but at the
same time it is not milk. It is simultaneously one with milk yet different from it.
This is the philosophy of $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and it is confirmed by
Bhagavad-gita:

maya tatam 14207) sarvari
jagad avyakta-martina
mat-sthani sarva-bhatani
na caharh tesv avasthitah
“By Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded. All beings are
in Me, but I am not in them.” (Bg. 9.4)

The Absolute Truth, God, is everything, but this does not mean that everything
is God. For this reason ঠা Caitanya Mahaprabhu and His followers visited the
temples of all the demigods, but they did not see them in the same way an imper-
sonalist sees them. Everyone should follow in the footsteps of Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu and visit all temples. Sometimes mundane sahajiyas suppose that
the gopis visited the temple of Katyayani in the same way mundane people visit
the temple of Devi. However, the gopis prayed to Katyayani to grant them Krsna
as their husband. Mundaners visit the temple of Katyayani to receive some ma-


--- Page 107 ---
104 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 9
terial profit. That is the difference between a Vaisnava's visit and a nondevotee’s
visit.

Not understanding the process of the disciplic succession, so-called logicians
put forward the theory of henotheism (paficopasana); that is, they believe that
the worship of one god does not deny the existence of other gods. Such philo-
sophical speculation is not accepted by 317 Caitanya Mahaprabhu or by Vaisnavas.
Impersonalists may accept any number of deities, but Vaisnavas only accept Krsna
as the Supreme and reject all others. Mayavada deity worship is certainly idolatry,
and their imaginary deity worship has recently been transformed into Mayavada
impersonalism. For want of Krsna consciousness, people are victimized by the
Mayavada philosophy, and consequently they sometimes become staunch
atheists. However, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu established the process of self-
realization by His own personal behavior. As stated in Caitanya-caritamrta:

sthavara-jangama dekhe, na dekhe tara marti
sarvatra haya nija ista-deva-spharti
“The maha-bhagavata, the advanced devotee, certainly sees everything mobile
and immobile, but he does not exactly see their forms. Rather, everywhere he
sees the form of the Supreme Lord immediately manifest. Seeing the energy of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Vaisnava immediately remembers the tran-
scendental form of the Lord.” (Cc. Madhya 8.274)

TRANSLATION

In this age of Kali, there are no genuine religious principles. There are only
the Vaisnava devotees and the Vaisnava devotional scriptures. This is the sum
and substance of everything.

PURPORT

One must have firm faith in the process of devotional service and the scriptures
that support it. If one hears the activities of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu with faith,
he can be freed from his envious position. Srimad-Bhagavatam is meant for such
nonenvious persons (nirmatsaranarn satam). In this age a person should not envy
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s movement but should chant the holy names of Hari
and Krsna, the maha-mantra. That is the sum and substance of eternal religion,
known as sanatana-dharma. The real Vaisnava is a pure devotee and fully realized
soul, and a Vaisnava sastra refers to sruti, or the Vedas, which are called sabda-pra-
mana, the evidence of transcendental sound. If one strictly follows the Vedic
literature and chants the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he
will actually be situated in the transcendental disciplic succession. Those who
want to attain life's ultimate goal must follow this principle. In Srimad-Bhagavatam
(11.19.17), it is said:

$rutih pratyaksam aitihyam
anumanarn catustayam
pramarnesv anavasthanad
vikalpat sa virajyate

“Vedic literature, direct perception, history and hypothesis are the four kinds of
evidential proofs. Everyone should stick to these principles for the realization of
the Absolute Truth.”

CHAPTER 10
The Lord’s Return to Jagannatha Puri
While Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu was traveling in South India, Sarvabhauma Bhat-
tacarya had many talks with King Prataparudra. When Maharaja Prataparudra re-
quested the Bhattacarya to arrange an interview with the Lord, Bhattacarya
assured him that he would try to do so as soon as Caitanya Mahaprabhu returned
from South India. When the Lord returned to Jagannatha Puri from His South In-
dian tour, He lived at the home of Kasi Misra. Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya in-
troduced many Vaisnavas to Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu after His return. The father
of Ramananda Raya, Bhavananda Raya, offered another son named Vaninatha Pat-
tanayaka for the Lord's service. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu informed His associates
about the pollution of Krsnadasa brought about by his association with the Bhat-
tatharis, and thus the Lord proposed to give him leave. Nityananda Prabhu sent
Krsnadasa to Bengal to inform the Navadvipa devotees about the Lord's return to
Jagannatha Puri. All the devotees of Navadvipa thus began arranging to come to
Jagannatha Puri. At this time Paramananda Puri was at Navadvipa, and im-
mediately upon hearing news of the Lord's return, he started for Jagannatha Puri
accompanied by a brahmana named Kamalakanta. Purusottama Bhattacarya, a
resident of Navadvipa, was educated at Varanasi. He accepted the renounced
order from Caitanyananda, but he himself took the name of Svarapa. Thus he ar-
rived at the lotus feet of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. After the demise of $ri Tsvara
Puri, his disciple Covinda, following his instructions, went to see Caitanya
Mahaprabhu. Due to his relationship with Kesava Bharati, Brahmananda Bharati
was also respectfully received by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. When he arrived at
Jagannatha Puri, he was advised to give up the deerskin clothing he wore. When
Brahmananda understood जा Caitanya Mahaprabhu correctly, he accepted Him as
Krsna himself. However, when Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya addressed Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu as Krsna, the Lord immediately protested. In the meantime, Kasisvara
Cosvami also came to see Caitanya Mahaprabhu. In this chapter, devotees from
many different areas come to see Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and they are exactly like
many rivers that come from many places to finally flow into the sea.

(1.13.10) is also quoted in the Adi-lila (1.63).

TRANSLATION
“A Vaisnava travels to places of pilgrimage to purify them and reclaim
fallen conditioned souls. This is one of the duties of a Vaisnava. Actually, Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu is not a living entity but the Supreme Personality of
Godhead Himself. Consequently, He is a fully independent controller, yet in
His position as a devotee, He carries out the activities of a devotee.”
PURPORT
Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura points out that because there are many
permanent residents in holy places who do not precisely follow the rules and
regulations governing living in a sacred place, exalted devotees have to go to
these places to reclaim them. This is the business of a Vaisnava. A Vaisnava is
unhappy to see others materially enmeshed. Although Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is
the worshipable Deity of all Vaisnavas, the activities of a Vaisnava were taught by
Him. Nonetheless, He is the complete and independent Supreme Personality of


--- Page 118 ---
116 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 10
Godhead. He is parnah suddho nitya-muktah. He is complete, completely uncon-
taminated and eternal. He is sanatana, for He has no beginning or end.

TRANSLATION
The King said, ‘‘Bhattacarya, you are the most learned and experienced per-
son | know. Therefore when you address Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu as Lord
Krsna, 1 accept this as the truth.
PURPORT
This is the way to advance in spiritual science. One must accept the words of
an acarya, a bona fide spiritual master, to clear the path for spiritual advancement.
This is the secret of success. However, one’s guide must be a spiritual master who
is actually an unalloyed devotee strictly following the instructions of the previous
acarya without deviation. Whatever the spiritual master says must be accepted by
the disciple. Only then is success certain. This is the Vedic system.
Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya was a brahmana and a realized soul, whereas Pra-
taparudra was a ksatriya. Ksatriya kings used to obey very faithfully the orders of
learned brahmanas and saintly persons, and in this way they would rule their

118 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 10
country. Similarly, vaisyas used to follow the king's orders, and the sadras used to
serve the three higher castes. In this way the brahmanas, ksatriyas, vaisyas and
sadras used to live cooperatively performing their respective duties. Conse-
quently society was peaceful, and people were able to discharge the duties of
Krsna consciousness. Thus they were happy in this life and able to return home,
back to Codhead.

tunate; mora grhe—in my home; prabhu-padera—of the Lord of the prabhus;
habe —there will be; avasthana—staying.
TRANSLATION
When Kasi Misra heard the proposal, he said, “1 am very fortunate that Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu, the Lord of all prabhus, will stay at my home.”
PURPORT
In this verse the word Prabhupada, referring to Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, is sig-
nificant. Regarding this, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami Prabhupada com-
ments, “Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself,
Sri Krsna, and all His servants address Him as Prabhupada. This means that there
are many prabhus taking shelter under His lotus feet.” The pure Vaisnava is ad-
dressed as prabhu, and this address is an etiquette observed between Vaisnavas.
When many prabhus remain under the shelter of the lotus feet of another prabhu,
the address Prabhupada is given. अ Nityananda Prabhu and Sri Advaita Prabhu are
also addressed as Prabhupada. Sr Caitanya Mahaprabhu, Si Advaita Prabhu and
Sri Nityananda Prabhu are all vispu-tattva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Lord Visnu. Therefore all living entities are under Their lotus feet. Lord Visnu is the
eternal Lord of everyone, and the representative of Lord Visnu is the Lord's confi-
dential servant. Such a person acts as the spiritual master for neophyte Vaisnavas;


--- Page 123 ---
Text 25] The Lord’s Return to Jagannatha Puri 121
therefore the spiritual master is as respectable as Sri Krsna Caitanya or Lord Visnu
Himself. For this reason the spiritual master is addressed as Orn Visnupada or
Prabhupada. The acarya, the spiritual master, is generally respected by others as
Sripada, and the initiated Vaisnavas are addressed as Prabhu. Prabhu, Prabhupada
and Visnupada are described in revealed scriptures like Srimad-Bhagavatam,
Caitanya-caritamrta and Caitanya-bhagavata. In this regard, these scriptures pre-
sent evidence accepted by unalloyed devotees.

The prakrta-sahajiyas are not even worthy of being called Vaisnavas. They think
that only caste gosvamis should be called Prabhupada. Such ignorant sahajiyas call
themselves vaispava-dasa-anudasa, which means the servant of the servant of the
Vaisnavas. However, they are opposed to addressing a pure Vaisnava as Prabhu-
pada. In other words, they are envious of a bona fide spiritual master who is ad-
dressed as Prabhupada, and they commit offenses by considering a bona fide
spiritual master an ordinary human being or a member of a certain caste. Srila
Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura describes such sahajiyas as most unfortunate.
Because of their misconceptions, they fall into a hellish condition.

the social divisions; visayi—engaged in mundane affairs; adhama—very fallen;
tabu—still; tumi—You; sparsa—touch; ei—this; iSvara-laksapa—sign of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION

After hearing Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s praise, Bhavananda Raya submit-
ted, “| am in the fourth class of the social order, and | engage in mundane
affairs. Although 1 am very fallen, You have still touched us. This is proof that
You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead.”

PURPORT
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (5.18):
vidya-vinaya-sampanne
brahmane gavi hastini
Suni caiva $vapake ca
panditah sama-darsinah

“The humble sage, by virtue of true knowledge, sees with equal vision a learned
and gentle brahmana, a cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater [outcaste].”

Those who are highly advanced in spiritual understanding do not care about a
person's material condition. A spiritually advanced person sees the spiritual iden-
tity of every living being, and consequently he makes no distinction between a
learned brahmana, a dog, a candala or anyone else. He is not influenced by the
material body but sees a person's spiritual identity. Consequently Bhavananda
Raya appreciated Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s statement, which showed that the
Lord did not consider the social position of Bhavananda Raya, who belonged to
the sudra caste engaged in mundane activities. Rather, the Lord considered the
spiritual position of Bhavananda Raya, Ramananda Raya and his brothers. The ser-
vant of the Lord is also similarly inclined. He gives shelter to any person—any liv-
ing entity — regardless of whether one belongs to a brahmana family or is a can-
dala. The spiritual master reclaims all people and encourages everyone in spiritual
life. By taking shelter of such a devotee, one can make his life successful. As con-
firmed in Srimad-Bhagavatam (2.4.18):

kirata-hanandhra-pulinda-pulkasa
abhira-Sumbha yavanah khasadayah
ye ‘nye ca papa yad-apasrayasrayah
Sudhyanti tasmai prabhavisnave namah


--- Page 138 ---
136 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 10
“Kirata, Hana, Andhra, Pulinda, Pulkasa, Abhira, Sumbha, Yavana and the Khasa
races, and even others who are addicted to sinful acts, can be purified by taking
shelter of the devotees of the Lord due to His being the supreme power. | beg to
offer my respectful obeisances unto Him.”

Whoever takes shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His pure
devotee is elevated to the spiritual order and purified from material contamina-
tion. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (9.32):

mari hi partha vyapasritya
ye ‘pi syuh papa-yonayah
striyo vaisyas tatha sadras
te ‘pi yanti param gatim
“O son of Prtha, those who take shelter in Me, though they be of lower birth—
women, vaisyas [merchants], as well as sadras [workers] —can approach the
supreme destination.”

Appreciating Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s favor, Bhavananda Raya also said,
‘Along with my home, riches, servants and five sons, | surrender myself at
Your lotus feet.

This is the process of surrender. As Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura sings:

(Saranagati


--- Page 139 ---
Text 57] The Lord’s Return to Jagannatha Puri 137
When one surrenders unto the lotus feet of the Lord, he does so with everything
in his possession —his house, his body, his mind and whatever else he possesses. If
there is any obstruction to this surrendering process, one should immediately give
it up without attachment. If one can surrender with all his family members, there
is no need to take sannyasa. However, if the surrendering process is hampered by
so-called family members, one should immediately give them up to complete the
surrendering process.

TRANSLATION
“Now that | have brought him here, | am asking him to leave. Now he can go
wherever he likes, for | am no longer responsible for him.”
PURPORT
Kala Krsnadasa was influenced and allured by nomads or gypsies, who enticed
him with women. Maya is so strong that Kala Krsnadasa left Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu’s company to join gypsy women. Even though a person may associ-
ate with Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, he can be allured by maya and leave the Lord's
company due to his slightindependence. Only one who is overwhelmed by maya
can be so unfortunate as to leave Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu's company, yet unless
one is very conscientious, the influence of maya can drag one away, even though
he be the personal assistant of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. And what to speak of
others? The Bhattatharis used to increase their numbers by using women to allure
outsiders. This is factual evidence showing that it is possible at any time to fall
down from the Lord's association. One need only misuse his little independence.
Once fallen and separated from the Supreme Personality of Godhead’s associa-
tion, one becomes a candidate for suffering in the material world. Although re-
jected by Sr Caitanya Mahaprabhu, Kala Krsnadasa was given another chance, as
the following verses relate.

After this, the other devotees— headed by Nityananda Prabhu, Jagadanan-
da, Mukunda and Damodara— began to consider a certain plan.
PURPORT
Even though a person is rejected by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the
devotees of the Lord do not reject him; therefore the Lord's devotees are more
merciful than the Lord Himself. Srila Narottama dasa Thakura thus sings, chadiya
vaisnava-seva nistara payeche keba: one cannot be relieved from material
clutches without engaging in the service of pure devotees. The Lord Himself may
sometimes be very hard, but the devotees are always kind. Thus Kala Krsnadasa
received the mercy of the four devotees mentioned above.

Svaripa Damodara also arrived the next day. He was a very intimate friend

PURPORT
Svardpa is the name of a brahmacari in Sankaracarya's disciplic succession. In
the Vedic discipline there are ten names for sannyasis, and it is customary for a
brahmacari assisting a sannyasi of the designation Tirtha or Asrama to receive the
title Svaripa. Damodara Svariipa was formerly a resident of Navadvipa, and his
name was Purusottama Acarya. When he went to Varanasi, he took sannyasa
from a sannyasi designated Tirtha. Although he received the title Svaripa in his
brahmacari stage, he did not change his name when he took sannyasa. Actually as
a sannyasi he should have been called Tirtha, but he chose to retain his original
brahmacari title as Svartpa.

sacred thread; tyaga—giving up; rapa—in the form of; yoga-patta—saffron col-

TRANSLATION

Upon accepting sannyasa, Purusottama Acarya followed the regulative
principles by giving up his tuft of hair and sacred thread, but he did not ac-
cept the saffron colored dress. Also, he did not accept a sannyasi title but
remained as a naisthika-brahmacari.

PURPORT

There are regulative principles governing the renounced order. One has to per-
form eight kinds of sraddha. One must offer oblations to one's forefathers and
perform the sacrifice of viraja-homa. Then one must cut off the tuft of hair called a
Sikha and also give up the sacred thread. These are preliminary processes in the
acceptance of sannydsa, and SvarGpa Damodara accepted all these. However,
Purusottama Acérya did not accept the saffron color, a sannyasi name or a danda.
He retained his brahmacari name. Actually Purusottama Acarya did not accept the
sannyasa order formally, but he renounced worldly life. He did not want to be dis-
turbed by the formality of the sannyasa order. He simply wanted to worship Lord
Sri Krsna without disturbance; therefore with heart and soul he took up the
renounced order but not the formalities accompanying it. Renunciation means
not doing anything but serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead, $ri Krsna.
When one acts on this platform, trying to please the Supreme Personality of God-
head, one is both a sannyasi and a yogi. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (6.1):

TRANSLATION
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu was never pleased to hear books or verses op-
posed to the conclusive statements of devotional service. The Lord did not
like hearing rasabhasa, the overlapping of transcendental mellows.
PURPORT
Bhakti-siddhanta-viruddha refers to that which is against the principle of unity
in diversity, philosophically known as acintya-bhedabheda—simultaneously one-
ness and difference. Rasabhasa may appear to be a transcendental mellow, but
actually it is not. Those who are pure Vaisnavas should avoid these things op-
posed to devotional service. These misconceptions practically parallel the
Mayavada philosophy. If one indulges in Mayavada philosophy, he gradually falls
down from the platform of devotional service. By overlapping mellows
(rasabhasa) one eventually becomes a prakrta-sahajiya and takes everything to be
very easy. One may also become a member of the baula community and gradu-
ally become attracted to material activities. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has
therefore advised us to avoid bhakti-siddhanta-viruddha and rasabhasa. In this
way the devotee can remain pure and free from falldowns. Everyone should try to
remain aloof from bhakti-siddhanta-viruddha and rasabhasa.

TRANSLATION

It was the practice for Svariipa Damodara Gosvami to examine all literatures
to find out whether their conclusions were correct. Only then would he allow
them to be heard by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.

PURPORT

Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura says that if something impedes the exe-
cution of devotional service, it should be understood to be impure. Pure devotees
of the Lord do not accept impure principles. Impure devotees accept rasabhasa, or
overlapping, contradictory mellows, and other principles opposed to the bhakti
path. The followers of such impure principles are never accepted as pure devo-
tees. There are many parties following the path of rasabhasa, and the followers are
sometimes adored by ordinary men. Those who adopt the conclusions of
rasabhasa and bhakti-siddhanta-viruddha are never accepted as devotees of Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Svariipa Damodara Gosvami never approved such
followers as Gaudiya Vaisnavas, nor did he allow them even to meet the Supreme
Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.

Svaripa Damodara was as expert a musician as the Gandharvas, and in
scriptural discussion he was just like Brhaspati, the priest of the heavenly
gods. Therefore it is to be concluded that there was no great personality quite
like Svaripa Damodara.
PURPORT
Svaripa Damodara Gosvami was very expert in music as well as Vedic scrip-
tures. 91 Caitanya Mahaprabhu used to call him Damodara because of his expert
singing and musical skills. The name Damodara was given by Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu and added to the name given by his sannyasa-guru. He was
therefore known as Svaripa Damodara, or Damodara Svaripa. He compiled a
book of music named Sarigita-damodara.

TRANSLATION

110 ocean of mercy, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu! Let there be an awakening of
Your auspicious mercy, which easily drives away all kinds of material lamenta-
tion. By Your mercy, everything is made pure and blissful. It awakens tran-
scendental bliss and covers all gross material pleasures. By Your auspicious
mercy, quarrels and disagreements arising among different scriptures are van-
quished. Your auspicious mercy causes the heart to jubilate by pouring forth
transcendental mellows. Your mercy always stimulates devotional service,
which is full of joy. You are always glorifying the conjugal love of God. May
transcendental bliss be awakened within my heart by Your causeless mercy.”

PURPORT

This important verse quoted from Sri Caitanya-candrodaya-nataka (8.10)
specifically describes the Lord's causeless mercy. Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati
Thakura explains that 511 Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who is the most magnanimous
Personality of Godhead, distributes His causeless mercy in three ways to the con-
ditioned soul. Every living entity is morose in the material world because he is al-
ways in want. He undergoes a great struggle for existence and tries to minimize
his miserable condition by squeezing the utmost pleasure out of this world.
However, the living entity is never successful in this endeavor. While in a mis-
erable condition, a person sometimes seeks the favor of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, but this is very difficult for materialistic people to obtain. However,
when one becomes Krsna conscious by the grace of the Lord, the flavor of the
lotus feet of the Lord expands, and in this way a materialist may gain freedom
from his miseries. Actually his mind is cleansed by his transcendental connection
with the lotus feet of the Lord. At such a time one is enlightened by the loving ser-
vice of the Lord.

There are many different kinds of scripture, and by reading them one often be-
comes puzzled. However, when one receives the mercy of the Lord, his confusion
is mitigated. Not only are scriptural disparities resolved, but a kind of transcenden-


--- Page 170 ---
168 $ri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 10
tal bliss is awakened, and in this way one is fully satisfied. The transcendental lov-
ing service of the Lord constantly engages the conditioned soul in serving the
Lord's lotus feet. Through such fortunate engagement, one’s transcendental love
for Krsna is increased. One's position is thus completely purified, and one is filled
with transcendental bliss accompanied by the spirit soul's jubilation.

Thus the transcendental causeless mercy of Lord Krsna is manifest in the heart
of the devotee. At such a time, material needs no longer exist. The lamentation
that invariably accompanies material desires also vanishes. By the grace of the
Lord one is elevated to the transcendental position, and then the transcendental
mellows of the spiritual world are manifest in him. One's devotional service then
becomes firm, and one engages in the Lord’s transcendental loving service with
great determination. All these combine to fully awaken the devotee’s heart with
love of Krsna.

In the beginning, a conditioned soul is bereft of Krsna consciousness and is al-
ways morose in his material activities. Later, by associating with a pure devotee,
one becomes inquisitive to know the Absolute Truth. In this way one begins to
engage in the transcendental service of the Lord.

It is by the Lord's grace that all misconceptions are vanquished and the heart
cleansed of all material dirt. It is only then that the pleasure of transcendental bliss
is awakened. By the Lord's mercy one is finally convinced of the value of devo-
tional service. When one can see the pastimes of the Lord everywhere, he is firmly
situated in transcendental bliss. Such a devotee is relieved of all kinds of material
desires, and he preaches the glories of the Lord all over the world. Krsna conscious
activities separate one from material activities and the desire for liberation. At
every step the devotee feels himself connected with the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Although such a devotee may sometimes be involved in household life,
he is untouched by material existence due to his constant engagement in devo-
tional service. Thus everyone is advised to take shelter of devotional service to
become happy and liberated.

TRANSLATION

After hearing this, Sarvabhauma Bhatticarya asked Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu, “Why did Tévara Puri keep a servant who comes from a $0013
family?”

PURPORT

Both Kasiévara and Govinda were personal servants of Tsvara Puri. After Tsvara
Puri’s demise, Kasiévara went to visit all the holy places of India. Following the or-
ders of his spiritual master, Govinda immediately went to Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu for shelter. Govinda came from a sadra family, but because he was
initiated by Tévara Puri, he was certainly a _brahmana. Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya
here asked Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu why Tévara Puri accepted a disciple from a
sadra family. According to the smirti-sastra, which gives directions for the manage-
ment of the varnasrama institution, a brahmana cannot accept a disciple from the
lower castes. In other words, a ksatriya, vaisya or sadra cannot be accepted as a


--- Page 178 ---
176 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 10
servant. If a spiritual master accepts such a person, he is contaminated. Sar-
vabhauma Bhattacarya therefore asked why Tévara Puri accepted a servant or dis-
ciple born of a sadra family.

In answer to this, 6 Caitanya Mahaprabhu replied that his spiritual master,
Tsvara Puri, was so empowered that he was as good as the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. As such, Tévara Puri was the spiritual master of the whole world. He was
not a servant to any mundane rule or regulation. An empowered spiritual master
like Tsvara Puri can bestow his mercy upon anyone, irrespective of caste or creed.
The conclusion is that an empowered spiritual master is authorized by Krsna and
should be considered to be as good as the Supreme Personality of Godhead Him-
self. That is the verdict of Visvanatha Cakravarti: saksad-dharitvena samasta-
$astraih. An authorized spiritual master is as good as Hari, the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. If Hari is free to act as He likes, the empowered spiritual master is also
free. As Hari is not subject to the criticism of mundane rules and regulations, the
spiritual master empowered by Him is also not subjected. According to Caitanya-
caritamrta (Antya-lila 7.11): krspa-sakti vina nahe tara pravartana. An authorized
spiritual master empowered by Krsna can spread the glories of the holy name of
the Lord, for he has power of attorney from the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
In the mundane world, anyone possessing his master’s power of attorney can act
on behalf of his master. Similarly, a spiritual master empowered by Krsna through
his bona fide spiritual master should be considered as good as the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead Himself. That is the meaning of siksad-dharitvena. Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu therefore describes the activities of the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead and the bona fide spiritual master as follows.

TRANSLATION
‘‘Lord Krsna's mercy is dependent only on affection. Being obliged only by
affection, Lord Krsna acts very independently.
PURPORT
Lord $ri Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is merciful, but His mercy
does not depend on mundane rules and regulations. He is dependent only on


--- Page 180 ---
178 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 10
affection and nothing else. Service to Lord Krsna can be rendered in two ways.
One can serve the Lord in affection or in veneration. When service is rendered in
affection, it is the Lord's special mercy. When service is rendered in veneration, it
is doubtful whether Krsna's mercy is actually involved. If Krsna’s mercy is there, it
is not dependent on any prescribed caste or creed. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu
wanted to inform Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya that Lord Krsna is the spiritual master
of everyone, and He does not care for mundane caste or creed. Therefore Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu cited the example of Lord Krsna’s accepting food at the
house of Vidura, who was a $0013 by birth. By the same token, Tévara Puri, an em-
powered spiritual master, could show mercy to anyone. As such, he accepted
Govinda, although the boy was born in a sadra family. When Govinda was ini-
tiated, he became a brahmana and was accepted as Tsvara 20115 personal servant.
In the Hari-bhakti-vilasa, Sri Sanatana Gosvami states that if one is initiated by a
bona fide spiritual master, he immediately becomes a brahmana. A pseudo
spiritual master cannot transform a person into a brahmana, but an authorized
spiritual master can do so. This is the verdict of sastra, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu
and all the Gosvamis.

If a guru’s servant or disciple becomes Godbrother to another disciple, they
respect one another as prabhu, or master. No one should disrespect his
Godbrother. For this reason 6 Caitanya Mahaprabhu asked Sarvabhauma Bhat-
tacarya what to do about Govinda. Govinda was the personal servant of Tsvara
Puri, अ Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s spiritual master. Tévara Puri ordered Govinda to
become 9 Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s personal servant, so what was to be done? Sr
Caitanya Mahaprabhu was therefore inquiring from Bhattacarya, an experienced
friend.

garment made of deerskin; taha dekhi’—seeing that; prabhu—5Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu; duhkha—unhappiness; paila—got; antara—within Himself.
TRANSLATION
When Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and His devotees approached him, they
saw that he was covered with a deerskin. Seeing this, Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu became very unhappy.
PURPORT
Brahmananda Bharati belonged to the Sankara-sampradaya. The title bharati in-
dicates one of the ten sannyasis in the Sankara-sampradaya. It is customary for a
person who has renounced the world to cover his body with a deerskin or the
bark of a tree. This is enjoined by Manu-sambhita. However, if a sannyasi who has
renounced the world simply wears a deerskin and does not spiritually advance, he
is simply puffed up and conceited. ऽग Caitanya Mahaprabhu did not like to see
Brahmananda Bharati wearing a deerskin.

TRANSLATION

‘Both Brahmananda and Gaurahari are moving, whereas the blackish Lord

PURPORT

Brahmananda Bharati wanted to prove that there is no difference between the
Supreme Lord and the jiva, and Caitanya Mahaprabhu wanted to prove that He
and Brahmananda Bharati were jivas. Although the jivas are Brahman, they are
many, but the Supreme Lord, the Supreme Brahman, is one. On the other hand,
Brahmananda Bharati wanted to prove that Jagannatha and Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu are one, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but to fulfill His mis-
sion, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu appeared to be moving, whereas Lord Jagannatha
appeared to be inert. However, both of them are one and the same. Thus this jolly
argument was going on. Finally, Brahmananda Bharati referred the whole matter
to Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya for a final decision.

Brahmananda Bharati continued, “The living entity is localized, whereas the

tures.
PURPORT
Brahmananda Bharati drew Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya's attention because he
wanted him to judge the argument. He then stated that Brahman, the Supreme
Lord, is all-pervading. This is confirmed by Bhagavad-gita:


--- Page 194 ---

ksetrajfiarh capi mam viddhi

“QO scion of Bharata, you should understand that | am also the knower in all
bodies, and to understand this body and its owner is called knowledge. That is My
opinion.” (Bg. 13.3)

The Supreme Personality of Godhead in His Paramatma feature is expanded
everywhere. The Brahma-samhita says, andantara-stha-paramanu-cayantara-
stham: by virtue of His all-pervasive nature, the Supreme Lord is within the uni-
verse as well as within all elements of the universe. He is even within the atom. In
this way the Supreme Lord Govinda is all-pervasive. On the other hand, the living
entities are very, very small. It is said that the living entity is one ten-thousandth of
the tip of a hair. Therefore the living entity is localized. Living entities rest on the
Brahman effulgence, the bodily rays of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION

“$ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu purified me by taking away my deerskin. This is
proof that He is all-pervasive and all-powerful and that | am subordinate to
Him.

PURPORT

Brahmananda Bharati herein asserts that Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is the
Supreme Brahman and that he is the subordinate Brahman. This is confirmed in
the Vedas: nityo nityanar cetanas cetananam. The Supreme Personality of God-
head is Brahman or Pararn Brahman, the chief of all living entities. Both the
Supreme Brahman, or the Personality of Godhead, and the living entities are per-
sons, but the Supreme Brahman is the predominator, whereas the living entities
are predominated.

PURPORT
Brahmananda Bharati admitted that when there is an argument between the
spiritual master and the disciple, the spiritual master is naturally victorious, al-


--- Page 198 ---
196 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 10
though the disciple may put forward a strong argument. In other words, it is
customary that the words of the spiritual master are more worshipable than the
words of a disciple. Under the circumstances, since Brahmananda Bharati was in
the position of a spiritual master, he emerged victorious over $f Caitanya
Mahaprabhu, who considered Himself Brahmananda Bharatt's disciple. However,
Brahmananda Bharati reversed the argument and took the position of a devotee,
admitting that Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu was the Supreme Personality of God-
head, Krsna. This means that the Lord was voluntarily defeated out of affection for
the devotee. He was defeated voluntarily because no one can defeat the
Supreme Lord. Concerning this, the words of Bhisma in Srimad-Bhagavatam are
important:
sva-nigamam apahaya mat-pratijiam
rtam adhikartum avapluto ratha-sthah
dhrta-ratha-carano ‘bhyayac caladgur
harir iva hantum ibhari gatottariyah
“Fulfilling my desire and sacrificing His own promise, He got down from the
chariot, took up its wheel, and ran toward me hurriedly, just as a lion goes to kill
an elephant. He even dropped His outer garment on the way.” (Bhag. 1.9.37)
Krsna promised not to fight in the Battle of Kuruksetra, but in order to break
Krsna's promise, Bhisma attacked Arjuna in such a vigorous way that Krsna was
obliged to take up a chariot wheel and attack Bhisma. The Lord did this to show
that His devotee was being maintained at the sacrifice of His own promise.
Brahmananda Bharati said, “Since the beginning of my life | was attached to im-
personal Brahman realization, but as soon as | saw You, | became very much at-
tached to the Personality of Godhead, Krsna.” Therefore Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu
is Lord Krsna Himself, and thus Brahmananda Bharati became His devotee.

TRANSLATION

‘“Bilvamangala Thakura abandoned his impersonal realization for the
realization of the Personality of Godhead. | now see that my condition is simi-
lar to his, for it has already changed.”

PURPORT

In his early life, Bilvamangala Thakura was an impersonalist monist, and he used
to meditate upon the impersonal Brahman effulgence. Later he became a devotee
of Lord Krsna, and his explanation for this change is given ina verse [text 178] that
is quoted in Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu. Gradually one comes to the stage of
Bhagavan realization, realization of the Supreme Person, after having attained the
lower stages of realization —impersonal Brahman realization and localized
Paramatma realization. This is described in Caitanya-candramrta (5) by Prabodha-
nanda Sarasvati:

kaivalyarh narakayate tridasa-pur akasa-puspayate
durdantendriya-kala-sarpa-patali protkhata-damstrayate
visvari ptirpa-sukhayate vidhi-mahendradis ca kitayate
yat-karunya-kataksa-vaibhava-vatarn {3171 gauram eva stamah

Kaivalya, oneness in the effulgence of Brahman, appears hellish to the devotee.

The heavenly planets, the abodes of the demigods, appear to a devotee like


--- Page 200 ---
198 $ri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 10
phantasmagoria. The yogis meditate for sense control, but for the devotee the
senses appear like serpents with broken teeth. The devotee doesn’t have to con-
trol his senses, for his senses are already engaged in the Lord's service. Conse-
quently there is no possibility that the senses will act like serpents. In the material
condition, the senses are as strong as poisonous snakes. When the teeth are
broken, the snake is no longer dangerous. The entire world is a replica of
Vaikuntha for the devotee because he has no anxiety. He sees that everything
belongs to Krsna, and he does not want to enjoy anything for himself. He does not
even aspire for the position of Lord Brahma or Indra. He simply wants to engage
everything in the service of the Lord; therefore he has no problem. He stands in
his original constitutional position. All this is possible when one receives Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s merciful glance.
In the Caitanya-candramrta there are many more verses illustrating this same
principle.
dhik kurvati ca brahma-yoga-vidusas tam gauracandrarin numah
tavad brahma-katha vimukta-padavi tavan na tiktibhavet
tavac capi visrnkhalatvam ayate no loka-veda-sthitih
tavac chastra-vidarn mithah kalakalo nana-bahir-vartmasu
Sri-caitanya-padambuja-priya-jano yavan na dig-gocarah
gauras caurah sakala-maharat ko ‘pi me tivra-viryah
A discussion of the impersonal Brahman is not very palatable to a devotee. The
so-called regulations of the sastras also appear null and void to him. There are
many people who argue over the sastras, but for a devotee such discussions are
but tumultuous roaring. By the influence of ज Caitanya Mahaprabhu, all these
problems disappear.

TRANSLATION
“Without having ecstatic love for Krsna, one cannot see Him directly.
Therefore through the mercy of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, Brahmananda
Bharati has acquired direct vision of the Lord.”
PURPORT
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu said, “You are Brahmananda Bharati, an advanced
devotee who ecstatically loves the Supreme Lord. Therefore you see Krsna every-
where, and there is no doubt about it.” Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya was a mediator
between Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and Brahmananda Bharati, and his judgment
was that an advanced devotee like Brahmananda Bharati sees Krsna by Krsna's
mercy. Krsna directly presents Himself before the vision of an advanced devotee.
Since Brahmananda Bharati was an advanced devotee, he saw Krsna in the person
of जा Caitanya Mahaprabhu. In the words of Brahma-sarnhita (5.38):
premanjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena
santah sadaiva hrdayesu vilokayanti

CHAPTER 11
The Beda-kirtana Pastimes
of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu
Bhaktinivoda Thakura summarizes the Eleventh Chapter in his Amrta-pravaha-
bhasya.

When Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya tried his best to arrange a meeting between
$ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and King Prataparudra, the Lord flatly denied his re-
quest. At this time Sri Ramananda Raya returned from his governmental post, and
he praised King Prataparudra highly in Lord Caitanya’s presence. Because of this,
the Lord became a little soft. The King also made promises to Sarvabhauma Bhat-
tacarya, who hinted how the King might meet the Lord. During Anavasara, while
Lord Jagannatha was resting for fifteen days, Se Caitanya Mahaprabhu, being un-
able to see Lord Jagannatha, went to Alalanatha. Later, when the devotees from
Bengal came to see Him, He returned to Jagannatha Puri. While Advaita Acarya
and the other devotees were coming to Jagannatha Puri, Svarapa Damodara and
Govinda, ऽ Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s two personal assistants, went to receive all
the devotees with garlands. From the roof of his palace, King Prataparudra could
see all the devotees arriving. Gopinatha Acarya stood on the roof with the King,
and, following Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya’s instructions, identified each and every
devotee. The King discussed the devotees with Gopinatha Acarya, and he men-
tioned that the devotees were accepting prasada without observing the regula-
tive principles governing pilgrimages. They accepted prasada without having
shaved, and they neglected to fast in a holy place. Nonetheless, the King arranged
residential quarters for all the devotees and saw to their prasida. $ri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu talked very happily with Vasudeva Datta and other devotees.
Haridasa Thakura also came, and due to his humble and submissive attitude, $ri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu gave him a nice solitary place near the temple. After this,
the Lord began performing sankirtana, dividing all the devotees into four divisions.
After sankirtana, all the devotees left for their residential quarters.

‘“ ‘Alas, for a person who is seriously desiring to cross the material ocean and
engage in the transcendental loving service of the Lord without material mo-

who is similarly interested is more abominable than drinking poison
willingly.” ^“


--- Page 213 ---
212 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta Madhya-lila, Ch. 11
PURPORT

This is a quotation from Sri Caitanya-candrodaya-nataka (8.23). Thus ऽत
Caitanya Mahaprabhu enunciates the principles for a sannyasi renouncing the ma-
terial world for spiritual advancement. Spiritual advancement is not meant for
magic shows and jugglery but for crossing the material world and being trans-
ferred to the spiritual world. Param param jigamisoh means desiring to go to the
other side of the material world. There is a river called Vaitarani, and on one side
of this river is the material world, and on the other side is the spiritual world. Since
the Vaitarani River is compared to a great ocean, it is named bhava-sagara, the
ocean of repeated birth and death. Spiritual life aims at stopping this repetition of
birth and death and entering into the spiritual world, where one can live eternally
cognizant and blissful.

Unfortunately, the general populace does not know anything about spiritual life
or the spiritual world. The spiritual world is mentioned in Bhagavad-gita (8.20):

paras tasmat tu bhavo ‘nyo
‘vyakto ‘vyaktat sanatanah
yah sa sarvesu bhatesu
nasyatsu na vinasyati
“Yet there is another nature, which is eternal and is transcendental to this
manifested and unmanifested matter. It is supreme and is never annihilated.
When all in this world is annihilated, that part remains as it is.”

Thus there is a spiritual nature beyond this material world, and that spiritual
nature exists eternally. Spiritual advancement means stopping material activities
and entering into spiritual activities. This is the process of bhakti-yoga. In the ma-
terial world, the via media for sense gratification is mainly a woman. One who is
seriously interested in spiritual life should strictly avoid women. A sannyasi should
never see a man or a woman for material benefit. In addition, talks with ma-
terialistic men and women are also dangerous, and they are compared to drinking
poison. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu was very strict on this point. He therefore
refused to see King Prataparudra, who was naturally always engaged in political
and economic affairs. The Lord even refused to see the King despite the request of
a personality like Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya, who was the Lord's intimate friend
and devotee.

TRANSLATION
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu said, “Although it is correct that the King is a
great devotee, he is still to be considered a venomous snake. Similarly, even
though a woman be made of wood, one becomes agitated simply by touching
her form.
PURPORT
Sri Canakya Pandita in his moral instructions has stated: tyaja durjana-sarm-
sargarn bhaja sadhu-samagamam. This means that one has to abandon the
association of materialistic people and associate with spiritually advanced people.

However qualified a materialist may be, he is no better than a venomous serpent.

Everyone knows that a snake is dangerous and poisonous, and when its hood is

decorated with jewels, it is no less poisonous or dangerous. However qualified a

materialist may be, he is no better than a snake decorated with jewels. One


--- Page 215 ---
214 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta Madhya-lila, Ch. 11
should therefore be careful in dealing with such materialists, just as one would be
careful in dealing with a bejeweled serpent.

Even though a woman be made of wood or stone, she becomes attractive
when decorated. One becomes sexually agitated even by touching the form.
Therefore one should not trust his mind, which is so fickle that it can give way to
enemies at any moment. The mind is always accompanied by six enemies —
namely, kama, krodha, mada, moha, matsarya and bhaya—that is, lust, anger,
intoxication, illusion, envy and fear. Although the mind may be merged in spiritual
consciousness, one should always be very careful in dealing with it, just as one is
careful in dealing with a snake. One should never think that his mind is trained
and that he can do whatever he likes. One interested in spiritual life should always
engage his mind in the service of the Lord so that the enemies of the mind, who
always accompany the mind, will be subdued. If the mind is not engaged in Krsna
consciousness at every moment, there is a chance that it will give way to its
enemies. In this way we become victims of the mind.

Chanting the Hare Krsna mantra engages the mind at the lotus feet of Krsna
constantly; thus the mind's enemies do not have a chance to strike. Following Ng
Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s example in these verses, we should be very careful in
dealing with the mind, which should not be indulged in any circumstance. Once
we indulge the mind, it can create havoc in this life, even though we may be
spiritually advanced. The mind is specifically agitated through the association of
materialistic men and women. Therefore Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, through His
personal behavior, warns everyone to avoid meeting a materialistic person or a
woman.

King Prataparudra requested an interview with जा = Caitanya Mahaprabhu
through the Bhattacarya, who duly submitted the request. The Lord, however, im-
mediately refused this interview. Now when Ramananda Raya informed the Lord
how eager the King was to see Him, the Lord was immediately pleased. তা
Caitanya Mahaprabhu requested Ramananda Raya to retire from his government
post and come to जा Purusottama-ksetra (Jagannatha Puri) to live with Him. When
this proposal was submitted to King Prataparudra, he immediately accepted it and
also encouraged Ramananda Raya by allowing him a full pension. This was very
much appreciated by the Lord, and this confirms the fact that the Lord is more
pleased when one serves the servant of the Lord. In ordinary parlance it is said, “If
you love me, love my dog.” To approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
one has to go through His confidential servant. This is the method. $r7 Caitanya
Mahaprabhu clearly says, “Because the King loves you, Ramananda Raya, he is
very fortunate. Krsna will certainly accept him due to his love for you.”

TRANSLATION

‘ ‘My devotees take great care and respect in rendering Me service. They
offer obeisances to Me with all their bodily limbs. They worship My devotees
and find all living entities related to Me. For Me they engage the entire energy
of their bodies. They engage the power of speech in the glorification of My
qualities and form. They also dedicate their minds unto Me and try to give up
all kinds of material desires. Thus My devotees are characterized.’

PURPORT

These two verses are quoted from Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.19.21-22). They
were spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Krsna, who was
answering Uddhava’s inquiry about devotional service.

aradhanam —worship; param —the most exalted; tasmat—and above such wor-
ship of Lord Visnu; parataram —of greater value; devi—O goddess; tadiyanam—

TRANSLATION

“Lord Siva told the goddess Durga, ‘My dear Devi, although the Vedas
recommend worship of demigods, the worship of Lord Visnu is topmost.
However, above the worship of Lord Visnu is the rendering of service to
Vaisnavas, who are related to Lord Visnu.’

PURPORT

The Vedas are divided into three divisions— karma-kanda, jAana-kanda and
updsana-kanda. These are activities dealing with fruitive work, empiric philosophi-
cal speculation and worship. There are recommendations in the Vedas for the
worship of various demigods as well as Lord Visnu. Lord Siva answers 00885
question in this quotation from Padma Purana. This verse is also included in Laghu-


--- Page 226 ---
Text 32] The Beda-kirtana Pastimes 225
bhagavatamrta (2.4) by Srila Rapa Gosvami. The words visnor aradhanam refer to
the worship of Lord Visnu, or Krsna. Thus the supreme form of worship is the
satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Sri Krsna. It is further con-
cluded that the worshiper of Lord Visnu renders better service by worshiping the
devotee of Lord Krsna. There are different types of devotees—those in the santa-
rasa, dasya-rasa, sakhya-rasa, vatsalya-rasa and madhurya-rasa. Although all the
rasas are on the transcendental platform, the madhurya-rasa is the supreme tran-
scendental mellow. Consequently it is concluded that the worship of devotees
engaged in the Lord's service in the madhurya-rasa is the supreme spiritual ac-
tivity. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and His followers mainly worship Lord Krsna in
the madhurya-rasa. Other Vaisnava dcaryas recommended worship up to the vat-
salya-rasa. Therefore Srila Rapa Gosvami in his Vidagdha-madhava (1.2) describes
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s cult as supreme:
anarpita-carim cirat karupayavatirnah kalau
samarpayitum unnatojjvala-rasam sva-bhakti-sriyam
$ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu appeared in this age of Kali to exhibit the superex-
cellence of madhurya-rasa, a gift never previously bestowed by any acarya or in-
carnation. Consequently Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is accepted as the most mag-
nanimous incarnation. It is He only who distributed love of Krsna while exhibiting
the superexcellence of loving Krsna in the conjugal rasa.

TRANSLATION

Ramananda Raya said, “The legs are like the chariot, and the heart is like
the charioteer. Wherever the heart takes the living entity, the living entity is
obliged to go.”

PURPORT
In Bhagavad-gita (18.61) Lord Krsna explains:
isvarah sarva-bhatanam
hrd-dese ‘rjuna tisthati
bhramayan sarva-bhatani
yantraradhani mayaya
“The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone's heart, O Arjuna, and is directing the
wanderings of all living entities, who are seated as on a machine made of material
energy.”

Thus the living entity wanders within this universe riding upon a chariot (the
body) bestowed by material nature. A similar explanation is given in the Katha
Upanisad (1.3.3,4):

atmanam rathinari viddhi

“The individual is the passenger in the car of the material body, and intelligence is
the driver. Mind is the driving instrument, and the senses are the horses. The self is
thus the enjoyer or sufferer in the association of the mind and senses. In this way
it is understood by great thinkers.”

Thus the living entity is the charioteer and the body the chariot offered by ma-
terial nature. The mind is the reins controlling the horses, and the senses are the
horses. Thus the living entity is the false enjoyer of the material world. One who is
advanced in Krsna consciousness can control the mind and intelligence. In other
words, he can control the reins and the horses (the senses), even though the
horses are very powerful. One who can control the senses by his mind and intelli-
gence can very easily approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or Visnu,
who is the ultimate goal of life. Tad visnoh paramanm padam sada pasyanti sarayah.
Those who are actually advanced approach Lord Visnu, their ultimate goal. Such
people are never captivated by Lord Visnu's external energy, the material world.

TRANSLATION
“Alas, has Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu incarnated to deliver all kinds of sin-
ners with the exception of a king named Maharaja Prataparudra?
PURPORT
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s mission is thus described by Narottama dasa
Thakura: patita-pavana-hetu tava avatara/ mo-sama patita prabhu na paibe ara. If
Sti Caitanya Mahaprabhu descended to reclaim sinners, then one who is the most
sinful and lowborn is the first candidate for the Lord's consideration. Maharaja Pra-
taparudra considered himself a most fallen soul because he had to deal with ma-
terial things constantly and enjoy material profits. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s busi-
ness was the deliverance of the most fallen. How, then, could He reject the King?
The more fallen a person is, the more he has the right to be delivered by the
Lord —provided, of course, he surrenders unto the Lord. Maharaja Prataparudra
was a fully surrendered soul; therefore the Lord could not refuse him on the
grounds that he was a worldly pounds-shillings man.

TRANSLATION
Maharaja Prataparudra continued, “If Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is deter-
mined not to see me, then | am determined to give up my life if | do not see
Him.
PURPORT
A devotee with Maharaja Prataparudra’s determination will certainly be vic-
torious in advancing in Krsna consciousness. Sri Krsna confirms this in Bhagavad-
gita (9.14):


--- Page 236 ---
Text 50] The Beda-kirtana Pastimes 235
satatarn kirtayanto mam
yatantas ca drdha-vratah
namasyantas ca mam bhaktya
nitya-yukta upasate
“Always chanting My glories, endeavoring with great determination, bowing
down before Me, these great souls perpetually worship Me with devotion.”
These are the symptoms of a mahatma engaged in the Lord's service in full
Krsna consciousness. Thus Maharaja Prataparudra’s determination is very exalted
and is called drdha-vrata. Because of this determination, he was finally able to
receive Lord Caitanya’s direct mercy.
TEXT 49

SYNONYMS
yadi—if; sei—that; mahaprabhura—of Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu; na—
not; pai—I get; krpa-dhana—the treasure of mercy; kiba rajya—what is the value
of my kingdom; kiba deha—what is the value of this body; saba akarana—every-
thing useless.
TRANSLATION
“1f 1 do not receive Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s mercy, my body and my
kingdom are certainly useless.”
PURPORT
This is an excellent example of drdha-vrata, determination. If one does not
receive the Supreme Personality of Godhead’s mercy, one’s life is defeated. In
Srimad-Bhagavatam (5.5.5) it is said: parabhavas tavad abodha-jato yavan na
jijidsata atma-tattvam. Unless one inquires into spiritual life, everything is useless.
Without spiritual inquiry, our labor and the object of our labor are simply a waste
of time.

eta suni’—hearing this; sarvabhauma—Sarvabhauma; ha-ila—became; cin-
tita—very thoughtful; rajara—of the King; anuraga—attachment; dekhi’—seeing;
ha-ila—became; vismita—astonished.
TRANSLATION
Hearing King Prataparudra’s determination, Sarvabhauma Bhatticarya be-
came thoughtful. Indeed, he was very astonished to see the King’s determina-
tion.
PURPORT
Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya was astonished because such determination is not
possible for a worldly man attached to material enjoyment. The King certainly had
ample opportunity for material enjoyment, but he was thinking that his kingdom
and everything else was useless if he could not see Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. This
is certainly sufficient cause for astonishment. In Srimad-Bhagavatam it is stated
that bhakti, devotional service, must be unconditional. No material impediments
can actually check the advancement of devotional service, be it executed by a
common man or a king. In any case, devotional service rendered to the Lord is al-
ways complete, despite the devotee’s material position. Devotional service is so
exalted that it can be executed by anyone in any position. One simply must be
drdha-vrata, firmly determined.

cause of your firm determination, | am sure that Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s
mercy will definitely be bestowed upon you.”


--- Page 238 ---
Text 52] The Beda-kirtana Pastimes 237
PURPORT

Due to King Prataparudra’s firm determination, Bhattacarya predicted that Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s mercy would be there without fail. As confirmed
elsewhere in Caitanya-caritamrta (Madhya, 19.151), guru-krspa-prasade paya
bhakti-lata-bija: “By the mercy of the spiritual master and Krsna, one gets the seed
of devotional service.” Bhattacarya was supposed to be the spiritual master of
King Prataparudra, and he gave his blessings to the effect that the Lord would be
merciful upon the King. The mercy of the spiritual master and Krsna combine to
grant success to a devotee engaged in Krsna consciousness. This is confirmed by
the Vedas:

yasya deve para bhaktir
yatha deva tatha gurau
tasyaite kathita hy arthah
prakasante mahatmanah
“Only unto those great souls who have implicit faith in both the Lord and the
spiritual master are all the imports of Vedic knowledge automatically revealed.”
(Svetasvatara Upanisad 6.23)

Maharaja Prataparudra had firm faith in Bhattacarya, who declared $ri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Having firm faith in Bhat-
tacarya as his spiritual master, King Pratdparudra immediately accepted Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu as the Supreme Lord. Thus he began worshiping $i
Caitanya Mahaprabhu in his mind. This is the process of devotional service. Ac-
cording to Bhagavad-gita (9.34):

man-mana bhava mad-bhakto
mad-yaji marh namaskuru
mam evaisyasi yuktvaivam
atmanarh mat-parayanah
“Engage your mind always in thinking of Me, become My devotee, offer obei-
sances and worship Me. Being completely absorbed in Me, surely you will come
to Me.”

This process is very simple. One need only be firmly convinced by the spiritual
master that Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If one decides this, he
can make further progress by thinking of Krsna, chanting of Krsna and glorifying
Him. There is then no doubt that such a fully surrendered devotee will receive the
blessings of Lord Krsna. Srila Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya explains this further.

TEXT 52

tenha——premadhina, tomara prema——gadhatara
avasya karibena krpa tomara upara
SYNONYMS
tenha—He (Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu); prema-adhina—under the control of
love; tomara prema—your love; gadha-tara—very deep; avasya—certainly;
karibena krpa—He will bestow mercy; tomara upara—upon you.
TRANSLATION
As soon as Bhattacarya saw the King's firm determination, he declared,
‘The Supreme lord is approached only by pure love. Your love for Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu is very, very deep; therefore without a doubt He will be
merciful upon you.”
PURPORT
Such determination is the first qualification. As confirmed by Rapa Gosvami
(Upadesamrta, 3): utsahan niscayad dhairyat. One must first have firm determina-
tion, firm faith. When one engages in devotional service, he must maintain this
firm determination. Then Krsna will be pleased with his service. The spiritual
master can show the path of devotional service. If the disciple follows the prin-
ciples rigidly and undeviatingly, he will certainly receive the mercy of Krsna. This is
confirmed by the sastras.

“Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu will be in a mood of ecstatic love without
external consciousness. At that time you should begin to recite those chapters
from Srimad-Bhagavatam. Then He will embrace you, knowing you to be a
pure Vaisnava.
PURPORT
A Vaisnava is always ready to help another Vaisnava progress toward realiza-
tion of the Absolute Truth. Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya could understand the King's
position as a pure Vaisnava. The King was always thinking of Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu, and Bhattacarya wanted to help him approach the Lord. A Vaisnava
is always compassionate, especially when he sees a prospective devotee very
determined (drdha-vrata). Consequently Bhattacarya was ready to help the King.

TRANSLATION
‘The Lord has already changed His mind due to Ramananda Raya’s descrip-
tion of your pure love for Him.”
PURPORT
At first the Lord did not want to see the King, but due to Bhattacarya’s and
Ramananda Raya's earnest endeavors, the Lord's mind was changed. The Lord
already declared that Krsna would be merciful upon the King due to the King's ser-
vice to the devotees. This is the process by which one can advance in Krsna con-
sciousness. First there must be the devotee’s mercy; then Krsna’s mercy will de-
scend. Yasya prasadad bhagavat-prasado/ yasyaprasadan na gatih kuto ‘pi. Our
first duty, therefore, is to satisfy the spiritual master, who can arrange for the
Lord's mercy. A common man must first begin to serve the spiritual master or the
devotee. Then, through the mercy of the devotee, the Lord will be satisfied. Un-
less one receives the dust of a devotee's lotus feet on one’s head, there is no
possibility of advancement. This is also confirmed by a statement of Prahlada
Maharaja in Srimad-Bhagavatam (7.5.32):
naisarm matis tavad urukramanghrirn
sprsaty anarthapagamo yad-arthah
mahiyasam pada-rajo ‘bhisekari
niskificananarn na vrnita yavat
Unless one approaches a pure devotee, he cannot understand the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead. Maharaja Prataparudra worshiped both Ramananda Raya
and Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya. Thus he touched the lotus feet of pure devotees
and was able thereby to approach $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.

After seeing the bathing ceremony of Lord Jagannitha, $ri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu became very happy. But when Lord Jagannatha retired after the
ceremony, Lord Caitanya became very unhappy because He could not see
Him.
PURPORT
After the bathing ceremony 01511 Jagannatha, which takes place just a fortnight
before the Ratha-yatra ceremony, the body of the Lord Jagannatha Deity is
repainted, and this takes just about a fortnight to complete. This period is called
Anavasara. There are many who visit the temple to see Lord Jagannatha regularly
every day, and for them His retirement after the bathing ceremony is unbearable.

256 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta Madhya-lila, Ch. 11
PURPORT
Narottama dasa Thakura, honoring the personal associates of Lord ऽन Caitanya
Mahaprabhu, has sung as follows (Prarthana 13):
gaurangera sangi-gane nitya-siddha kari” mane
se ydya vrajendra-suta-pasa
One who is intelligent understands that all the personal associates and devotees
of Lord उव Caitanya Mahaprabhu are ever liberated. This means that they do not
belong to this material world because they are always engaged in the devotional
service of the Lord. One who is engaged in the Lord's devotional service twenty-
four hours daily and never forgets the Lord is called nitya-siddha. Srila Rapa
Gosvami also confirms this statement:
103 yasya harer dasye
karmana manasa gira
nikhilasv apy avasthasu
jivan-muktah sa ucyate
“A person acting in the service of Krsna with body, mind, intelligence and words is
a liberated person even within the material world, although he may be engaged in
many so-called material activites.” (Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu, 1.2.187)

A devotee is always thinking of how better to serve Lord Krsna, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, and how to broadcast His name, fame and qualities
throughout the world. One who is nitya-siddha has no business other than broad-
casting the glories of the Lord all over the world according to his ability. Such
people are already associates of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Therefore Narottama
dasa Thakura says, nitya-siddha kari” mane. One should not think that because 57
Caitanya Mahaprabhu was personally present five hundred years ago, only His
associates were liberated. Rather, Srila Narottama dasa Thakura says that anyone
is a nitya-siddha if he acts on behalf 00511 Caitanya Mahaprabhu by spreading the
glories of the holy name of the Lord. We should respect those devotees preaching
the glories of the Lord as nitya-siddha and should not consider them conditioned.

SYNONYMS

koti-sarya-sama—equal to the shining of millions of suns; saba—all of them;

madhura kirtana—such melodious performance of congregational chanting.

TRANSLATION

“Indeed, their effulgence is like the brilliance of a million suns. Nor have ॥

ever heard the Lord’s names chanted so melodiously.
PURPORT

Such are the symptoms of pure devotees when they are chanting. All the pure
devotees are as bright as sunshine, and their bodily luster is very effulgent. In addi-
tion, their performance of sarikirtana is unparalleled. There are many professional
chanters who can perform congregational chanting with various musical instru-
ments in an artistic and musical way, but their chanting cannot be as attractive as
the congregational chanting of pure devotees. If a devotee sticks strictly to the
principles governing Vaisnava behavior, his bodily luster will naturally be attrac-
tive, and his singing and chanting of the holy names of the Lord will be effective.
People will appreciate such kirtana without hesitation. Even dramas about the
pastimes of Lord Caitanya or Sri Krsna should be played by devotees. Such dramas
will immediately interest an audience and be full of potency. The students of the
International Society for Krishna Consciousness should note these two points and
try to apply these principles in their spreading of the Lord's glories.

dhvani—such vibration of the chanting of the holy name; kaharn—anywhere;

TRANSLATION
| have never before seen such ecstatic love, nor heard the vibration of the

sankirtana.”
PURPORT
Because the temple of Lord Jagannatha is situated at Jagannatha Puri, many
devotees from all parts of the world came to perform sankirtana in glorification of
the Lord. All these devotees were certainly seen and heard by Maharaja Pra-
taparudra, but he herein admits that the kirtana performed by the associates of
the Lord was unique. He had never before heard such sarikirtana nor seen such at-
tractive features manifest by the devotees. The members of the International
Society for Krishna Consciousness should go to India during the birthday
ceremony of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu at Mayapur and perform sarikirtana con-
gregationally. This will attract the attention of all the important personalities in
India, just as the beauty, bodily luster and sankirtana performance by the associ-
ates of जा Caitanya Mahaprabhu attracted the attention of Maharaja Prataparudra.
The associates of जा Caitanya Mahaprabhu were unlimited during the Lord's pres-
ence on this planet, but anyone who is pure in life and devoted to the mission of
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is to be understood as a nitya-siddha associate of the
Lord.

TRANSLATION
‘“Anyone who worships Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu by congregational
chanting should be understood to be very intelligent. One who does not do so
must be considered a victim of this age and bereft of all intelligence.
PURPORT
Rascals propose that anyone can invent his own religious process, and this
proposition is condemned herein. If one actually wants to become religious, he
must take up the chanting of the Hare Krsna maha-mantra. The real meaning of
religion is stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (6.3.19-22).

The purport of these verses is that dharma, or religion, cannot be manufactured
by a human being. Religion is the law or code of the Lord. Consequently religion
cannot be manufactured even by great saintly persons, demigods or siddha-
mukhyas, and what to speak of asuras, human beings, Vidyadharas, Caranas, and
so on. The principles of dharma, religion, come down in the parampara system
beginning with twelve personalities—namely, Lord Brahma; the great saint
Narada; Lord Siva; the four Kumaras; Kapila, the son of Devahati; Svayambhuva
Manu; Prahlada Maharaja; King Janaka; grandfather Bhisma; Bali Maharaja;
Sukadeva Gosvami; and Yamaraja. The principles of religion are known to these
twelve personalities. Dharma refers to the religious principles by which one can


--- Page 264 ---
Text 100] The Beda-kirtana Pastimes 263
understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Dharma is very confidential, un-
contaminated by all material influence, and very difficult for ordinary men to
understand. However, if one actually understands dharma, he immediately be-
comes liberated and is transferred to the kingdom of Cod. Bhagavata-dharma, or
the principle of religion enunciated by the parampara system, is the supreme prin-
ciple of religion. In other words, dharma refers to the science of bhakti-yoga,
which begins by the novice’s chanting the holy name of the Lord (tan-nama-
grahanadibhih).

In this age of Kali it is recommended in Caitanya-caritamrta, kali-kale dharma—
—krsna-nama-sankirtana. In the age of Kali the chanting of the holy name of the
Lord is the method of religion approved by all Vedic scriptures. In the next text of
this Caitanya-caritamrta, from Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.5.32), it is furtherstressed.

TRANSLATION

^“ “In the age of Kali, intelligent persons perform congregational chanting to
worship the incarnation of Godhead who constantly sings the name of Krsna.
Although His complexion is not blackish, He is Krsna Himself. He is accom-
panied by His associates, servants, weapons and confidential companions.’ /*

TRANSLATION
Bhattacarya replied, “Only a person who has received but a small fraction
of mercy from the Lord can understand that Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is
Krsna. No one else can.
PURPORT
The sankirtana movement can be spread by a person who is especially favored
by Lord Krsna (krspa-sakti vina nahe tara pravartana). Without first obtaining the


--- Page 266 ---
Text 103] The Beda-kirtana Pastimes 265
mercy of the Lord, one cannot spread the holy name of the Lord. One who can
spread the Lord's name is called labdha-caitanya in the words of Bhaktisiddhanta
Sarasavti. The labdha-caitanya is one who has actually awakened his original con-
sciousness, Krsna consciousness. The influence of the pure devotees in Krsna con-
sciousness is such that it can awaken others to become immediately Krsna con-
scious and engage themselves in the transcendental loving service of Krsna. In this
way the descendants of pure devotees increase, and Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu
takes much pleasure in seeing the increase of His devotees. The word su-
medhasah means “sharply intelligent.” When one’s intelligence is sharp, he can in-
crease the interests of common men in loving Caitanya Mahaprabhu and through
Him in loving Radha-Krsna. Those not interested in understanding Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu are simply material in their attempts at professional chanting and
dancing for money, despite their supposed artistry. If one does not have full faith
in ऽ Caitanya Mahaprabhu, he cannot properly chant and dance in the sankirtana
movement. Artificial chanting and dancing may be due to sentiments or senti-
mental agitation, but this cannot help one advance in Krsna consciousness.

seeing; sunileha—even by listening; tanre —Him; isvara—as the Supreme Per-
sonality of Codhead; na mane —does not accept.

TRANSLATION

“If the mercy of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is not bestowed upon a person —
regardless of how learned a scholar that person may be and regardless of his
seeing or listening —he cannot accept the Lord as the Supreme Personality of
Godhead.

PURPORT

The same principles can be applied to demoniac persons, even though they be
in the sampradaya of Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Without receiving the Lord's
special power, one cannot preach His glories all over the world. Even though one

may celebrate himself as a learned follower of जा Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and even
though one may attempt to preach the holy name of the Lord all over the world, if
he is not favored by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu he will find fault with the pure
devotee and will not be able to understand how a preacher is empowered by
Lord Caitanya. One must be considered bereft of the mercy of Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu when he criticizes the Krsna consciousness movement now spread-
ing all over the world or finds fault with this movement or the leader of the move-
ment.

TRANSLATION
Bhattacarya told the King, “What you have said is right according to the
regulative principles governing the visiting of holy places, but there is another
path, which is the path of spontaneous love. According to those principles,
there are subtle intricacies involved in the execution of religious principles.
PURPORT
According to the Vedic regulative principles, one has to be celibate before en-
tering a holy place of pilgrimage. Generally people are very much addicted to
sense gratification, and unless they have sex at night, they cannot sleep. The
regulative principles therefore enjoin that before a common man goes to a holy
place of pilgrimage, he should observe complete celibacy. As soon as one enters a
holy place, he must observe fasting for the day, and after shaving his head clean,
he must take a bath in a river or ocean near the holy place. These methods are
adopted to neutralize the effects of sinful activities. Visiting a holy place of
pilgrimage means neutralizing the reactions of a sinful life. Those who go to holy
places of pilgrimage actually unload the reactions of their sinful lives, and conse-
quently holy places are overloaded with sinful activities left there by visitors.
When a saintly person or pure devotee visits such a holy place, he absorbs the
sinful effects left by the common man and again purifies the holy place. Tirthi-kur-
vanti tirthani (Bhag. 1.13.10). Therefore a common man's visit to a holy place and
an exalted saintly person's visit there are different. The common man leaves his
sins in the holy place, and a saintly person or devotee cleanses these sins simply
by his presence. The devotees of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu were not common
men, and they could not be subjected to the rules and regulations governing the
visiting of holy places. Rather, they exhibited their spontaneous love for Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Immediately upon arrival at the holy place, they went to

Text 114] The Beda-kirtana Pastimes 271
see Lord Caitanya, and by His order they took maha-prasada without following
the regulations governing holy places.

yvanre—in whomever; krpa—mercy; kari’—bestowing; karena—does;
hrdaye—in the heart; prerana—inspiration; krspna-asraya—shelter of Lord Krsna;
haya—there is; chade—he gives up; veda—Vedic principles; loka-dharma—
social etiquette.
TRANSLATION
“The man to whom the Lord shows His mercy by inspiring him within the
heart takes shelter only of Lord Krsna and abandons all Vedic and social
customs.
PURPORT
This is also the teaching of Bhagavad-gita:
sarva-dharman parityajya
mam ekam sarapam vraja
aham tvam sarva-papebhyo
moksayisyami ma sucah
“Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. 1 shall deliver you
from all sinful reaction. Do not fear.” Bg. 18.66) Such firm faith in the Supreme
Personality of Godhead is possible only by the mercy of the Lord. The Lord is sit-
ting within everyone's heart, and when He personally inspires His devotee, the
devotee does not stick to the Vedic principles or social customs but rather
devotes himself to the transcendental loving service of the Lord. This is confirmed
in the following verse from Srimad-Bhagavatam (4.29.47).

SYNONYMS

one’s heart; sah—that person; jahati—gives up; matim—attention; loke—to

TRANSLATION
‘ “When one is inspired by the Lord, who is sitting in everyone's heart, he
does not care for social custom or Vedic regulative principles.’ ^
PURPORT
This instruction was given by Narada Gosvami to King Pracinabarhi in connec-
tion with the story of Purafijana. Without the mercy of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, one cannot extricate himself from the fruitive activities that are under
the jurisdiction of the Vedas. Even personalities like Lord Brahma, Lord Siva, Manu,
the Prajapatis headed by Daksa, the four Kumaras, Marici and even Narada himself
could not properly receive the causeless mercy of the Lord.

‘“O my Lord! O unlimited one! Although | was merged in the ocean of ne-
science, | have now, after a long time, attained You, just as one may attain the
seashore. My dear Lord, by getting me, You have obtained the right person
upon whom to bestow Your causeless mercy.”

PURPORT

This is a verse composed by Alabandaru Yamunacarya. One's relationship with
the Supreme Personality of Godhead may be reestablished even after one has
fallen into the ocean of nescience, which is the ocean of material existence in-
volving the repetition of birth, death, old age and disease, all arising out of the ac-
ceptance of the material body. There are 8,400,000 species of material life, but in
the human body one attains a chance to get release from the repetition of birth
and death. When one becomes the Lord's devotee, he is rescued from this

Text 153] The Beda-kirtana Pastimes 289
dangerous ocean of birth and death. The Lord is always prepared to show His
mercy upon fallen souls struggling against miserable material conditions. As stated
in Bhagavad-gita:
mamaivariso jiva-loke
jiva-bhatah sanatanah
manah-sasthanindriyani
prakrti-sthani karsati
“The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental parts. Due
to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which in-
clude the mind.” (Bg. 15.7)

Thus every living being is struggling hard in this material nature. Actually the liv-
ing entity is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, and when he surrenders unto
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he attains release from the ocean of birth
and death. The Lord, being very kind to fallen souls, is always anxious to get the
living entity out of the ocean of nescience. If the living entity understands his
position and surrenders to the Lord, his life becomes successful.

SYNONYMS

haridasa kahe —Haridasa Thakura said; mu#fi—I; nica-jati—low caste; chara—
abominable; mandira-nikate—near the temple; yaite —to go; mora—my; nahi—
there is not; adhikara—authority.

TRANSLATION

Haridasa Thakura replied, “I cannot go near the temple because | am a low-

caste abominable person. | have no authority to go there.”
PURPORT

Although Haridasa Thakura was such a highly exalted Vaisnava that he was ad-
dressed as Haridasa Gosvami, he still did not like to disturb the common sense of
the general populace. Haridasa Thakura was so exalted that he was addressed as
thakura and gosani, and these titles are offered to the most advanced Vaisnavas.
The spiritual master is generally called gosani, and thakura is used to address the
paramahamsas, those in the topmost rank of spirituality. Nonetheless Haridasa
Thakura did not want to go near the temple, although he was called there by ऽ
Caitanya Mahaprabhu Himself. The Jagannatha temple still accepts only those
Hindus who are in the varnasrama order. Other castes, especially those who are
not Hindu, are not allowed to enter the temple. This is a long-standing regulation
and thus Haridasa Thakura, although certainly competent and qualified to enter
the temple, did not want even to go near it. This is called Vaisnava humility.

TRANSLATION

‘’Please give that room to Me, for | have need for it. Indeed, | shall remem-

ber the lotus feet of the Lord sitting in that solitary place.”
PURPORT

This statement of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is significant. Nibhrte vasiya tahan
kariba smarana: “| shall sit down there in that solitary place and remember the
lotus feet of the Lord.” Neophyte students are not to imitate sitting in a solitary
place and remembering the lotus feet of the Lord by chanting the Hare Krsna
maha-mantra. We should always remember that it was ৩11 Caitanya Mahaprabhu
Himself who wanted such a place, either for Himself or Haridasa Thakura. No one
can suddenly attain the level of Haridasa Thakura and sit down in a solitary place
to chant the Hare Krsna maha-mantra and remember the lotus feet of the Lord.
Only an exalted person like Haridasa Thakura or $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who is
personally exhibiting the proper behavior for an acarya, can engage in such a prac-
tice.

At the present moment we see that some of the members of the International
Society for Krishna Consciousness are tending to leave their preaching activities in
order to sit in a solitary place. This is not a very good sign. It is a fact that Srila
Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura has condemned this process for neophytes. He
has even stated in a song: pratisthara tare, nirjanera ghare, tava hari-nama kevala
kaitava. Sitting in a solitary place intending to chant the Hare Krsna maha-mantra is
considered a cheating process. This practice is not possible for neophytes at all.
The neophyte devotee must act and work very laboriously under the direction of
the spiritual master, and he must thus preach the cult of $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.
Only after maturing in devotion can he sit down in a solitary place to chant the
Hare Krsna maha-mantra as Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu Himself did. Although Sr
Caitanya Mahaprabhu is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He nonetheless
traveled all over India continuously for six years and then retired at Jagannatha
Puri to teach us a lesson. Even at Jagannatha Puri the Lord chanted the Hare Krsna
maha-mantra in a great meeting at the Jagannatha temple. The point is that one
should not try to imitate Haridasa Thakura at the beginning of one’s transcenden-
tal life. One must first become very mature in devotion and thus receive the ap-


--- Page 302 ---
Text 178] The Beda-kirtana Pastimes 301
proval of आ Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Only at such a time may one actually sit down
peacefully in a solitary place to chant the Hare Krsna maha-mantra and remember
the lotus feet of the Lord. The senses are very strong, and if a neophyte devotee
imitates Haridasa Thakura, his enemies (kama, krodha, lobha, moha, mada and
matsarya) will disturb and fatigue him. Instead of chanting the Hare Krsna maha-
mantra, the neophyte will simply sleep soundly. Preaching work is meant for ad-
vanced devotees, and when an advanced devotee is further elevated on the
devotional scale, he may retire to chant the Hare Krsna mantra in a solitary place.
However, if one simply imitates advanced spiritual life, he will fall down, just like
the sahajiyasin Vrndavana.

306 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 11
PURPORT

The Mayavadi philosophers say that the living entity and the Supreme Lord are
nondifferent, and therefore they equate the transformation of the living entity
with the transformation of the Lord. In other words, Mayavadis say that if the liv-
ing entity is pleased, the Lord is also pleased, and if the living entity is displeased,
the Lord is also displeased. By juggling words in this way, Mayavadis try to prove
that there is no difference between the living entity and the Lord. This, however,
is not a fact. In this verse Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami explains: prabhu-gune
bhrtya vikala, prabhu bhrtya-gune. The Lord and the living entity are not equal, for
the Lord is always the master, and the living entity is always the servant. Transfor-
mation takes place due to transcendental qualities, and it is thus said that the ser-
vant of the Lord is the heart of the Lord, and the Lord is the heart of the servant.
This is also explained in Bhagavad-gita:

ye yatha marn prapadyante
tars tathaiva bhajamy aham
mama vartmanuvartante
manusyah partha sarvasah
“All of them —as they surrender unto Me —I reward accordingly. Everyone follows
My path in all respects, O son of Prtha.” (Bg. 4.11)

The Lord is always eager to congratulate the servant because of the servant's
transcendental quality. The servant pleasingly renders service unto the Lord, and
the Lord also very pleasingly reciprocates, rendering even more than the servant.

prabhu kahe —the Lord said; toma sparsi—I touch you; pavitra ha-ite —just to

nahika—is not; amate—in Me.

TRANSLATION

The Lord said, “| wish to touch you just to be purified, for your purified ac-
tivities do not exist in Me.”’

PURPORT

This is an example of the reciprocation of feelings between master and servant.
The servant thinks that he is most impure and that the master should not touch
him, and the master thinks that because He has become impure by associating
with so many impure living entities, He should touch a pure devotee like Haridasa
Thakura just to purify Himself. Actually both the servant and the master are
already purified because neither of them is in touch with the impurities of material
existence. They are already equal in quality because both of them are the purest.
There is a difference in quantity, however, because the master is unlimited and
the servant is limited. Consequently the servant always remains subordinate to
the master, and this relationship is eternal and undisturbed. As soon as the servant
feels like becoming the master, he falls into maya. Thus it is by misuse of free will
that one falls under the influence of maya.

The Mayavadi philosophers try to explain the equality of master and servant in
terms of quantity, but they fail to explain why, if the master and servant are equal,
the servant falls victim of maya. They try to explain that when the servant, the liv-
ing entity, is out of the clutches of maya, he immediately becomes the so-called
master again. Such an explanation is never satisfactory. Being unlimited, the
master cannot become a victim of maya, for in such a case His unlimitedness is
crippled or limited. Thus the Mayavada explanation is not correct. The fact is that
the master is always master and unlimited, and the servant, being limited, is some-
times curtailed by the influence of maya. Maya is also the master’s energy and is
also unlimited; therefore the limited servant or limited living entity is forced to
remain under the master or the master’s potency, maya. Being freed from maya’s


--- Page 309 ---
308 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 11
influence, one can again become a pure servant and equal qualitatively to the
Lord. The relationship between master and servant continues due to their being
unlimited and limited respectively.

TRANSLATION
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu then recited the following verse: ^“ ‘My dear Lord,
one who always keeps Your holy name on his tongue becomes greater than an
initiated brahmana. Although he may be born in a family of dog-eaters and
therefore by material calculation may be the lowest among men, he is still
glorious. This is the wonderful effect of chanting the holy name of the Lord. It
is therefore concluded that one who chants the holy name of the Lord should
be understood to have performed all kinds of austerities and great sacrifices
mentioned in the Vedas. He has already taken his bath in all the holy places of
pilgrimage. He has studied all the Vedas, and he is actually an Aryan.’ ”
PURPORT
The word Aryan means advanced. Unless one is spiritually advanced, he cannot
be called an Aryan, and this is the difference between Aryan and non-Aryan. Non-
Aryans are those who are not spiritually advanced. By following the Vedic culture,
by performing great sacrifices and by becoming a strict follower of the Vedic in-
structions, one may become a brahmana, a sannyasi or an Aryan. It is not possible
to become a brahmana, sannyasi or Aryan without being properly qualified.


--- Page 311 ---
310 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 11
Bhagavata-dharma never allows one to become a cheap brahmana, sannyasi or
Aryan. The qualities or qualifications described herein are quoted from Srimad-
Bhagavatam (3.33.7) and were spoken by Devahiti, the mother of Kapiladeva,
when she understood the influence of devotional service (bhakti-yoga). In this
way Devahati praised the devotee, pointing out his greatness in all respects.

TRANSLATION

‘Remain here peacefully and look at the cakra on the top of the temple and

PURPORT

Since he was born in a Mohammedan family, Srila Haridasa Thakura could not
enter the temple of Jagannatha due to temple restrictions. Nonetheless, he was
recognized by Sr Caitanya Mahaprabhu 25 Namacarya Haridasa Thakura. Haridasa
Thakura, however, considered himself unfit to enter the Jagannatha temple. Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu could have personally taken Haridasa Thakura in the Jagan-
natha temple if He wished, but the Lord did not like to disturb a popular custom.
Consequently the Lord asked His servant simply to look at the Visnu wheel on top
of the temple and offer obeisances (namaskara). This means that if one is not
allowed to enter the temple, or if he thinks himself unfit to enter the temple, he
can look at the wheel from outside the temple, and that is as good as seeing the
Deity within.

Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu promised to come daily to see Srila Haridasa Thakura,
and this indicates that Srila Haridasa Thakura was so advanced in spiritual life that,
although considered unfit to enter the temple, he was being personally visited by
the Lord every day. Nor was there any need for his going outside his residence to
collect food. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu assured Haridasa Thakura that the rem-
nants of His foodstuffs would be sent there. Yoga-ksemarm vahamy aham
(Bg. 9.22). As stated in Bhagavad-gita, the Lord arranges all life’s necessities for His
devotees.

One reference is made here for those who are very anxious to imitate the
behavior of Thakura Haridasa in an unnatural way. One must receive the order of


--- Page 313 ---
312 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 11
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu or His representative before adopting such a way of life.
The duty of a pure devotee or a servant of the Lord is to carry out the order of the
Lord. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu asked Nityananda Prabhu to go to Bengal and
preach, and He asked the Gosvamis, Rapa and Sanatana, to go to Vrndavana and
excavate the lost places of pilgrimage. In this case the Lord asked Haridasa
Thakura to remain there at Jagannatha Puri and constantly chant the holy names
of the Lord. Thus Sr Caitanya Mahaprabhu gave different persons different orders,
and consequently one should not try to imitate the behavior of Haridasa Thakura
without being ordered by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu or His representative. Srila
Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura condemns such imitations in this way:
dusta mana! tumi kisera vaispava?
pratisthara tare, nirjanera ghare,
tava hari-nama kevala kaitava
“My dear mind, you are trying to imitate Haridasa Thakura and chant the Hare
Krsna mantra in a secluded place, but you are not worth being called a Vaisnava
because what you want is cheap popularity and not the actual qualifications of
Haridasa Thakura. If you try to imitate him you will fall down, for your neophyte
position will cause you to think of women and money. Thus you will fall into the
clutches of maya, and your so-called chanting in a secluded place will bring about
your downfall.”

SYNONYMS

pariya—filling up to the throat; madhye madhye —occasionally; hari—the holy

TRANSLATION
They ate all kinds of cakes and sweet rice, filling themselves up to their
throats, and at intervals they vibrated the holy name of the Lord in great
jubilation.
PURPORT
It is the practice of Vaisnavas while taking prasada to chant the holy name of
Lord Hari at intervals and also sing various songs, such as sarira avidya-jala. Those
who are honoring prasada, accepting the remnants of food offered to the Deity,
must always remember that prasada is not ordinary food. Prasada is transcenden-
tal. We are therefore reminded:
maha-prasade govinde
nama-brahmani vaispave
svalpa-punya-vatam rajan
visvaso naiva jayate


--- Page 320 ---
Text 211] The Beda-kirtana Pastimes 319
Those who are not pious cannot understand the value of maha-prasada and the
holy name of the Lord. Both prasada and the Lord's name are on the Brahman or
spiritual platform. One should never consider prasada to be like ordinary hotel
cooking. Nor should one touch any kind of food not offered to the Deity. Every
Vaisnava strictly follows this principle and does not accept any food that is not
prasada. One should take prasada with great faith and should chant the holy
name of the Lord and worship the Deity in the temple, always remembering that
the Deity, maha-prasada and the holy name do not belong to the mundane plat-
form. By worshiping the Deity, eating prasada and chanting the Hare Krsna maha-
mantra, one can always remain on the spiritual platform (brahma-bhayaya kal-
pate).

Madhya-lila (the middle period), the
longest of the three, is a detailed narration of
Sri Caitanya’s extensive and eventful travels
throughout India as a renounced mendicant,
teacher, philosopher, spiritual preceptor and
mystic. Finally, Antya-i/ila (the final period)
concerns the last eighteen years of Caitanya
Mahaprabhu’s manifest presence, spent in
semiseclusion in Jagannatha Puri, Orissa.
During these final years, Sri Caitanya drifted
deeper and deeper into trances of spiritual
ecstasy unparalleled in all of religious and
literary history, Eastern or Western.

, Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami, the author of
Sri Caitanya-caritamrta, was a great saint and
a confidential disciple and student of
Raghunatha dasa Gosvami, the renowned
ascetic saint who was one of the most inti-
mate disciples of Sri Caitanya. He com-
menced work on the text while in his late
nineties and in failing health, as he vividly
describes in the text itself: “| have now be-
come too old and disturbed in invalidity.
While writing, my hands tremble. | cannot
remember anything, nor can | see or hear
properly. Still ॥ write, and this is a great
wonder.” That he nevertheless completed,
under such debilitating conditions, the
greatest literary gem of medieval India is
surely one of the wonders of literary history.

The English translation and commentary is
the work of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhakti-
vedanta Swami Prabhupada, the world’s
most distinguished scholar and teacher of
Indian religious and philosophical thought.
He himself is a disciplic descendant of 57
Caitanya, and his intimate familiarity with
the precepts of Caitanya Mahaprabhu emi-
nently qualifies him to present this impor-
tant classic to the English-speaking world.
The ease and clarity with which he ex-
pounds upon ও Caitanya’s precepts lures
even a reader totally unfamiliar with Indian
religious tradition into a genuine under-
standing and appreciation of this profound
and monumental work.

The entire text, with commentary, pre-
sented in seventeen lavishly illustrated
volumes by the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust,
represents a contribution of major impor-
tance to the intellectual, cultural and
spiritual life of contemporary man.
