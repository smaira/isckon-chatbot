Introduction

Sri Caitanya-caritamrta is the principal work on the life and teachings of इत
Krsna Caitanya. $ri Caitanya is the pioneer of a great social and religious move-
ment which began in India a little less than five hundred years ago and which has
directly and indirectly influenced the subsequent course of religious and phi-
losophical thinking not only in India but in the recent West as well.

Caitanya Mahaprabhu is regarded as a figure of great historical significance.
However, our conventional method of historical analysis —that of seeing a man as
a product of his times—fails here. 1 Caitanya is a personality who transcends the
limited scope of historical settings.

At a time when, in the West, man was directing his explorative spirit toward
studying the structure of the physical universe and circumnavigating the world in
search of new oceans and continents, Sri Krsna Caitanya, in the East, was in-
augurating and masterminding a revolution directed inward, toward a scientific
understanding of the highest knowledge of man’s spiritual nature.

The chief historical sources for the life of $ri Krsna Caitanya are the kadacas (di-
aries) kept by Murari Gupta and Svaripa Damodara Gosvami. Murari Gupta, a
physician and close associate of Sri Caitanya's, recorded extensive notes on the
first twenty-four years of Sri Caitanya’s life, culminating in his initiation into the
renounced order, sannyasa. The events of the rest of Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s for-
ty-eight years are recorded in the diary of Svaripa Damodora Gosvami, another of
Caitanya Mahaprabhu'’s intimate associates.

Sri Caitanya-caritamrta is divided into three sections called 11185, which literally
means “pastimes” — Adi-lila (the early period), Madhya-Iila (the middle period)
and Antya-lila (the final period). The notes of Murari Gupta form the basis of the
Adi-lila, and SvarGpa Damodara’s diary provides the details for the Madhya- and
Antya-lilas.

The first twelve of the seventeen chapters of Adi-lila constitute the preface for
the entire work. By referring to Vedic scriptural evidence, this preface establishes
Sri Caitanya as the avatara (incarnation) of Krsna (God) for the age of Kali—the
current epoch, beginning five thousand years ago and characterized by material-
ism, hypocrisy and dissension. In these descriptions, Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who
is identical with Lord Krsna, descends to liberally grant pure love of God to the
fallen souls of this degraded age by propagating sankirtana—literally,
“congregational glorification of God” —especially by organizing massive public
chanting of the maha-mantra (Great Chant for Deliverance). The esoteric purpose
of Lord Caitanya’s appearance in the world is revealed, his co-avataras and prin-
cipal devotees are described and his teachings are summarized. The remaining
portion of Adi-lili, chapters thirteen through seventeen, briefly recounts his
divine birth and his life until he accepted the renounced order. This includes his
childhood miracles, schooling, marriage and early philosophical confrontations, as
well as his organization of a widespread sankirtana movement and his civil disobe-
dience against the repression of the Mohammedan government.

Sri Caitanya-caritamrta

The subject of Madhya-lil, the longest of the three divisions, is a detailed nar-
ration of Lord Caitanya’s extensive and eventful travels throughout India as a
renounced mendicant, teacher, philosopher, spiritual preceptor and mystic. Dur-
ing this period of six years, 511 Caitanya transmits his teachings to his principal dis-
ciples. He debates and converts many of the most renowned philosophers and
theologians of his time, including Sankarites, Buddhists and Muslims, and incor-
porates their many thousands of followers and disciples into his own burgeoning
numbers. A dramatic account of Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s miraculous activities at
the giant Jagannatha Cart Festival in Orissa is also included in this section.

Antya-lila concerns the last eighteen years of $ri Caitanya’s manifest presence,
spent in semiseclusion near the famous Jagannatha temple at Jagannatha Puri in
Orissa. During these final years, Sri Caitanya drifted deeper and deeper into
trances of spiritual ecstasy unparalleled in all of religious and literary history,
Eastern or Western. Sri Caitanya’s perpetual and ever-increasing religious
beatitude, graphically described in the eyewitness accounts of Svaripa Damodara
Gosvami, his constant companion during this period, clearly defy the investigative
and descriptive abilities of modern psychologists and phenomenologists of
religious experience.

The author of this great classic, Krsnadasa Kavirdja Gosvami, born in the year
1507, was a disciple of Raghunatha dasa Cosvami, a confidential follower of
Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Raghunatha dasa, a renowned ascetic saint, heard and
memorized all the activities of Caitanya Mahaprabhu told to him by Svariipa
Damodara. After the passing away of ও] Caitanya and Svaripa Damodara,
Raghunatha dasa, unable to bear the pain of separation from these objects of his
complete devotion, traveled to Vrndavana, intending to commit suicide by jump-
ing from Govardhana Hill. In Vrndavana, however, he encountered Rapa Gosvami
and Sanatana Gosvami, the most confidential disciples of Caitanya Mahaprabhu.
They convinced him to give up his plan of suicide and impelled him to reveal to
them the spiritually inspiring events of Lord Caitanya’s later life. Krsnadasa Kaviraja
Cosvami was also residing in Vrndavana at this time, and Raghunatha dasa
Gosvami endowed him with a full comprehension of the transcendental life of ऽन
Caitanya.

By this time, several biographical works had already been written on the life of
Sri Caitanya by contemporary and near-contemporary scholars and devotees.
These included अ Caitanya-carita by Murari Gupta, Caitanya-marngala by Locana
dasa Thakura and Caitanya-bhagavata. This latter text, a work by Vrndavana dasa
Thakura, who was then considered the principal authority on Sri Caitanya's life,
was highly revered. While composing his important work, Vrndavana dasa, fearing
that it would become too voluminous, avoided elaborately describing many of
the events of Sr Caitanya'’s life, particulary the later ones. Anxious to hear of these
later pastimes, the devotees of Vrndavana requested Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami,
whom they respected as a great saint, to compose a book to narrate these

CHAPTER 23
Life’s Ultimate Goal —Love of Godhead

The following summary study of the Twenty-third Chapter is given by Srila Bhakti-
vinoda Thakura in his Amrta-pravaha-bhasya. In this chapter Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu describes the symptoms of emotion and love and the awakening of
one’s original loving relationship with the Lord, as well as the characteristics of a
devotee who has actually attained that stage. He then describes the gradual in-
crease of love of God up to the point of mahabhava. He then describes the five
divisions of attraction and how they continue. He also describes the mellow
derived from conjugal love, which is the supreme emotion. Conjugal love is
divided into two categories — svakiya and parakiya. Svakiya refers to loving affairs
between husband and wife, and parakiya refers to loving affairs between two
lovers. There are a number of descriptions in this connection. There is also a de-
scription of the sixty-four transcendental qualities of Krsna. Srimati Radharani has
twenty-five transcendental qualities.

Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu then describes those candidates who are eligible to
taste the mellows of devotional service. Their fundamental natures and their
varieties are also described. The Lord also informs Sanatana Gosvami about all the
confidential paraphernalia of devotional service. He gives a description of Goloka
Vrndavana, where the Lord is engaged in His eternal pastimes described in the
Hari-varisa. There is also an opposing and favorable description of kesa-avatara.
All these instructions are mentioned herein.

In this way Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu blessed Sanatana Gosvami, placing His
own hand on his head. Thus Sanatana received the power to describe these sub-
jects in books like Hari-bhakti-vilasa.

TRANSLATION

“When that ecstatic emotional stage intensities, it is called love of God-

head. Such love is life’s ultimate goal and the reservoir of all pleasure.
PURPORT

Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura summarizes this growth of love of Godhead as a
gradual process. A person becomes interested in devotional service by some
good fortune. Eventually he becomes interested in pure devotional service with-
out material contamination. At that point, a person wants to associate with devo-
tees. As a result of this association, he becomes more and more interested in dis-
charging devotional service and hearing and chanting. The more one is interested
in hearing and chanting, the more he is purified of material contamination. Libera-
tion from material contamination is called anartha-nivrtti, indicating a diminishing
of all unwanted things. This is the test of development in devotional service. If
one actually develops the devotional attitude, he must be freed from the material
contamination of illicit sex, intoxication, gambling and meat-eating. These are the
preliminary symptoms. When one is freed from all material contamination, his firm
faith awakens in devotional service. When firm faith develops, a taste arises, and
by that taste, one becomes attached to devotional service. When this attachment
intensifies, the seed of love of Krsna fructifies. This position is called priti or rati
(affection) or bhava (emotion). When rati intensifies, it is called love of Godhead.
This love of Godhead is actually life's highest perfection and the reservoir of all
pleasure.

Thus devotional life is divided into two stages —sadhana-bhakti and bhava-
bhakti. Sadhana-bhakti refers to the development of devotional service through
the regulative principles. The basic principle for the execution of devotional ser-
vice is faith. Above that, there is association with devotees, and after that there is
initiation by a bona fide spiritual master. After initiation, when one follows the


--- Page 11 ---
Text 15] Life’s Ultimate Goal 9
regulative principles of devotional service, one becomes freed from all unwanted
things. In this way one becomes firmly fixed and gradually develops a taste for
devotional service. The more the taste grows, the more one desires to render ser-
vice to the Lord. In this way one becomes attached to a particular mellow in the
Lord's service —santa, dasya, sakhya, vatsalyaand madhura. As a result of such at-
tachment, bhava develops. Bhava-bhakti is the platform of purified goodness. By
such purified goodness, one’s heart melts in devotional service. Bhava-bhakti is
the first seed of love of Godhead. This emotional stage is there before one attains
pure love. When that emotional stage intensifies, it is called prema-bhakti, or
transcendental love of Godhead. This gradual process is also described in the
following two verses found in Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu (1.4.15-16).

anubhava, subordinate signs of ecstatic emotion. They are visible in a person
in whose heart the seed of love of God has begun to fructify.’

PURPORT
This is a verse from Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.19.15) spoken by Maharaja Pariksit
while he was sitting on the bank of the Ganges expecting to be bitten by a snake-
bird summoned by the curse of a brahmana boy named Sragi, who was the son of
a great sage named Samika. News of the curse was conveyed to the King, who
prepared for his imminent death. Many great saintly persons, sages, brahmanas,
kings and demigods came to see him in his last days. Maharaja Pariksit, however,
was not at all afraid of being bitten by the snake-bird. Indeed, he requested all the
great personalities assembled to continue chanting the holy name of Lord Visnu.

TRANSLATION
‘Not a moment should be lost. Every moment should be utilized for Krsna

Maharaja Pariksit’s expression of anxiety is explained in this verse. He says, “Let
whatever is destined to happen take place. It doesn’t matter. Just let me see that
not a moment of my time is wasted without a relationship with Krsna.” One has
to tolerate all obstacles on the path of Krsna consciousness, and one has to see
that not a moment of his life is wasted outside of Krsna's service.

The real symptoms of the fructification of the seed of love (rati) are manifest be-
cause the heart is melted. When such symptoms are found among speculators
and fruitive actors, they cannot be accepted as real symptoms of attachment.
Foolish people without knowledge of devotional service praise such symptoms of
attachment even when they are based on something other than a desire to serve
Krsna. However, one who is expert in devotional service calls such symptoms rati-
abhasa, a mere glimpse of attachment.

Love for Krsna, Kesava, as previously described, reaches the supreme state of
being composed of mellows when its ingredients are fulfilled. By means of
vibhava, anubhava, sattvika and vyabhicari, hearing and chanting are activated,
and the devotee is able to taste love for Krsna. Then attachment for Krsna, or per-
manent ecstasy (sthdyi-bhava), becomes the mellow of devotional service (bhak-
ti-rasa).

“The cause bringing about the tasting of love for Krsna is called vibhava. Vibhava
is divided into two categories —alambana (support) and uddipana (awakening).”

lambanoddipanatmakah
“That which causes love for Krsna to appear is called vibhava. That has two divi-

raty-ader visayatvena
tathadharatayapi ca
“The object of love is Krsna, and the container of that love is the devotee of Krsna.

bells, conchshell, the marks on His feet, His place of residence, His favorite plant
[tulasil, His devotees, and the observance of fasts and vows connected to His
devotion all awaken the symptoms of ecstatic love.”
In Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu, anubhava is described as follows:
anubhavas tu citta-stha-
bhavanam avabodhakah
te bahir vikriya prayah
prokta udbhasvarakhyaya
The many external ecstatic symptoms or bodily transformations which indicate
ecstatic emotions in the mind, and which are also called udbhasvara, are the
anubhavas, or subordinate ecstatic expressions of love. Some of these are
dancing, falling down and rolling on the ground, singing and crying very loudly,
bodily contortions, loud vibrations, yawning, deep breathing, disregard for others,
the frothing of saliva, mad laughter, spitting, hiccups and other similar
symptoms. All these symptoms are divided into two divisions —sita and ksepana.
Singing, yawning and so on are called sita. Dancing and bodily contortions are
called ksepana.
The Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu describes udbhasvara as follows:
udbhasante svadhamniti
prokta udbhasvara budhaih

32 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 23
The ecstatic symptoms manifest in the external body of a person in ecstatic love
are called by learned scholars udbhasvara. Some of these are a slackening of the
belt and a dropping of clothes and hair. Others are bodily contortions, yawning, a
trembling of the front portion of the nostrils, heavy breathing, hiccupping and
falling down and rolling on the ground. These are the external manifestations of
emotional love. Stambha and other symptoms are described in Madhya-lila
(14.167).

There are thirty-three transitory elements known as vyabhicari—ecstatic emo-
tions. They especially wander about the permanent sentiments as assistants. They
are to be known by words, by different symptoms seen in the limbs and in other
parts of the body, and by the peculiar conditions of the heart. Because they set in
motion the progress of the permanent sentiments, they are specifically called
sancari, or impelling principles. These impelling principles rise up and fall back in
the permanent sentiments of ecstatic love like waves in an ocean of ecstasy. Con-
sequently they are called vyabhicari.

of the love found in friends like Subala extends to the standard of ecstatic love
of Godhead.
PURPORT
Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura says that the mellow of neutrality in-
creases to simple love of Godhead. In the mellow of servitorship, love of Godhead
increases beyond that to affection, counter-love (anger based on love), love and
attachment. Similarly, the mellow of friendship increases to affection, counter-
love, love, attachment and subattachment. It is the same with the mellow of
paternal affection. The special feature of the mellow of friendship exhibited by
personalities like Subala is that it increases from fraternal affection to counter-
love, to spontaneous attachment, to subordinate attachment, and finally to the
ecstasy where all the ecstatic symptoms continuously exist.

“There are two divisions of each of the five mellows—yoga [connection]

PURPORT
In Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu, these divisions are described:
ayoga-yogavetasya
prabhedau kathitav ubhau
In the mellows of bhakti-yoga, there are two stages—ayoga and yoga. Ayoga is
described in Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu:
sangabhavo harer dhirair
ayoga iti kathyate
ayoge tvan-manaskatvam
tad-gunady-anusandhayah
tat-prapty-updya-cintadyah
sarvesarn kathitah kriyah

Learned scholars in the science of bhakti-yoga say that when there is an absence

of association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, separation takes place.

In the stage of ayoga (separation), the mind is filled with Krsna consciousness and

is fully absorbed in thoughts of Krsna. In that stage, the devotee searches out the

transcendental qualities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is said that in
that stage of separation, all the devotees in the different mellows are always ac-
tive in thinking of ways to attain Krsna’s association.
The word yoga (connection) is thus described:
krsnena sangamo yas tu
sa yoga iti kirtyate


--- Page 38 ---
36 $ri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 23
“When one meets Krsna directly, that is called yoga.”

In the transcendental mellows of neutrality and servitorship, there are similar
divisions of yoga and viyoga, but they are not variegated. The divisions of yoga
and viyoga are always existing in the five mellows. However, in the transcen-
dental mellows of friendship and paternal affection, there are many varieties of
yoga and viyoga. The varieties of yoga are thus described:

yogo ‘pi kathitah siddhis
tustih sthitir iti tridha
Yoga (connection) is of three types —success, satisfaction and permanence. The
divisions of ayoga (separation) are thus described:
utkanthitarm viyogas cety
ayogo {21 dvidhocyate
Thus ayoga has two divisions —longing and separation.

--- Page 42 ---
40 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 23
When the lover and the beloved meet, they are called yukta (connected). Pre-
vious to their meeting, they are called ayukta (not connected). Whether con-
nected or not connected, the ecstatic emotion arising due to not being able to
embrace and kiss each other as desired is called vipralambha. This vipralambha
helps nourish emotions at the time of meeting. Similarly, sambhoga is thus de-
scribed:
darsanalinganadinam
anukalyan nisevaya
yanor ullasam arohan
bhavah sambhoga iryate
“Meeting each other and embracing each other are aimed at bringing about the
happiness of both the lover and the beloved. When this stage becomes in-
creasingly jubilant, the resultant ecstatic emotion is called sambhoga.” When
awakened, sambhoga is divided into four categories:
(1) parva-raga-anantara—after parva-raga (attachment prior to meeting),
sambhoga is called brief (sanksipta);
(2) mana-anantara—after mana (anger based on love), sambhoga is called
encroached (sankirpa);
(3) kincid-dara-pravasa-anantara—after being a little distance away for some
time, sambhoga is called accomplished (sampanna);
(4) suddra-pravasa-anantara—after being far away, sambhoga is called perfec-
tion (samrddhiman).
The meetings of the lovers that take place in dreams also have these four divi-
sions.

parva-ragah sa ucyate
When attachment produced in both the lover and beloved before their meeting
by seeing, hearing and so on becomes very palatable by the mixture of four ingre-
dients, such as vibhava and anubhava, this is called parva-raga.
The word mana is also described:
dampatyor bhava ekatra
sator apy anuraktayoh
svabhistaslesa-viksadi-
nirodhi mana ucyate
Mana is a word used to indicate the mood of the lover and the beloved ex-
perienced whether they are in one place or in different places. This mood
obstructs their looking at one another and embracing one another, despite the
fact that they are attached to one another.
Pravasa is also explained as follows:
parva-sariga-tayor yanor
bhaved desantaradibhih
vyavadhanari tu yat prajiaih
sa pravasa itiryate
Pravasa is a word used to indicate the separation of lovers who were previously
intimately associated. This separation is due to their being in different places.
Similarly, prema-vaicittya is explained:
priyasya sannikarse ‘pi
premotkarsa-svabhavatah
ya visesa-dhiyartis tat

Prema-vaicittya is a word used to indicate an abundance of love that brings about
grief from fear of separation, although the lover is present.

yourself are not asleep or resting but are lamenting. Should | presume that

manah sasthanindriyani
prakrti-sthani karsati
“The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental parts. Due
to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which in-
clude the mind.” (Bg. 15.7)


--- Page 52 ---
50 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 23
The qualities of Krsna are present in the living entity in minute, atomic quan-
tities. A small portion of gold is certainly gold, but it cannot be equal to a gold
mine. Similarly, the living entities have all the characteristics of the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead in minute quantity, but the living entity is never equal to the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. God is therefore described as the Supreme
Being, and the living entity is described as a jiva. God is the Supreme Being, the
chief of all living beings —eko bahanam yo vidadhati kaman. The Mayavadis main-
tain that everyone is God, but even if this philosophy is accepted, no one can
maintain that everyone is equal to the Supreme Godhead. Only unintelligent men
maintain that everyone is equal to God or that everyone is God.

also present in Krsna, but they are not present in demigods like Lord Siva or in
other living entities. These are (1) inconceivable supreme power,
(2) generating innumerable universes from the body, (3) being the original
source of all incarnations, (4) bestowing salvation upon enemies killed, and
(5) the ability to attract exalted persons who are satisfied in themselves. Al-

of Krsna, these atheistic rascals do not accept Him as the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Although the Lord is described and accepted by great personalities,
acaryas and sages, the Mayavadis still do not appreciate Him. Unfortunately at the
present moment human society is so degraded that people cannot even provide
themselves with life’s daily necessities, yet they are captivated by Mayavadi phi-
losophers and are being misled. According to Bhagavad-gita, simply by under-
standing Krsna one can get free from the cycle of birth and death. Tyaktva deharn
punar janma naiti mam eti so ‘rjuna. Unfortunately this great science of Krsna con-
sciousness has been impeded by Mayavadi philosophers who are opposed to the
personality of Krsna. Those who are preaching this Krsna consciousness move-
ment must try to understand Krsna from the statements given in Bhakti-rasamrta-

TRANSLATION
‘‘Establish devotional service to Lord Krsna and Radharani in Vrndavana.

PURPORT
Sanatana Gosvami was enjoined (1) to broadcast the revealed scriptures on
devotional service and establish the conclusions of devotional service, (2) to re-
establish lost places of pilgrimage like Vrndavana and Radha-kunda, (3) to
establish the Vindavana method of temple worship and install Deities in temples
(Sri Sanatana Gosvami established Madana-mohana temple, and Rapa Gosvami
established Covindaji temple.), and (4) to enunciate the behavior of a Vaisnava
(as Srila Sanatana Gosvami did in Hari-bhakti-vilasa). In this way Sanatana
Gosvami was empowered to establish the cult of Vaisnavism. As stated by
Srinivasa Acarya:
nana-sastra-vicaranaika-nipunau sad-dharma-sarhsthapakau
lokanarn hita-karinau tribhuvane manyau saranyakarau
radha-krsna-padaravinda-bhajananandena mattalikau

“I offer my respectful obeisances unto the six Gosvamis, namely आ Sanatana
Gosvami, Sr Rapa Gosvami, Si Raghunatha Bhatta Gosvami, Sri Raghunatha dasa
Gosvami, 5 Jiva Gosvami and $ri Gopala Bhatta Gosvami, who are very expert in
scrutinizingly studying all the revealed scriptures with the aim of establishing eter-
nal religious principles for the benefit of all human beings. Thus they are honored
all over the three worlds, and they are worth taking shelter of because they are
absorbed in the mood of the gopis and are engaged in the transcendental loving
service of Radha and Krsna.”

This Krsna consciousness movement continues the tradition of the six
Gosvamis, especially Srila Sanatana Gosvami and Srila २००३ Gosvami. Serious stu-
dents of this Krsna consciousness movement must understand their great respon-
sibility to preach the cult of Vindavana (devotional service to the Lord) all over
the world. We now have a nice temple in Vrndavana, and serious students should
take advantage of it. | am very hopeful that some of our students can take up this
responsibility and render the best service to humanity by educating people in
Krsna consciousness.

yukta-vairagya-sthiti saba sikhaila
Suska-vairagya-jiana saba nisedhila
SYNONYMS
yukta-vairagya—of proper renunciation; sthiti—the situation; saba—all;
Sikhaila—instructed;  suska-vairagya—dry renunciation; jAana—speculative
knowledge; saba—all; nisedhila—forbade.
TRANSLATION
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu then told Sanatana Gosvami about proper renun-
ciation according to a particular situation, and the Lord forbade dry renun-
ciation and speculative knowledge in all respects.
PURPORT
This is the technique for understanding suska-vairagya and yukta-vairagya. In
Bhagavad-gita (6.17) it is said:
yuktahara-viharasya
yukta-cestasya karmasu
yukta-svapnavabodhasya
yogo bhavati duhkha-ha
“He who is temperate in his habits of eating, sleeping, working and recreation can
mitigate all material pains by practicing the yoga system.” To broadcast the cult of
Krsna consciousness, one has to learn the possibility of renunciation in terms of
country, time and candidate. A candidate for Krsna consciousness in the Western
countries should be taught about the renunciation of material existence, but one
would teach candidates from a country like India in a different way. The teacher


--- Page 66 ---
64 $ri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 23
(acarya) has to consider time, candidate and country. He must avoid the principle
of niyamagraha—that is, he should not try to perform the impossible. What is
possible in one country may not be possible in another. The acarya’s duty is to ac-
cept the essence of devotional service. There may be a little change here and
there as far as yukta-vairagya (proper renunciation) is concerned. Dry renunciation
is forbidden by $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and we have also learned this from our
spiritual master, His Divine Grace Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura Gosvami
Maharaja. The essence of devotional service must be taken into consideration,
and not the outward paraphernalia.

Sanatana Gosvami wrote his Vaisnava 5172111, Hari-bhakti-vilasa, which was
specifically meant for India. In those days, India was more or less following the
principle of smarta-vidhi. Srila Sanatana Gosvami had to keep pace with this, and
his Hari-bhakti-vilasa was compiled with this in mind. According to smarta-
brahmanas, a person not born in a brahmana family could not be elevated to the
position of a brahmana. Sanatana Gosvami, however, says in Hari-bhakti-
vilasa (2.12) that anyone can be elevated to the position of a brahmana by the
process of initiation.

yatha kancanatam yati
kamsyarm rasa-vidhanatah
tatha diksa-vidhanena
dvijatvam jayate nrnam
There is a difference between the smarta process and the gosvami process. Ac-
cording to the smarta process, one cannot be accepted as a brahmana unless he is
born in a brahmana family. According to the gosvami process, the Hari-bhakti-
vilasa and the Narada-paricaratra, anyone can be a brahmana if he is properly ini-
tiated by a bona fide spiritual master. This is also the verdict of Sukadeva Gosvami
in $rimad-Bhagavatam (2.4.18):
kirata-hanandhra-pulinda-pulkasa
abhira-sumbha yavanah khasadayah
ye ‘nye ca papa yad-apasrayasrayah
Sudhyanti tasmai prabhavisnave namah

A Vaisnava is immediately purified, provided he follows the rules and regulations
of his bona fide spiritual master. It is not necessary that the rules and regulations
followed in India be exactly the same as those in Europe, America and other
Western countries. Simply imitating without effect is called niyamagraha. Not
following the regulative principles but instead living extravagantly is also called
niyamagraha. The word niyama means “regulative principles,” and agraha means


--- Page 67 ---
Text 107] Life’s Ultimate Goal 65
“eagerness.” The word agraha means “not to accept.” We should not follow
regulative principles without an effect, nor should we fail to accept the regulative
principles. What is required is a special technique according to country, time and
candidate. Without the sanction of the spiritual master, we should not try to imi-
tate. This principle is recommended here: Suska-vairagya-jiana saba nisedhila.
This is Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu's liberal demonstration of the bhakti cult. We
should not introduce anything whimsically, without the sanction of the bona fide
spiritual master. In this connection, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura com-
ments on these points by quoting two verses by Sri Rapa Gosvami (Bhakti-
rasamrta-sindhu 1.2.255-256).
anasaktasya visayan
yatharham upayuijatah
nirbandhah krspa-sambandhe
yuktam vairagyam ucyate
prapancikataya buddhya
hari-sambandhi-vastunah
mumuksubhih parityago
vairagyam phalgu kathyate
“When one is not attached to anything but at the same time accepts everything
in relation to Krsna, one is rightly situated above possessiveness. On the other
hand, one who rejects everything without knowledge of its relationship to Krsna
is not as complete in his renunciation.” To preach the bhakti cult, one should
seriously consider these verses.

TRANSLATION

^“ ‘One who is not envious but who is a kind friend to all living entities, who
does not think himself a proprietor, who is free from false ego, equal in both
happiness and distress, always satisfied, forgiving and self-controlled, who is
engaged in devotional service with determination and whose mind and intelli-
gence are dedicated to Me—he is very dear to Me.

PURPORT

One should not be jealous of members of other castes or nations. It is not that
only Indians or brahmanas can become Vaisnavas. Anyone can become a
Vaisnava. Therefore one should recognize that the bhakti cult must be spread all
over the world. That is real advesta. Moreover, the word maitrah, friendly, indi-
cates that one who is able to preach the bhakti cult all over the world should be
equally friendly to everyone. These two and the following six verses were spoken
by Sri Krsna in Bhagavad-gita (12.13-20).

people and should not depend upon them. One should depend solely on the
Supreme Personality of Godhead and be free from material desires. One should
also be clean, within and without. To be outwardly clean, one should regularly

in thoughts of Krsna. The words sarvarambha-parityagi indicate that one should
not be interested in the so-called smarta-vidhi of pious and impious activities.

TRANSLATION
^“ ‘Are there no torn clothes lying on the common road? Do the trees, which
exist for maintaining others, no longer give alms in charity? Do the rivers,
being dried up, no longer supply water to the thirsty? Are the caves of the
mountains now closed, or, above all, does the unconquerable Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead not protect the fully surrendered souls? Why then should
learned persons like devotees go to flatter those who are intoxicated by hard-
earned wealth?’ ’’
PURPORT
This is a quotation from Srimad-Bhagavatam (2.2.5). In this verse, Sukadeva
Cosvami advises Maharaja Pariksit that a devotee should be independent in all
circumstances. The body can be maintained with no problem if one follows the
instructions given in this verse. To maintain the body, we require shelter, food,
water and clothing, and all these necessities can be obtained without ap-
proaching puffed-up rich men. One can collect old garments that have been
thrown out, one can eat fruits offered by the trees, one can drink water from the
rivers, and one can live within the caves of mountains. By nature's arrangements,

shelter, clothing and food are supplied to the devotee who is completely surren-
dered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such a devotee does not need a
puffed-up materialistic person to maintain him. In other words, devotional service
can be discharged in any condition. This is the version of Srimad-Bhagavatam
(1.2.6).
sa vai purnsarn paro dharmo
yato bhaktir adhoksaje
ahaituky apratihata
yayatma suprasidati
“The supreme occupation [dharma] for all humanity is that by which men can at-
tain to loving devotional service unto the transcendent Lord. Such devotional ser-
vice must be unmotivated and uninterrupted in order to completely satisfy the
self.” This verse explains that devotional service cannot be checked by any ma-
terial condition.

gavam eva tu goloko

When the King of heaven, Indra, surrendered to Krsna after Krsna raised
Govardhana Hill, Lord Indra stated that above the planetary systems wherein
human beings reside is the sky, where birds fly. Above the sky is the sun and its
orbit. This is the entrance to the heavenly planets. Above the heavenly planets are
other planets, up to Brahmaloka, where those advancing in spiritual knowledge
reside. The planets up to Brahmaloka are part of the material world (Devi-dhama).
Because the material world is under the control of Devi, Durga, it is called Devi-
dhama. Above Devi-dhama is a place where Lord Siva and his wife Uma reside.
Those brightened by spiritual knowledge and liberated from material contamina-
tion reside in that Sivaloka. Beyond that planetary system is the spiritual world,
where there are planets called Vaikuntha-lokas. Goloka Vrndavana is situated
above all the Vaikuntha-lokas. Goloka Vrndavana is the kingdom of Srimati
Radharant and the parents of Krsna, Maharaja Nanda and mother Yasoda. In this
way there are various planetary systems, and they are all creations of the Supreme
Lord. As stated in Brahma-samhita:
goloka-namni nija-dhamni tale ca tasya
devi-mahesa-hari-dhamasu tesu tesu
te te prabhava-nicaya vihitas ca yena
govindam adi-purusarn tam aharih bhajami
Thus Coloka Vrndavana-dhama is situated above the Vaikuntha planets. The
spiritual sky containing all the Vaikuntha planets is very small compared to Coloka
Vrndavana-dhama. The space occupied by Coloka Vindavana-dhama is called
mahakasa, or “the greatest sky of all.” Lord Indra said, “We asked Lord Brahma
about Your eternal planet, but we could not understand it. Those fruitive actors
who have controlled their senses and mind with pious activities can be elevated
to the heavenly planets. Pure devotees who are always engaged in Lord
Narayana's service are promoted to the Vaikunthalokas. However, my Lord Krsna,
Your Goloka Vrndavana-dhama is very difficult to attain. Yet both You and that
supreme planetary system have descended here upon this earth. Unfortunately, 1
have disturbed You by my misdeeds, and that was due to my foolishness. | am
therefore trying to satisfy You by my prayers.”
ऽ Nilakantha confirms the existence of Goloka Vrndavana-dhama by quoting
the Rg-samhita (Rg Veda 1.21.154.6):

much praised).”

Illusory stories opposed to the conclusions of Krsna consciousness concern
the destruction of the Yadu dynasty, Krsna’'s disappearance, the story that
Krsna and Balarama arise from a black hair and a white hair of Ksirodakasayi
Visnu, and the story about the kidnapping of the queens. Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu explained to Sanatana Gosvami the proper conclusions of these
stories.


--- Page 77 ---
Text 118] Life’s Ultimate Goal 75
PURPORT

Due to envy, many asuras describe Krsna to be like a black crow or an incarna-
tion of a hair. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu told Sanatana Gosvami how to counteract
all these asuric explanations of Krsna. The word kaka means crow, and kesa means
hair. The asuras describe Krsna as an incarnation of a crow, an incarnation of a
৩0013 (a blackish tribe) and an incarnation of a hair, not knowing that the word
kesa means ka-isaand that ka means Lord Brahma and isa means Lord. Thus Krsna
is the Lord of Lord Brahma.

Some of Lord Krsna's pastimes are mentioned in the Mahabharata as mausala-
lila. These include the stories of the destruction of the Yadu dynasty, Krsna’s dis-
appearance, His being pierced by a hunter's arrow, the story of Krsna’s being an
incarnation of a piece of hair (kesa-avatara) as well as mabhisi-harana, the kid-
napping of Krsna's queens. Actually these are not factual but are related for the
bewilderment of the asuras who want to prove that Krsna is an ordinary human
being. They are false in the sense that these pastimes are not eternal, nor are they
transcendental or spiritual. There are many people who are by nature averse to
the supremacy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu. Such people are
called asuras. They have mistaken ideas about Krsna. As stated in Bhagavad-gita,
the asuras are given a chance to forget Krsna more and more, birth after birth.
Thus they make their appearance in a family of asuras and continue this process,
being kept in bewilderment about Krsna. Asuras in the dress of sannyasis even ex-
plain Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam in different ways according to their
own imaginations. Thus they continue to remain asuras birth after birth.

, 45 far as the kesa-avatara (incarnation of hair) is concerned, it is mentioned in
Srimad-Bhagavatam (2.7.26). The Visnu Purana also states: ujjaharatmanah kesau
sita-krspau maha-bala.

Similarly, in the Mahabharata:

sa capi kesau harir uccakarta
ekarh suklam aparam capi krspam
tau capi kesavav isatarh yadanarm
kule striyau rohinirh devakirh ca
tayor eko balabhadro babhtiva
yo sau $vetas tasya devasya kesah
krsno dvitiyah kesavah sarmbabhiva
kesah yo ‘sau varpatah 10503 uktah
Thus in Srimad-Bhagavatam, Visnu Purana and Mahabharata there are references
to Krsna and Balarama being incarnations of a black hair and a white hair. It is


--- Page 78 ---
76 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 23
stated that Lord Visnu snatched two hairs—one white and one black —from His
head. These two hairs entered the wombs of Rohini and Devaki, members of the
Yadu dynasty. Balarama was born from Rohini, and Krsna was born of Devaki. Thus
Balarama appeared from the first hair, and Krsna appeared from the second hair. It
was also foretold that all the asuras, who are enemies of the demigods, would be
cut down by Lord Visnu by His white and black plenary expansions and that the
Supreme Personality of Godhead would appear and perform wonderful activities.
In this connection, one should see Laghu-bhagavatamrta, the chapter called
Krspamrta, verses 156-164. Srila Rapa Gosvami has refuted this argument about
the hair incarnation, and his refutation is supported by Sri Baladeva
Vidyabhasana’s commentaries. This matter is further discussed in the Krsna-san-
darbha (29) and in the commentary known as Sarva-sarivadini, by Srila Jiva
Gosvami.

CHAPTER 24
The Sixty-One Explanations
of the Atmarama Verse
The following summary of this chapter is given by Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura in
1115 Amrta-pravaha-bhasya. According to Sri Sanatana Gosvami's request, Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu explained the well-known Srimad-Bhagavatam verse
beginning atmaramas ca munayo. He explained this verse in sixty-one different
ways. He analyzed all the words and described each word with its different con-
notations. Adding the words caand api, He described all the different meanings of
the verse. He then concluded that all classes of transcendentalists (18/25, karmis,
yogis) utilize this verse according to their own interpretation, but if they gave up
this process and surrendered to Krsna, as indicated by the verse itself, they would
be able to comprehend the real meaning of the verse. In this regard, ऽत Caitanya
Mahaprabhu narrated a story about how the great sage Narada converted a
hunter into a great Vaisnava, and how this was appreciated by Narada's friend
Parvata Muni. Sanatana Gosvami then offered a prayer to Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu, and Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu explained the glory of Srimad-
Bhagavatam. After this, the Lord gave Sanatana Gosvami a synopsis of Hari-bhakti-
vilasa, which Sanatana Cosvami later developed into the guiding principle of all
Vaisnavas.

PURPORT
This is a quotation from the Visva-prakasa dictionary. The Supreme Personality
of Godhead is all-pervasive. Not only does He carry the three worlds by His incon-
ceivable energy, but He maintains them also. He is also maintaining His spiritual
planet, Coloka Vrndavana, by His conjugal love, and He is maintaining the
Vaikunthalokas by His opulences. He maintains these material universes through
the external energy. Material universes are perfectly situated because they are
created by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

SYNONYMS
kurvanti—they do (for others); pada—the word; ei—this; parasmaipada—a
verb form indicating things done for others; haya—is; krsna-sukha-nimitta—to
satisfy Krsna; bhajane—in devotional service; tatparya—the purport; kahaya—is

TRANSLATION
‘The word kurvanti, which means ‘they do something for others,’ is a form
of the verb ‘things done for others.’ It is used in connection with devotional
service, which must be executed for the satisfaction of Krsna. That is the pur-
port of the word kurvanti.
PURPORT
In Sanskrit the verb “to do" has two forms, technically called parasmaipada and
atmanepada. When things are done for one’s personal satisfaction, the form is


--- Page 96 ---
94 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 24
called atmanepada. In that case, the word “do” in English is kurvante in Sanskrit.
When things are done for others, the verb form changes to kurvanti. Thus Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu informed Sanatana Cosvami that in the atmarama verse the
verb kurvanti means that things should be done only for the satisfaction of Krsna.
This is supported by the grammarian Panini. The verb is formed as atmanepada
when the work is to be done for one’s own benefit, and when it is done for
others, it is called parasmaipada. Thus the verb is formed according to whether
something is done for one’s self-satisfaction or for another's satisfaction.

TRANSLATION
“When the devotee somehow or other always remembers the Supreme Per-

four miserable conditions.
PURPORT
The four miserable conditions are due to the four kinds of sinful activities,
known as (1) pataka, (2) urupataka, (3) maha-pataka and (4) atipataka—
preliminary sin, very great sin, greater sin and topmost sin. However, Krsna assures
the devotee, aha tvam sarva-papebhyo moksayisyami ma sucah: “I will protect
you from all sinful reactions. Do not fear.” The word sarva-papebhyah indicates
four kinds of sinful activity. As soon as the devotee surrenders unto Krsna’s lotus
feet, he is certainly relieved from all sinful activities and their results. The four
basic sinful activities are summarized as illicit sex, intoxication, gambling and
meat-eating.

PURPORT
This is a quotation from Bhagavad-gita (7.16). The word sukrtinah is very impor-
tant in this verse. Su means “auspicious,” and krti means “meritorious” or
“regulated.” Unless one follows the regulative principles of religious life, human
life is no different from animal life. Religious life means following the principles of
varpa and asrama. In the Vispu Purana it is said:
varnasramacaravata
pususena parah puman
visnur aradhyate pantha
nanyat tat-tosa-karanam
According to religious life, society is divided into four social divisions —brahmana,
ksatriya, vaisya and sadra—and four spiritual divisions—brahmacarya, grhastha,
vanaprastha and sannyasa. One needs to be trained to become a brahmana,
ksatriya, vaiSya or stdra, just as one is trained to become an engineer, doctor or
lawyer. Those who are properly trained can be considered human beings; if one is

130 Sri Caitanya-caritamria [Madhya-lila, Ch. 24
not trained socially and spiritually —that is, if one is uneducated and unregu-
lated—his life is on the animal platform. Among animals there is no question of
spiritual advancement. Spiritual life can be attained by proper training —either by
following the principles of varna and asrama or by being directly trained in the
bhakti school by the methods of $/3৮303/0 kirtanarm visnoh smaranarm pada-
sevanam/arcanarn vandanari dasyarn sakhyam atma-nivedanam. Without being
trained, one cannot be sukrti, auspicious. In this verse Krsna says that people ap-
proach Him when in distress, in need of money or when actually inquisitive to un-
derstand the Supreme Being or the original source of everything. Some people ap-
proach Him in the pursuit of knowledge of the Absolute Truth, and others ap-
proach Him when they are distressed, like the devotee Gajendra. Others are in-
quisitive, like the great sages headed by Sanaka, and others need money, like
Dhruva Maharaja. Sukadeva Gosvami approached the Lord when he pursued
knowledge. All these great personalities thus took to the devotional service of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna.

TRANSLATION

‘The intelligent, who have understood the Supreme Lord in the associ-

ation, can never avoid hearing the glories of the Lord, even though they have
heard them only once.’

PURPORT

This is a verse from Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.10.11). All the members of the Kuru
dynasty offered respects when Krsna was leaving Hastinapura after the Battle of
Kuruksetra. Krsna was going to His own kingdom, and all the members of the Kuru
dynasty were overwhelmed by His departure. This verse was spoken in that con-
nection by Sukadeva Gosvami. A pure devotee becomes attached to Krsna by
hearing the Lord's glories. The Lord's glories and the Lord Himself are identical.
One has to be qualified to understand this Absolute Truth; therefore one should
be given a chance to associate with a pure devotee. Our Krsna consciousness
movement is meant for this purpose. We want to create pure devotees so that
other people will benefit by their association. In this way the number of pure
devotees increases. Professional preachers cannot create pure devotees. There
are many professional preachers of Srimad-Bhagavatam who read this work to
earn their livelihood. However, they cannot convert materialistic people to devo-
tional service. Only a pure devotee can convert others to pure devotional service.
It is therefore important for all the preachers in our Krsna consciousness move-
ment to first become pure devotees and follow the regulative principles,
refraining from illicit sex, meat-eating, gambling and intoxication. They should
regularly chant the Hare Krsna maha-mantra on their beads, follow the devotional
process, rise early in the morning, attend margala-arati and recite Srimad-
Bhagavatam and Bhagavad-gita regularly. In this way, one can become purified
and free from all material contamination.

once capture the Supreme Lord in their hearts. Therefore there is no need for

Text 105] Explanations of the Atmarama Verse 137
Srimad-Bhagavatam it is said: srama eva hi kevalam. In the eyes of a devotee, poli-
ticians, social workers, philanthropists, philosophers and humanitarians are simply
wasting their time, for human society is not freed from the cycle of birth and
death by their activity and propaganda. These so-called philanthropists, politi-
cians and philosophers have no knowledge because they do not know that there
is life after death. Understanding that there is life after death is the beginning of
spiritual knowledge. A person can understand himself and what he is simply by
understanding the first lessons of Bhagavad-gita.
dehino ’smin yatha dehe
kaumaram yauvanam jara
tatha dehantara-praptir
dhiras tatra na muhyati
“As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to
old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. The self-realized soul
is not bewildered by such a change.” (Bg. 2.13)

Not knowing the real science of life one engages in the temporary activities of
this life and thus becomes further entangled in the cycle of birth and death. Thus
one always desires material opulence, which can be attained by karma, jana and
yoga. However, when one is actually elevated to the devotional platform, he
gives up all these desires. This is called anyabhilasita-stanya. Then one becomes a
pure devotee.

PURPORT
Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura has given the following summary of verses 107-111.
Transcendentalists on the path of philosophical speculation can be divided into
two categories —the pure worshiper of impersonal Brahman and he who wishes
to merge into the existence of impersonal Brahman. When one is fully absorbed in
the thought that one is not different from the Supreme Absolute Truth, one is said
to be a worshiper of the impersonal Brahman. The impersonal worshipers of Brah-
man can again be divided into three categories— (1) sadhaka, those who are
nearing perfect execution of the process of Brahman realization; (2) those who
are fully absorbed in meditation on Brahman; and (3) those who are on the
brahma-bhata platform and have no relationship with material existence. Even
though the worshiper of impersonal Brahman can be highly advanced, he cannot
attain liberation without discharging devotional service. Anyone who has realized
himself as spirit soul can engage in devotional service. This is the verdict of
Bhagavad-gita:


--- Page 143 ---
Text 112] Explanations of the Atmarama Verse 141
brahma-bhatah prasannatma
na socati na kank sati
samah sarvesu bhatesu
mad-bhaktiri labhate param
“One who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman
and is fully joyful. He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally dis-
posed to every living entity. In that state he attains pure devotional service unto
Me.” Bg. 18.54)

To attain the platform of pure devotional service, one has to become spiritually
pure and attain the brahma-bhata platform, which is beyond material anxiety and
material discrimination. When one approaches pure devotional service after
realizing Brahman, one becomes attracted by pure devotional service. At such a
time, by rendering devotional service, one gets a spiritual body with purified
senses.

This is a quotation from the Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.26). Those who actually

dess Kali and Kala-bhairava (Rudra). The devotees of Krsna, however, do not envy
the demigods or their worshipers but peacefully render devotional service to the
incarnations of Narayana instead.

Text 125] Explanations of the Atmarama Verse 149
PURPORT
The four Kumaras (Catuhsana), Sukadeva Gosvami and the nine Yogendras
were absorbed in Brahman realization, and how they became devotees is de-
scribed herein. There are three kinds of impersonalists—the mumuksu (those
desiring liberation), the jivan-muktas (those liberated in this life) and the prapta-
svartipas (those merged in Brahman realization). All three types of janis are called
moksakarksis, those desiring liberation. By associating with devotees, such peo-
ple give up the mumuksu principle and render devotional service. The real cause
for this change is the association of devotees. This Krsna consciousness move-
ment is meant to attract all types of men, even those who desire things other than
the Lord's devotional service. Through the association of devotees, they gradually
begin to render devotional service.

becomes Krsna’s competitor. This is called viparyayah asmrtih. To nullify this
mistake, one who is actually learned and advanced worships the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead as his spiritual master, worshipful Deity and source of
life. He thus worships the Lord by the process of unalloyed devotional
service.’

^“ ‘Those who follow the path of great, saintly mystic yogis take to the yogic
gymnastic process and begin worshiping from the abdomen, where it is said
that Brahman is located. Such people are called $arkaraksa, which means that
they are situated in the gross bodily conception. There are also followers of
the rsi known as Aruna. Following that path, they observe the activities of the
arteries. Thus they gradually rise to the heart, where subtle Brahman, Param-
atma, is situated. They then worship Him. O unlimited Ananta! Better than
these persons are the mystic yogis who worship You from the top of their
heads. Beginning with the abdomen and proceeding through the heart, they
reach the top of the head and pass through the brahma-randhra, the hole at
the top of the skull. Thus yogis attain the perfectional platform and do not
enter the cycle of birth and death again.’

Whatever material happiness is available within the fourteen worlds is at-
tained by the force of time, just as one attains distress in due course of time.
Since these are not attained by spiritual consciousness, one should not try for
them.’
PURPORT
This verse was spoken by Narada Muni in Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.5.18). Narada
Muni was speaking to Vyasadeva, who was morose even after he had compiled
all Vedic literatures. In this connection, Narada Muni advised Srila Vyasadeva to
attain devotional service.

TRANSLATION
‘ ‘Devotional perfection is very difficult to attain for two reasons. First,
unless one is attached to Krsna, he cannot attain devotional perfection even if
he renders devotional service for a long time. Second, Krsna does not easily
deliver perfection in devotional service.’
PURPORT
As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (5.6.18): muktirh dadati karhicit. $rila Sukadeva
Gosvami told Maharaja Pariksit that Krsna readily grants liberation but does not
very readily grant perfection in devotional service. This means that Krsna wants to
see that a devotee is actually sincere and serious and that he does not have
ulterior motives. If this is the case, devotional service can very easily be suc-
cessful; otherwise it is very difficult to obtain from the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. This verse appears in the Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu (1.1.35).

difficulty for those who are advanced in Vedic knowledge?’
PURPORT
This is a quotation from Srimad-Bhagavatam (2.7.46). Lord Brahma said this
when speaking to his disciple Narada about the wonderful characteristics of Lord
Visnu. Simply by chanting the glories of Lord Visnu, one can cross the ocean of
nescience, even though one may be lowborn.

samuccaye —in the sense of aggregation; atmaramah eva—all the atmaramas (all

‘In that case, by the word ca, the word eva is meant. The word api can be

that is, ‘even all kinds of living beings worship Krsna.’
PURPORT
It is here mentioned that every living entity is atmarama. Temporarily covered
by the influence of maya, the living entity serves his senses, which are repre-
sented as kama-krodha-lobha-moha-mada-matsarya. In the material condition, all
living entities are engaged in sense gratification, but when they associate with
devotees who follow the regulative principles, they become purified and
awakened to their original consciousness. They then attempt to satisfy the senses
of Lord Krsna and engage in His devotional service.

--- Page 197 ---
Text 206] Explanations of the Atmarama Verse 195
PURPORT
This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita wherein the Lord says:
marn hi partha vyapasritya
ye ‘pi syuh papa-yonayah
striyo vaisyas tatha sadras
te ‘pi yanti param gatim
“O son of Prtha, those who take shelter in Me, though they be of lower birth—
women, vaisyas [merchants], as well as sadras [workersl—can approach the
supreme destination.” (9.32)

Everyone is eligible to become Krsna's devotee. One simply has to be trained
according to the approved process. It is the work of Krsna’s confidential devotees
to turn everyone into a Krsna bhakta. If the confidential devotees do not take up
the task of elevating everyone to Krsna consciousness, then who will do it? Those
who claim to be devotees but do not engage in Krsna's service to elevate all living
creatures to Krsna consciousness are to be considered kanistha-adhikaris (people
in the lowest stage of devotional service). When one rises to the second platform
of devotional service, his business is to propagate Krsna consciousness all over the
world. Those who are active in the Krsna consciousness movement should not
remain in the neophyte stage but should rise to the platform of preachers, the
second platform of devotional service. Devotional service is so enchanting that
even the first-class devotees (uttama-adhikaris) also come down to the second
platform to preach and render service to the Lord for the benefit of the whole
world.

gymnastic process and begin worshiping from the abdomen, where it is said
that Brahman is located. Such people are called 5३११९, which means that they
are situated in the gross bodily conception. There are also followers of the rsi
known as Aruna. Following that path, they observe the activities of the ar-
teries. Thus they gradually rise to the heart, where subtle Brahman, Param-
atma, is situated. They then worship Him. O, unlimited Ananta! Better than
these persons are the mystic yogis who worship You from the top of their
heads. Beginning with the abdomen and proceeding through the heart, they
reach the top of the head and pass through the brahma-randra, the hole at the
top of the skull. Thus yogis attain the perfectional platform and do not enter
the cycle of birth and death again.’

“Those who are in the bodily conception mainly engage in fruitive activity.
Those who perform yajias and ritualistic ceremonies are also considered in
the same category. However, when they are all in contact with the pure devo-

you are distributing.’
PURPORT
This verse from Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.18.12) was spoken to Sata Gosvami at
the meeting of great sages at Naimisaranya. The great sages were headed by
Saunaka, and Sata Gosvami spoke of the glorious activities of the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead at that meeting. At that time, all the rsis assembled there
neglected to complete the ritualistic ceremonies because there was no positive
assurance of the results. All the performers were coated with black ash due to the
large amount of smoke coming from the fire.

PURPORT
The anvacaye meaning of the word ca indicates that between the two words
compounded by the word ca, one is given more importance, and the other is con-
sidered subordinate. For example: “O brahmacari, please go out and collect alms
and at the same time bring in the cows.” In this statement, the collection of alms
is of first importance, and the second business of collecting the cows is subordi-
nate. Similarly, one who always meditates upon Krsna is mainly a devotee of Krsna
engaged in His devotional service. Other dtmaramas are subordinate in devotional
service.

Text 232] Explanations of the Atmarama Verse 211
PURPORT
The great saint Narada is so liberated that he can go to the Vaikuntha planets to
see Narayana and then immediately come to this planet in the material world and
go to Prayaga to bathe in the confluence of three rivers. The word tri-veni refers
to a confluence of three rivers. This confluence is still visited by many hundreds of
thousands of people who go there to bathe, especially during the month of Janu-
ary (Magha-mela). A liberated person who has no material body can go anywhere
and everywhere; therefore a living entity is called sarva-ga, which indicates that
he can go anywhere and everywhere. Presently scientists are trying to go to other
planets, but due to their material bodies, they are not free to move at will.
However, when one is situated in his original spiritual body, he can move any-
where and everywhere without difficulty. Within this material world there is a
planet called Siddhaloka, whose inhabitants can go from one planet to another
without the aid of a machine or space rocket. In the material world every planet
has a specific advantage (vibhati-bhinna). In the spiritual world, however, all the
planets and their inhabitants are composed of spiritual energy. Because there are
no material impediments, it is said that everything in the spiritual world is one.

Text 250] Explanations of the Atmarama Verse 219
SYNONYMS

narada kahe—Narada Muni replied; ardha marile —by half-killing the animals;
jiva paya vyatha —the living beings suffer too much pain; jive duhkha ditecha—
you are giving troubles to the living beings; tomara—your; ha-ibe —there will be;
aiche avastha—the same suffering in retaliation.

TRANSLATION

‘Narada Muni replied, ‘If you leave the animals half-dead, you are pur-

posefully giving them pain. Therefore you will have to suffer in retaliation.’
PURPORT

This is an authoritative statement given by the greatest authority, Narada Muni.
If one gives another living entity unnecessary pain, one will certainly be punished
by the laws of nature by a similar pain. Although the hunter Mrgari was un-
civilized, he still had to suffer the results of his sinful activities. However, if a
civilized man kills animals regularly in a slaughterhouse to maintain his so-called
civilization, using scientific methods and machines to kill animals, one cannot
even estimate the suffering awaiting him. So-called civilized people consider
themselves very advanced in education, but they do not know about the
stringent laws of nature. According to nature's law, it is a life for a life. We can
hardly imagine the sufferings of one who maintains a slaughterhouse. He endures
suffering not only in this life, but in his next life also. It is said that a hunter, mur-
derer orkilleris advised not to live and not to die. If he lives, he accumulates even
more sins, which bring about more suffering in a future life. He is advised not to
die because his dying means that he immediately begins to endure more suffering.
Therefore he is advised not to live and not to die.

As followers of the Vedic principles, we accept the statements of Narada Muni
in this regard. It is our duty to see that no one suffers due to sinful activities.
Foolish rascals are described in Bhagavad-gita as mayayapahrta-jianah, which indi-
cates that although they are superficially educated, maya has taken their real
knowledge away. Such people are presently leading human society. In Srimad-
Bhagavatam they are also described as andha yathandhair upaniyamanah. These
rascals are themselves blind, and yet they are leading others who are blind. When
people follow such leaders, they suffer unlimited pains in the future. Despite so-
called advancement, all this is happening. Who is safe? Who is happy? Who is
without anxiety?

SYNONYMS

vyadha tumi—you are a hunter; jiva mara—your occupation is to kill animals;
alpa—slight; aparadha—offense; tomara—your; kadarthana diya—unnecessarily
giving them pain; mara’—when you kill; € papa apara—this sinful activity is
unlimited.

TRANSLATION

‘Narada Muni continued, ‘My dear hunter, your business is killing animals.
That is a slight offense on your part, but when you consciously give them un-
necessary pain by leaving them half-dead, you incur very great sins.’

PURPORT

This is another good instruction to animal killers. There are always animal killers
and animal eaters in human society because less civilized people are accustomed
to eating meat. In Vedic civilization, meat-eaters are advised to kill an animal for
the goddess Kali or a similar demigod. This is in order not to give the animal un-
necessary pain, as slaughterhouses do. In the balidana sacrifice to a demigod, it is
recommended to cut the throat of an animal with one slice. This should be done
on a dark-moon night, and the painful noises expressed by the animal at the time
of being slaughtered are not to be heard by anyone. There are also many other
restrictions. Slaughter is only allowed once a month, and the killer of the animal
has to suffer similar pains in his next life. At the present moment, so-called
civilized men do not sacrifice animals to a deity in a religious or ritualistic way.

They openly kill animals daily by the thousands for no purpose other than the

satisfaction of the tongue. Because of this the entire world is suffering in so many

ways. Politicians are unnecessarily declaring war, and, according to the stringent
laws of material nature, massacres are taking place between nations.
prakrteh kriyamanani

“The bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of material

nature, thinks himself to be the doer of activities, which are in actuality carried out

by nature.” (Bg. 3.27) The laws of prakrti (nature) are very stringent. No one
should think that he has the freedom to kill animals and not suffer the conse-
quences. One cannot be safe by doing this. Narada Muni herein says that animal


--- Page 223 ---
Text 251] Explanations of the Atmarama Verse 221
killing is offensive, especially when animals are given unnecessary pain. Meat-
eaters and animal killers are advised not to purchase meat from the
slaughterhouse. They can worship Kali once a month, kill some unimportant
animal and eat it. Even by following this method, one is still an offender.

SYNONYMS

kadarthiya—giving unnecessary pangs; tumi—you; yata—all; marila—killed;
jivere—the living entities; tara—all of them; taiche—similarly; toma—you;
maribe—will kill; janma-janma-antare —life after life.

TRANSLATION

‘‘Narada Muni continued, ‘All the animals that you have killed and given un-
necessary pain will kill you one after the other in your next life and in life after
life.”

PURPORT

This is another authoritative statement made by the great sage Narada. Those
who kill animals and give them unnecessary pain—as people do in
slaughterhouses —will be killed in a similar way in the next life and in many lives to
come. One can never be excused from such an offense. If one kills many thou-
sands of animals in a professional way so that other people can purchase the meat
to eat, one must be ready to be killed in a similar way in his next life and in life
after life. There are many rascals who violate their own religious principles. Ac-
cording to Judeo-Christian scriptures, it is clearly said, “Thou shalt not kill.” None-
theless, giving all kinds of excuses, even the heads of religions indulge in killing
animals while trying to pass as saintly persons. This mockery and hypocrisy in
human society bring about unlimited calamities; therefore occasionally there are
great wars. Masses of such people go out onto battlefields and kill themselves.
Presently they have discovered the atomic bomb, which is simply awaiting
wholesale destruction. If people want to be saved from the killing business life
after life, they must take to Krsna consciousness and cease sinful activity. The In-
ternational Society for Krishna Consciousness recommends that everyone aban-
don meat-eating, illicit sex, intoxication and gambling. When one gives up these


--- Page 224 ---
222 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 24
sinful activities, he can understand Krsna and take to this Krsna consciousness
movement. We therefore request everyone to abandon sinful activity and chant
the Hare Krsna mantra. In this way people can save themselves from repeated
birth and death.

SYNONYMS
narada-sange —in the association of the great sage Narada Muni; vyadhera—of
the hunter; mana—the mind; parasanna ha-ila—became cleansed and satisfied;
tanra—his; vakya—words; suni’—hearing; mane —in the mind; bhaya upajila—
some fear arose.
TRANSLATION
‘‘In this way, through the association of the great sage Narada Muni, the
hunter was a little convinced of his sinful activity. He therefore became some-
what afraid due to his offenses.
PURPORT
This is the effect of associating with a pure devotee. Our preachers who are
preaching Krsna consciousness all over the world should follow in the footsteps of
Narada Muni and become purified by following the four principles and chanting
the Hare Krsna maha-mantra. This will make them fit to become Vaisnavas. Then,
when they speak to sinful people about the teachings of this Krsna consciousness
movement, people will be affected and take the instructions. We receive instruc-
tions in devotional service through the disciplic succession. Narada Muni is our
original guru because he is the spiritual master of Vyasadeva. Vyasadeva is the
spiritual master of our disciplic succession; therefore we should follow in the
footsteps of Narada Muni and become pure Vaisnavas. A pure Vaisnava is one
who has no ulterior motive. He has totally dedicated himself to the service of the
Lord. He does not have material desires, and he is not interested in so-called
learning and philanthropic work. The so-called learned scholars and
philanthropists are actually karmis and jAanis, and some are actually misers
engaged in sinful activity. All are condemned because they are not devotees of
Lord Krsna.


--- Page 225 ---
Text 253] Explanations of the Atmarama Verse 223
This is a chance to become purified by associating with this Krsna conscious-
ness movement and strictly following the rules and regulations. By chanting the
Hare Krsna maha-mantra, one can become free from all contamination, especially
contamination brought about by the killing of animals. Lord Krsna Himself re-
quested:
sarva-dharman parityajya
mam ekarn saraparh vraja
aha (३/7) sarva-papebhyo
moksayisyami ma sucah
“Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. | shall deliver you
from all sinful reaction. Do not fear.” (Bg. 18.66)

We should take this instruction from Krsna and follow in the footsteps of
Narada Muni in the disciplic succession. If we simply surrender unto Krsna's lotus
feet and take this Krsna consciousness movement seriously, we can be freed from
the karma incurred by sin. If we are intelligent enough, we shall engage in the
loving service of the Lord. Then our lives will be successful, and we shall not have
to suffer like the hunter life after life. By killing animals, not only will we be bereft
of the human form but we will have to take an animal form and somehow or
other be killed by the same type of animal we have killed. This is the law of
nature. The Sanskrit word mamsa means “meat.” It is said: mar sah khadati iti
mamsah. That is, “I am now eating the flesh of an animal who will some day in the
future be eating my flesh.”

TEXT 253

SYNONYMS

vyadha kahe—the hunter said; balya haite—from the very beginning of my
childhood; ei amara karma—I have been taught this business (half-killing animals);
kemane—how; tarimu—shall become free from these sinful activities; muii—I;
pamara adhama—sinful and misled.

TRANSLATION

“The hunter then admitted that he was convinced of his sinful activity, and

he said, “1 have been taught this business from my very childhood. Now | am


--- Page 226 ---
224 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 24
wondering how | can become freed from these unlimited volumes of sinful ac-
tivity.”
PURPORT
This kind of admission is very beneficial as long as one does not again commit
sin. Cheating and hypocrisy are not tolerated by higher authorities. If one under-
stands what sin is, he should give it up with sincerity and regret and surrender
unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead through His agent, the
pure devotee. In this way, one can be freed from the reactions of sin and make
progress in devotional service. However, if one continues committing sins after
making some atonement, he will not be saved. In the sastras, such atonement is
compared to an elephant’s bathing. An elephant takes a very good bath and
cleanses its body very nicely, but as soon as it comes out of the water, it picks up
some dust on the shore and throws it all over its body. Atonement may be carried
out very nicely, but it will not help a person if he continues committing sins.
Therefore the hunter first admitted his sinful activity before the saintly person
Narada and then asked how he could be saved.

ei—this; papa yaya mora—sinful reaction of my life can be washed off; kemana
updye—by what means; nistara karaha more—kindly deliver me; padon—I fall
down; tomara paye—at your lotus feet.
TRANSLATION
“The hunter continued, ‘My dear sir, please tell me how | can be relieved
from the reactions of my sinful life. Now | fully surrender unto you and fall
down at your lotus feet. Please deliver me from sinful reactions.’
PURPORT
By the grace of Narada Muni, the hunter came to his good senses and im-
mediately surrendered unto the saint's lotus feet. This is the process. By associ-
ating with a saintly person, one is able to understand the reactions of his sinful life.


--- Page 227 ---
Text 255] Explanations of the Atmarama Verse 225
When one voluntarily surrenders to a saintly person who is a representative of
Krsna and follows his instructions, one can become freed from sinful reaction.
Krsna demands the surrender of a sinful man, and Krsna's representative gives the
same instructions. The representative of Krsna never tells his disciple, “Surrender
unto me.” Rather he says, “Surrender unto Krsna.” If the disciple accepts this prin-
ciple and surrenders himself through the representative of Krsna, his life is saved.

TRANSLATION

“Narada Muni assured the hunter, ‘If you listen to my instructions, |! shall

find the way you can be liberated.’
PURPORT

Gaurangera bhakta-gane jane jane sakti dhare. The purport of this song is that
the devotees of Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu are very powerful, and each and
every one of them can deliver the whole world. What, then, to speak of Narada
Muni? If one follows the instructions of Narada Muni, one can be delivered from
any amount of sinful reactions. This is the process. One must follow the instruc-
tions of a spiritual master; then one will certainly be delivered from all sinful reac-
tion. This is the secret of success. Yasya deve para bhaktir yatha deve tatha gurau.
If one has unflinching faith in Krsna and the spiritual master, the result is tasyaite
kathita hy arthah prakasante mahatmanah: all the conclusions of revealed scrip-
tures will be open to such a person. A pure devotee of Krsna can make the same
demands that Narada Muni is making. He says, “If you follow my instructions, |
shall take responsibility for your liberation.” A pure devotee like Narada can give
assurance to any sinful man because by the grace of the Lord such a devotee is
empowered to deliver any sinful person if that person follows the principles set
forth.

Text 258] Explanations of the Atmarama Verse 227
PURPORT
The source of our income is not actually the source of our maintenance. Every
living being —from the great Brahma down to an insignificant ant—is being main-
tained by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Eko bahtinari yo vidadhati kaman.
The one Supreme Being, Krsna, maintains everyone. Our so-called source of in-
come is our own choice only. If I wish to be a hunter, it will appear that hunting is
the source of my income. If | become a brahmana and completely depend on
Krsna, | do not conduct a business, but nonetheless my maintenance is supplied
by Krsna. The hunter was disturbed about breaking his bow because he was wor-
ried about his income. Narada Muni assured the hunter because he knew that the
hunter was not being maintained by the bow but by Krsna. Being the agent of
Krsna, Narada Muni knew very well that the hunter would not suffer by breaking
the bow. There was no doubt that Krsna would supply him food.

dhanuka bhangi’—breaking the bow; vyadha—the hunter; tarnra—his (Narada

TRANSLATION
‘‘Being thus assured by the great sage Narada Muni, the hunter broke his
bow, immediately fell down at the saint's lotus feet and fully surrendered.
After this, Narada Muni raised him with his hand and gave him instructions for
spiritual advancement.
PURPORT
This is the process of initiation. The disciple must surrender to the spiritual
master, the representative of Krsna. The spiritual master, being in the disciplic suc-
cession stemming from Narada Muni, is in the same category with Narada Muni. A
person can be relieved from his sinful activity if he surrenders to the lotus feet of a
person who actually represents Narada Muni. Narada Muni gave instructions to
the hunter after the hunter surrendered.

ghare giya—returning home; brahmane—to the brahmanas, the most intelli-
gent men in spiritual understanding; deha’—give; yata—whatever; ache—you

“Narada Muni then advised the hunter, ‘Return home and distribute
whatever riches you have to the pure brihmanas who know the Absolute
Truth. After distributing all your riches to the brahmanas, both you and your
wife should leave home, taking only one cloth to wear.’
PURPORT
This is the process of renunciation at the stage of vanaprastha. After enjoying
householder life for some time, the husband and wife must leave home and dis-
tribute their riches to brahmanas and Vaisnavas. One can keep his wife as an assis-
tant in the vanaprastha stage. The idea is that the wife will assist the husband in
spiritual advancement. Therefore Narada Muni advised the hunter to adopt the
vanaprastha stage and leave home. It is not that a grhastha should live at home un-
til he dies. Vanaprastha is preliminary to sannyasa. In the Krsna consciousness
movement there are many young couples engaged in the Lord's service. Even-
tually they are supposed to take vanaprastha, and after the vanaprastha stage the
husband may take sannyasa in order to preach. The wife may then remain alone
and serve the Deity or engage in other activities within the Krsna consciousness
movement.

TRANSLATION
^“ ‘After planting the tulasi tree before your house, you should daily cir-
cumambulate that tulasi plant, serve her by giving her water and other things,
and continuously chant the Hare Krsna maha-mantra.’
PURPORT
This is the beginning of spiritual life. After leaving householder life, one may go
to a holy place, such as the bank of the Ganges or Yamuna, and erect a small cot-
tage. A small cottage can be constructed without any expenditure. Four logs
serving as pillars can be secured by any man from the forest. The roof can be
covered with leaves, and one can cleanse the inside. Thus one can live very
peacefully. In any condition, any man can live in a small cottage, plant a tulasi
tree, water it in the morning, offer it prayers, and continuously chant the Hare
Krsna maha-mantra. Thus one can make vigorous spiritual advancement. This is
not at all difficult. One simply has to follow the instructions of the spiritual master
strictly. Then everything will be successful in due course of time. As far as eating is
concerned, there is no problem. If Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead,


--- Page 232 ---
230 Sri Caitanya-caritaimrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 24
supplies everyone with eatables, why should He not supply His devotee? Some-
times a devotee will not even bother to construct a cottage. He will simply go to
live in a mountain cave. One may live in a cave, in a cottage beside a river, in a
palace or in a big city like New York or London. In any case, a devotee can follow
the instructions of his spiritual master and engage in devotional service by
watering the tulasi plant and chanting the Hare Krsna mantra. Taking the advice of
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and our spiritual master, Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati
Gosvami Maharaja, one can go to any part of the world and instruct people to
become devotees of the Lord by following the regulative principles, worshiping
the tulasi plant and continuously chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra.

material necessities. Krsna says that He personally carries all the necessities to His
devotees.

that one should not want more than what is absolutely necessary. Narada Muni
advises the hunter to accept only what is absolutely necessary for him and his
wife. The devotee should always be alert to consume only those things that he
absolutely requires and not create unnecessary needs.

Text 268] Explanations of the Atmarama Verse 233
PURPORT
It is the duty of the public to present a gift to a saintly person, Vaisnava or
brahmana when going to see him. Every Vaisnava is dependent on Krsna, and
Krsna is ready to supply all of life's necessities, provided a Vaisnava follows the
principles set forth by the spiritual master. There are certainly many householders
in our Krsna consciousness movement. They join the movement and live in the
society's centers, but if they take advantage of this opportunity and do not work
but live at the expense of the movement, eating prasada and simply sleeping, they
place themselves in a very dangerous position. It is therefore advised that
grhasthas should not live in the temple. They must live outside the temple and
maintain themselves. Of course, if the grhasthas are fully engaged in the Lord's
service according to the directions of the authorities, there is no harm in their
living in a temple. In any case, a temple should not be a place to eat and sleep. A
temple manager should be very careful about these things.

TRANSLATION
‘Narada Muni said, ‘My dear hunter, such behavior is not at all astonishing.
A man in devotional service is automatically nonviolent. He is the best of
gentlemen.
PURPORT
In this verse the word sadhu-varya means “the best of gentlemen.” At the
present moment there are many so-called gentlemen who are expert in killing
animals and birds. Nonetheless, these so-called gentlemen profess a type of
religion that strictly prohibits killing. According to Narada Muni and Vedic culture,
animal killers are not even gentlemen, to say nothing of being religious men. A
religious person, a devotee of the Lord, must be nonviolent. Such is the nature of a
religious person. It is contradictory to be violent and at the same time call oneself
a religious person. Such hypocrisy is not approved by Narada Muni and the dis-
ciplic succession.

“When Parvata Muni saw the ecstatic loving symptoms of the hunter, he
told Narada, ‘Certainly you are a touchstone.’


--- Page 241 ---
Text 278] Explanations of the Atmarama Verse 239
PURPORT

When a touchstone touches iron, it turns the iron to gold. Parvata Muni called
Narada Muni a touchstone because by his touch the hunter, who was lowest
among men, became an elevated and perfect Vaisnava. Srila Bhaktivinoda
Thakura said that the position of a Vaisnava can be tested by seeing how good a
touchstone he is—that is, by seeing how many Vaisnavas he has made during his
life. A Vaisnava should be a touchstone so that he can convert others to Vaisnav-
ism by his preaching, even though people may be fallen like the hunter. There are
many so-called advanced devotees who sit in a secluded place for their personal
benefit. They do not go out to preach and convert others into Vaisnavas, and
therefore they certainly cannot be called sparsa-mani, advanced devotees.
Kanistha-adhikari devotees cannot turn others into Vaisnavas, but a madhyama-
adhikari Vaisnava can do so by preaching. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu advised His
followers to increase the numbers of Vaisnavas.

yare dekha, tare kaha ‘krspa’-upadesa
amara ajidya guru hana tara’ ei desa
(Cc. Madhya 7.128)
1015 $rf Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s wish that everyone should become a Vaisnava and
guru. Following the instructions of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and His disciplic suc-
cession, one can become a spiritual master, for the process is very easy. One can
go everywhere and anywhere to preach the instructions of Krsna. Bhagavad-gita is
Krsna's instructions; therefore the duty of every Vaisnava is to travel and preach
Bhagavad-git3, either in his country or a foreign country. This is the test of sparsa-
mani, following in the footsteps of Narada Muni.

‘‘Parvata Muni continued, ‘My dear friend Narada Muni, you are glorified as
the sage among the demigods. By your mercy, even a lowborn person like this
hunter can immediately become attached to Lord Krsna.’
PURPORT
A pure Vaisnava believes in the statements of the sastras. This verse is quoted
from Vedic literature, the Skanda Purana.
TEXT 279

SYNONYMS
narada kahe—Narada Muni said; vaispava—O Vaisnava; tomdara—your;
anna—food; kichu aya—does any come; vyadha kahe—the hunter replied; yare
pathao—whoever you send; sei—that person; diya—giving something; yaya—
goes.
TRANSLATION
‘Narada Muni then asked the hunter, ‘My dear Vaisnava, do you have some
income for your maintenance?’ The hunter replied, ‘My dear spiritual master,
whoever you send gives me something when he comes to see me.’
PURPORT
This confirms the statement in Bhagavad-gita (9.22) to the effect that the Lord
carries all necessities to His Vaisnava devotee. Narada Muni asked the former
hunter how he was being maintained, and he replied that everyone who came to
see him brought him something for his maintenance. Krsna, who is situated in
everyone's heart, says, “I personally carry all necessities to a Vaisnava.” He can
order anyone to execute this. Everyone is ready to give something to a Vaisnava,
and if a Vaisnava is completely engaged in devotional service, he need not be
anxious for his maintenance.

eta anna—so much food; na pathdo—you do not need to send; kichu karya
nai—there is no such need; sabe —only; dui-janara—for two persons; yogya—
requisite; bhaksya-matra—eatables; cai—we want.
TRANSLATION
“The former hunter said, ‘Please do not send so many grains. Only send
what is sufficient for two people, no more.’
PURPORT
The former hunter only wanted enough for two people to eat, no more. It is not
necessary for a Vaisnava to keep a stock of food for the next day. He should
receive only sufficient grains to last one day. The next day, he must again depend
on the Lord's mercy. This is the instruction of जा Caitanya Mahaprabhu. When His
personal servant Govinda sometimes kept a stock of haritaki (myrobalan), Sr
Caitanya Mahaprabhu chastised him, saying, “Why did you keep a stock for the
next day?” Srila Ripa Gosvami and others were begging daily from door to door
for their sustenance, and they never attempted to stock their asrama with food for
the next day. We should not materially calculate, thinking, “It is better to stock
food for a week. Why give the Lord trouble by having Him bring food daily?” One
should be convinced that the Lord will provide daily. There is no need to stock
food for the next day.

number of devotees under the headings of regular devotees and spontaneous
devotees 15 thirty-two.

These expansions are thus compared to candles that have been lit from an original
candle. All the secondary candles are equally powerful, but the original candle is
that from which all the others have been lit. Krsna is the original Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead, and He is expanded as Balarama, Sankarsana, Aniruddha,
Pradyumna and Vasudeva. In this way there are innumerable incarnations and ex-
pansions who are also called Bhagavan, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

SYNONYMS

jata-ajata-rati-bhede —by distinction of mature love and immature love;
sadhaka dui bheda—those practicing are of two varieties; vidhi—regulative
devotion; raga—spontaneous devotion; marge—on both the paths; cari cari—
there are four different varieties; asta bheda—a total of eight kinds.

TRANSLATION

“Those who are practicing devotional service are either mature or im-
mature. Therefore the sadhakas are of two types. Since the devotees execute
either regulative devotional service or spontaneous devotional service and
there are four groups within these two divisions, altogether there are eight
varieties.

PURPORT

Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura says that the original Personality of
Godhead, Krsna, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and His expansions are
also called the Personality of Godhead. However, Krsna is the original Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Speculative philosophers and mystic yogis also meditate
upon the form of Krsna, but this form is not the form of the original Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead. Such a Bhagavan is but a partial representation of the Lord's
full potency. Nonetheless, He has to be understood to be the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. To clarify this matter, one should simply understand that Krsna, the
son of Nanda Maharaja in Vrndavana, the friend of the cowherd boys and lover of
the gopis, is actually the original Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is attained
by spontaneous love. Although His expansions are also called the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead, They are attained only by the execution of regulative devo-
tional service.

Krsna's service. That is the sixty-first meaning of the verse.

be learned only through devotional service, not by material intelligence,
speculative methods or imaginary commentaries.’ ^“

PURPORT

Devotional service includes nine processes, beginning with hearing, chanting
and remembering the activities of Lord Visnu. Only one who has taken to devo-
tional service can understand Srimad-Bhagavatam, which is the spotless Purana for
a transcendentalist (paramaharisa). So-called commentaries are useless for this
purpose. According to the Vedic injunction: yasya deve para bhaktir yatha deve
tatha gurau. All Vedic literatures maintain that Srimad-Bhagavatam has to be
learned from the person bhagavata, and to understand it one has to engage in
pure devotional service. Srimad-Bhagavatam cannot be understood by so-called
erudite scholars or grammarians. One who has developed pure Krsna conscious-
ness and has served the pure devotee, the spiritual master, can understand
Srimad-Bhagavatam. Others cannot.

TRANSLATION
“If one becomes a madman like Me, he may also understand the meaning of
Srimad-Bhagavatam by this process.”
PURPORT
5 Caitanya Mahaprabhu plainly explains that Srimad-Bhagavatam cannot be
understood by those who are materially situated. In other words, one has to
become a madman like ৩1 Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Apart from being the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is an 3০373 who exhibited love
of God like a madman. According to His own written verse: yugdyitarn nimesena.
He says that for Him, “a moment seems to last twelve years.” Caksusa
pravrsayitam: “My tears are flowing like torrents of rain.” Sanyayitar jagat sar-
vam: “I feel as if the entire universe were vacant.” Why? Govinda-virahena me:
“Due to My being separated from Govinda, Krsna.”
_ One can understand Srimad-Bhagavatam only by following in the footsteps of
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who was mad for Krsna. We cannot, of course, imitate
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. It is not possible. However, unless one is very serious
about understanding Krsna, he cannot understand Srimad-Bhagavatam. Srimad-
Bhagavatam gives the full narration of Krsna's transcendental activities. The first
nine cantos explain who Krsna is, and the Lord's birth and activities are narrated in
the Tenth Canto. In Bhagavad-gitait is stated: janma karma ca me divyam. Krsna's
appearance and disappearance are transcendental, not mundane. A person is
eligible to return home, back to Godhead, if he perfectly understands Krsna and
His appearance and disappearance. This is verified by Bhagavad-gita: tyaktva
deham punar janma naiti mam eti so ‘rjuna.
It is therefore concluded that one has to learn about Krsna from Srimad-
Bhagavatam and Bhagavad-gita, and one has to follow in the footsteps of Sri


--- Page 266 ---
264 $ri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 24
Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Those who do not follow Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu cannot
understand Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam.

PURPORT
Actually Sanatana Gosvami belonged to a very respectable brahmana family.
Nonetheless, he submitted himself as a fallen, lowborn person because he had


--- Page 267 ---
Text 326] Explanations of the Atmarama Verse 265
served in the Mohammedan government. A brahmana is never supposed to be
engaged for anyone's service. Accepting service for a livelihood (paricaryatmakam
karma) is the business of ८८/25. The brahmana is always independent and busy
studying sastra and preaching sastra to subordinate social members such as
ksatriyas and vaisyas. Sanatana Gosvami felt unfit to write Vaisnava smrti about
the behavior of Vaisnavas because he had fallen from the brahminical position.
Thus Sanatana Gosvami clearly admits that the brahminical culture should be
standardized. Presently in India, so-called brahmanas are almost all engaged in
some mundane service, and they do not understand the import of the Vedic
sastras. Nonetheless, they are passing themselves off as brahmanas on the basis of
birth. In this connection, 59173809173 Gosvami declares that a brahmana cannot be
engaged in anyone's service if he wants to take a leading part in society. In
Srimad-Bhagavatam Narada Muni states that even if a brahmana is in a difficult
position, he should not accept the occupation of a Sidra. This means that he
should not be engaged in service for another, for this is the business of dogs.
Under the circumstances, Sanatana Gosvami felt very low because he had ac-
cepted the service of the Muslim government. The conclusion is that no one
should claim to be a brahmana simply by birthright while engaging in someone
else’s service.

literatures are not mental concoctions. They are all authorized literature meant to
guide those who are going to be Vaisnavas. Under these circumstances, an

ordinary man cannot give his own opinion. His opinion must always correspond
with the conclusion of the Vedas. Unless one is fully qualified in Vaisnava
behavior and authorized by superior authority (the Supreme Personality of
Godhead), one cannot write Vaisnava literatures or purports and commentaries
on Srimad-Bhagavatam and Bhagavad-gita.

assured of the spiritual master’s position. Similarly, the spiritual master can
also be assured of the disciple’s position. The Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Krsna, should be described as the worshipable object, and you
should consider the bija-mantra for the worship of Krsna, Rama or any other
expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

PURPORT

In the Padma Purana, the characteristics of the guru, the bona fide spiritual

master, have been described:
maha-bhagavata-srestho
brahmano vai gurur nrpam
sarvesam eva lokanam
asau puajyo yatha harih
maha-kula-prasato ‘pi
sarva-yajiesu diksitah
sahasra-sakhadhyayi ca
na guruh syad avaisnavah
The guru must be situated on the topmost platform of devotional service. There
are three classes of devotees, and the guru must be accepted from the topmost
class. The first-class devotee is the spiritual master for all kinds of people. It is said:
gurur nrnam. The word nrnam means “of all human beings.” The guru is not
limited to a particular group. It is stated in the Upadesamrta of Rapa Gosvami that
a guru is a gosvami, a controller of the senses and the mind. Such a guru can ac-
cept disciples from all over the world. Prthivirn sa Sisyat. This is the test of the
guru.

In India there are many so-called gurus, and they are limited to a certain district
or a province. They do not even travel about India, yet they declare themselves to
be jagad-guru, gurus of the whole world. Such cheating gurus should not be ac-
cepted. Anyone can see how the bona fide spiritual master accepts disciples from
all over the world. The guru is a qualified brahmana; therefore he knows Brahman
and Parabrahman. He thus devotes his life for the service of Parabrahman. The
bona fide spiritual master who accepts disciples from all over the world is also
worshiped all over the world because of his qualities. Lokanam asau pajyo yatha
harih: the people of the world worship him just as they worship the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead. All these honors are offered to him because he strictly
follows the brahminical principles and teaches these principles to his disciples.
Such a person is called an acarya because he knows the principles of devotional
service, he behaves in that way himself, and he teaches his disciples to follow in
his footsteps. Thus he is an acarya or jagad-guru. Even though a person is born in a


--- Page 271 ---
Text 330] Explanations of the Atmarama Verse 269
brahminical family and is very expert in performing sacrifices, he cannot be ac-
cepted as a guru if he is not a strict Vaisnava. A guru is a brahmana by qualifica-
tion, and he can turn others into brahmanas according to the $astric principles and
brahminical qualifications. Brahmanism is not a question of heredity. In Srimad-
Bhagavatam (7.32.11) Sri Narada Muni tells Maharaja Yudhisthira what a brahmana
is. He states that if brahminical qualifications are observed in ksatriyas, vaisyas or
even sadras, one should accept them as brahmanas. In this regard, Srila Sridhara
Svami has commented: samadibhir eva brahmanadi-vyavaharo mukhyah, na jati-
matradity aha—yasyeti. yad yadi anyatra varpantare ‘pi drsyeta, tad-varnantaram
tenaiva laksana-nimittenaiva varnena vinirdiset, na tu jati-nimittenety arthah.

There is a similar statement made by Nilakantha, the commentator on
Mahabharata:

$adro 421 samady-upeto brahmana eva
brahmano ‘pi kamady-upetah sadra eva
“Although one may be born in a sadra family, if he is endowed with the brahmini-
cal qualities beginning with sama [control of the mind], he is to be accepted as a
brahmana. Although one may be born in a brahmana family, if he is endowed with
the qualities beginning with kama [lust], he is to be considered a sadra.” No one
should present himself as a brahmana simply on the basis of being born in a
brahminical family. One must be qualified by the brahminical qualities mentioned
in the 52511725, particularly Bhagavad-gita:
samo damas tapah saucarn
ksantir arjavam eva ca
jAdnam vijidnam astikyarn
brahma-karma svabhava-jam
“Peacefulness, self-control, austerity, purity, tolerance, honesty, wisdom,
knowledge and religiousness —these are the qualities by which the brahmanas
work.” (Bg. 18.42)

Unless one is qualified with all these attributes, he cannot be accepted as a
brahmana. It is not a question of simply taking birth in a brahmana family. In this
regard, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura remarks that Narottama dasa
Thakura and Syamananda Gosvami, although not born in brahmana families, are
accepted as bona fide spiritual masters because they were brahmanas by
qualification. Personalities like 67 Ganga-narayana, Ramakrsna and many others,
who were actually born in brahmana families, accepted Narottama dasa Thakura
and Syamananda Gosvami as their spiritual masters.

The maha-bhagavata is one who decorates his body with tilaka and whose
name indicates him to be a servant of Krsna by the word dasa. He is also initiated


--- Page 272 ---
270 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 24
by a bona fide spiritual master and is expert in worshiping the Deity, chanting
mantras correctly, performing sacrifices, offering prayers to the Lord, and per-
forming sarikirtana. He knows how to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead
and how to respect a Vaisnava. When one has attained the topmost position of
maha-bhagavata, he is to be accepted as a guru and worshiped exactly like Hari,
the Personality of Godhead. Only such a person is eligible to occupy the post of a
guru. However, if one is highly qualified but is not a Vaisnava, he cannot be ac-
cepted as a guru. One cannot be a brahmana unless one is a Vaisnava. If one is a
Vaisnava, he is already a brahmana. If a guru is completely qualified as a Vaisnava,
he must be accepted as a brahmana even if he is not born in a brahmana family.
The caste system method of distinguishing a brahmana by birth is not acceptable
when applied to a bona fide spiritual master. A spiritual master is a qualified
brahmana and acarya. If one is not a qualified brahmana, he is not expert in
studying Vedic literatures. Nana-sastra-vicaranaika-nipunau. Every Vaisnava is a
spiritual master, and a spiritual master is automatically expert in brahminical
behavior. He also understands the Vedic sastras.

Similarly, a disciple’s qualifications must be observed by the spiritual master
before he is accepted as a disciple. In our Krsna consciousness movement, the re-
quirement is that one must be prepared to give up the four pillars of sinful life—il-
licit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling. In Western countries especially,
we first observe whether a potential disciple is prepared to follow the regulative
principles. Then he is given the name of a Vaisnava servant and initiated to chant
the Hare Krsna maha-mantra, at least sixteen rounds daily. In this way the disciple
renders devotional service under the guidance of the spiritual master or his repre-
sentative for at least six months to a year. He is then recommended for a second
initiation, during which a sacred thread is offered and the disciple is accepted as a
bona fide brahmana. Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura introduced the
system of giving the sacred thread to a bona fide Vaisnava, and we are also
following in his footsteps. The qualifications of a bona fide disciple are described
in Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.10.6) as follows:

amanya-matsaro dakso
nirmamo drdha-sauhrdah
asatvaro ‘rtha-jijAiasur
anasayur amogha-vak
The disciple must have the following qualifications. He must give up interest in
the material bodily conception. He must give up material lust, anger, greed, illu-
sion, madness and envy. He should be interested only in understanding the
science of Cod, and he should be ready to consider all points in this matter. He
should no longer think, “I am this body,” or, “This thing belongs to me.” One must
love the spiritual master with unflinching faith, and one must be very steady and


--- Page 273 ---
Text 330] Explanations of the Atmarama Verse 271
fixed. The bona fide disciple should be inquisitive to understand transcendental
subject matter. He must not search out faults among good qualities, and he
should no longer be interested in material topics. His only interest should be
Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

As far as the mutual testing of the spiritual master and disciple is concerned,
Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura explains that a bona fide disciple must be
very inquisitive to understand the transcendental subject matter. As stated in
Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.3.21):

tasmad gururn prapadyeta
11755८40 sreya uttamam
“One who is inquisitive to understand the highest goal and benefit of life must
approach a bona fide spiritual master and surrender unto him.” A serious disciple
must be alert when selecting a bona fide spiritual master. He must be sure that the
spiritual master can deliver all the transcendental necessities. The spiritual master
must observe how inquisitive the disciple is and how eager he is to understand
the transcendental subject matter. The spiritual master should study the disciples
inquisitiveness for no less than six months or a year. A spiritual master should not
be very anxious to accept a disciple because of his material opulences. Sometimes
a big businessman or landlord may approach a spiritual master for initiation. Those
who are materially interested are called visayis (karmis), which indicates that they
are very fond of sense gratification. Such visayis sometimes approach a famous
guru and ask to become a disciple just as a matter of fashion. Sometimes visayis
pose as disciples of a reputed spiritual master just to cover their activities and ad-
vertise themselves as advanced in spiritual knowledge. In other words, they want
to attain material success. A spiritual master must be very careful in this regard.
Such business is going on all over the world. The spiritual master does not accept
a materially opulent disciple just to advertise the fact that he has such a big disci-
ple. He knows that by associating with such visayi disciples, he may fall down.
One who accepts a visayi disciple is not a bona fide spiritual master. Even if he is,
his position may be damaged due to association with an unscrupulous visayi. If a
so-called spiritual master accepts a disciple for his personal benefit or for material
gain, the relationship between the spiritual master and the disciple turns into a
material affair, and the spiritual master becomes like a smarta-guru. There are
many caste gosvamis who professionally create some disciples who do not care
for them or their instructions. Such spiritual masters are satisfied simply to get
some material benefits from their disciples. Such a relationship is condemned by
Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura, who calls such spiritual masters and disci-
ples a society of cheaters and cheated. They are also called baulas or prakrta-saha-
jiyas. Their aim is to make the connection between the spiritual master and the
disciple into a very cheap thing. They are not serious in wanting to understand
spiritual life.

272 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta {Madhya-lila, Ch. 24
The words sevya bhagavan in this verse are important. Bhagavan indicates the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Visnu. Lord Visnu alone is worshipable.
There is no need to worship demigods. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita:
kamais tais tair hrta-jnanah
prapadyante ‘nya-devatah
tarn tarh niyamam asthaya
prakrtya niyatah svaya
“Those whose minds are distorted by material desires surrender unto demigods
and follow the particular rules and regulations of worship according to their own
natures.” (Bg. 7.20)
It is also stated in the Skanda Purana:
vasudevarn parityajya
yo ‘anya-devam upasate
svamatararn parityajya
$va-pacirh vandate hi sah
“A person who worships the demigods and gives up Lord Vasudeva is like a man
who gives up the protection of his mother for the shelter of a witch.”
It is also stated in Bhagavad-gita (9.23):
ye ‘py anya-devata-bhakta
yajante sraddhayanvitah
te ‘pi mam eva kaunteya
yajanty avidhi-parvakam
“Whatever a man may sacrifice to other gods, O son of Kuntj, is really meant for
Me alone, but it is offered without true understanding.”

Demigods are also living entities and parts and parcels of Krsna. Therefore in
one sense one worships Krsna when one worships the demigods, but not in the
proper way. There is a proper method to water a tree. One should water the
roots, but if one waters the leaves and branches instead, he is simply wasting his
time. If one worships the demigods to the exclusion of Lord Visnu, his rewards will
only be material. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita:

antavat tu phalarh tesarn
tad bhavaty alpa-medhasam
devan deva-yajo yanti
mad-bhakta yanti mam api

Text 330] Explanations of the Atmarama Verse 273
“Men of small intelligence worship the demigods, and their fruits are limited and
temporary. Those who worship the demigods go to the planets of the demigods,
but My devotees ultimately reach My supreme planet.” (Bg. 7.23)

Demigod worship is meant for unintelligent men because the benefits derived
from demigod worship are all material, temporary and retractable. It is also stated
in the Hari-bhakti-vilasa:

yas tu nardayanar devam
brahma-rudradi-devataih
samatvenaiva vikseta
sa pasandi bhaved dhruvam
“Whoever thinks Lord Visnu and the demigods are on the same level is to be im-
mediately considered a rogue as far as spiritual understanding is concerned.”

There are three modes of nature in the material world, but when one is situated
spiritually, he is above the material modes, even though he lives in this material
world. Lord Krsna states in Bhagavad-gita (14.26):

mar ca yo 'vyabhicarena

bhakti-yogena sevate
sa gunan samatityaitan
brahma bhayaya kalpate

“One who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any cir-
cumstances at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to
the level of Brahman.” When one engages in the Supreme Lord's devotional ser-
vice, he is in a transcendental position. Even though one may be situated in the
mode of goodness in the material world, he is susceptible to pollution by the
modes of passion and ignorance. When the mode of goodness is mixed with the
mode of passion, one worships the sun-god, Vivasvan. When the mode of good-
ness is mixed with the mode of ignorance, he worships Ganapati, or Ganesa.
When the mode of passion is mixed with the mode of ignorance, one worships
Durga, or Kali, the external potency. When one is simply in the mode of ig-
norance, he becomes a devotee of Lord Siva because Lord Siva is the pre-
dominating deity of the mode of ignorance within this material world. However,
when one is completely free from the influence of all the modes of material
nature, he becomes a pure Vaisnava on the devotional platform. Srila Rapa
Gosvami states in Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu:

anyabhilasita-sanyam

jAana-karmady-anavrtam

The position of visuddha-sattva is the position of uncontaminated goodness. On
that platform, one can then understand, aradhyo bhagavan vrajesa-tanayas tad-
dhama vrndavanam: “The Supreme Personality of Godhead, the son of Nanda
Maharaja, is to be worshiped along with His transcendental abode, Vrndavana.”
The word sarva-mantra-vicarana means “considering all different types of
mantras.” There are different kinds of mantras for different kinds of devotees.
There are the mantras known as the dvadasaksara, and these are composed of
twelve syllables. Similarly, there are mantras composed of eighteen syllables —the
Narasimha mantra, the Rama mantra, Gopala mantra and so on. Each and every
mantra has its own spiritual significance. The spiritual master has to select a
mantra for his disciple according to the disciple’s ability to chant different mantras.

‘You should discuss the qualifications necessary for receiving a mantra, the

PURPORT
The following injunction is given in the Hari-bhakti-vilasa (1.194):

--- Page 277 ---
Text 331] Explanations of the Atmarama Verse 275
sadhvinam adhikaro ‘sti
sadradinar ca sad-dhiyam
“Sadras and women who are chaste and sincerely interested in understanding the
Absolute Truth are qualified to be initiated with the pancaratrika-mantras.” This is
also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (9.32):
mam hi partha vyapasritya
ye ‘pi syuh papa-yonayah
striyo vaisyds tatha sadras
te ‘pi yanti param gatirm
“O son of Prtha, those who take shelter in Me, though they be of lower birth —
women, vaisyas [merchants], as well as sadras [workers] —can approach the
supreme destination.”

If one actually wants to serve Krsna, it doesn’t matter whether one is a ৪0013,
vaisya, or even a woman. If one is sincerely eager to chant the Hare Krsna mantra
or diksa-mantra, he is qualified to be initiated according to the pancaratrika pro-
cess. According to Vedic principles, only a brahmana who is fully engaged in his
occupational duties can be initiated. $adras and women are not admitted to a
vaidika initiation. Unless one is fit according to the estimation of the spiritual
master, one cannot accept a mantra from the pancaratrika-vidhi or the vaidika-
vidhi. When one is fit to accept the mantra, he is initiated by the pancaratrika-
vidhi or the vaidika-vidhi. In any case, the result is the same.

Regarding mantra-siddhi-adi-sodhana, the efficiency of the mantra, Srila Bhakti-
siddhanta Sarasvati Thakura gives sixteen divisions, which are confirmed in the
Hari-bhakti-vilasa (beginning with 1.204):

siddha-sadhya-susiddhari-

kramaj /7€}/0 vicaksanaih
These are (1) siddha, (2) sadhya, (3) susiddha and (4) ari. These four principles
can be divided further: (1) siddha-siddha, (2) siddha-sadhya, (3) siddha-susid-
dha, (4) siddha-ari, (5) sadhya-siddha, (6) sadhya-sadhya, (7) sadhya-susiddha,
(8) sadhya-ari, (9) susiddha-siddha, (10) susiddha-sadhya, (11) susiddha-susid-
dha, (12) susiddha-ari, (13) ari-siddha, (14) ari-sadhya, (15) ari-susiddha, and
(16) ari-ari.

Those who are initiated with the eighteen-alphabet mantra do not need to
consider the above-mentioned sixteen divisions. As enjoined in the Hari-bhakti-
vilasa (1.215, 219, 220):

na catra satrava dosa
narpasvadi-vicarana


--- Page 278 ---
276 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 24

There is sodhana, or purification of the mantra, but there is no such consideration
for the Krsna mantra. Balitvat krspa-mantranarm sarhskarapeksanar na hi. “The
Krsna mantra is so strong that there is no question of sodhana. (1.235)

As far as diksa is concerned, one should consult Madhya-lila, Chapter Fifteen
(108). On the whole, when a person is initiated according to the pancaratrika-
vidhi, he has already attained the position of a brahmana. This is enjoined in the
Hari-bhakti-vilasa (2.12):

yatha kancanatam yati
karnhsyar rasa-vidhanatah
tatha diksa-vidhanena
dvijatvam jayate nrpnam
“As bell metal can be turned into gold when treated with mercury, a disciple initi-
ated by a bona fide guru immediately attains the position of a brahmana.”

As far as the time of diksa (initiation) is concerned, everything depends on the
position of the guru. As soon as a bona fide guru is received by chance or by a
program, one should immediately take the opportunity to receive initiation. In the
book called Tattva-sagara, it is stated:

durlabhe sad-guranar ca
sakrt-sanga upasthite
tad-anujia yada labdha
sa diksavasaro mahan
grame va yadi varanye

Text 322] Explanations of the Atmarama Verse 277
na tirtharh na vratarh hemo

“If, by chance, one gets a sad-guru, it doesn’t matter whether one is in the
temple or the forest. If the sad-guru, the bona fide spiritual master, agrees, one
can be initiated immediately, without waiting for a suitable time or place.”

In the early morning hours (known as brahma-muharta) one should get up and
immediately chant the Hare Krsna mantra, or, at least, “Krsna, Krsna, Krsna.” In this
way, one should remember Krsna. Some slokas or prayers should also be chanted.
By chanting, one immediately becomes auspicious and transcendental to the in-
fection of material qualities. Actually one has to chant and remember Lord Krsna
twenty-four hours daily, or as much as possible.

smartavyah satatarn visnur
vismartavyo na jatucit
sarve vidhi-nisedhah syur
etayor eva kinkarah
“Krsna is the origin of Lord Visnu. He should always be remembered and never
forgotten at any time. All the rules and prohibitions mentioned in the sastras
should be the servants of these two principles.” This is a quotation from Padma
Purana in the portion called Brhat-sahasra-nama-stotra.

Pratah-krtya means that one should evacuate regularly and then cleanse himself
by taking a bath. One has to gargle (dcamana) and brush his teeth (danta-
dhavana). He should do this either with twigs or a toothbrush—whatever
is available. This will purify the mouth. Then one should take his bath. Actually
householders and vanaprasthas should bathe two times a day (pratar-
madhyahnayoh snanarn vanaprastha-grhasthayoh). A sannyasi should bathe three
times daily, and a brahmacari may take only one bath a day. Whenever one is not
able to bathe in water, he can bathe by chanting the Hare Krsna mantra. One also
has to perform his sandhyadi-vandana—that is, one has to chant his Gayatri
mantra three times daily —morning, noon and evening.

panca—five; sodasa—sixteen; paicasat—fifty; upacare—with ingredients; ar-
cana—offering worship; parnca-kala—five times; paja—worshiping; arati—
offering arati; krsnera bhojana-sayana—in this way offering eatables to Krsna and

TRANSLATION

“Also describe Deity worship, wherein one should offer food to Krsna at
least five times daily. One should in due time place Krsna on a bed. You
should also describe the process for offering arati and the worship of the Lord
according to the list of five, sixteen or fifty ingredients.

PURPORT

The five ingredients are (1) very good scents, (2) very good flowers,
(3) incense, (4) a lamp and (5) something edible. As for sodasopacara, the six-
teen ingredients, one should (1) provide a sitting place (dsana), (2) ask Krsna to
sit down, (3) offer arghya, (4) offer water to wash the legs, (5) wash the mouth,
(6) offer madhu-parka, (7) offer water for washing the mouth, (8) bathe,
(9) offer garments, (10) decorate the Lord’s body with ornaments, (11) offer
sweet scents, (12) offer flowers with good fragrance, like the rose or campaka,
(13) offer incense, (14) offer alamp, (15) give good food, and (16) offer prayers.

In the Hari-bhakti-vilasa (Eleventh 4152, verses 127-140) there is a vivid
description of what is required in Deity worship. There are sixty-four items men-
tioned. In the temple, worship should be so gorgeous that all sixty-four items
should be available for the satisfaction of the Personality of Godhead. Sometimes
it is impossible to get all sixty-four items; therefore we recommend that at least
on the first day of installation all sixty-four items should be available. When the
Lord is established, worship with all sixty-four items should continue as far as
possible. The sixty-four items are as follows: (1) There must be a big bell hanging
in front of the temple room so that whoever comes in the room can ring the bell.
This item is called prabodhana, or offering oneself submissively to the Lord. This is
thefirstitem. (2) The visitor must chant jaya $ri Radha-Govinda, or jaya $ri Radha-
Madhava when he rings the bell. In either case, the word jaya must be uttered.
(3) One should immediately offer obeisances to the Lord, falling down like a stick.
(4) There must be regular marigala-arati in the temple during the early morning,
an hour and a half before the sun rises. (5) There must be an dsana, a sitting place
before the altar. This asana is for the spiritual master. The disciple brings every-
thing before the spiritual master, and the spiritual master offers everything to the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. (6) After mangala-arati, the Deity is supposed


--- Page 282 ---
280 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 24
to wash His teeth by using a twig; therefore a twig must be offered. (7) Water
must be offered for washing the Deity’s feet. (8) Arghya should be offered.
(9) Water for dcamana should be offered. (10) Madhu-parka, a small bow! con-
taining madhu (honey, a little ghee, a little water, a little sugar, yogurt and milk)
should be offered. This is called madhu-parka-acamana. (11) One should place
wooden slippers before the Lord. (12) One should massage the body of the Lord.
(13) One should massage the body of the Lord with oil. (14) With a soft, wet
sponge one should remove all the oil smeared over the Lord's body. (15) One
should bathe the Lord with water in which nicely scented flowers have been
soaking for some time. (16) After bathing the body of the Lord with water, one
should bathe Him with milk. (17) Then with yogurt. (18) Then with ghee.
(19) Then with honey. (20) Then with sugar. (21) Then one should wash the
Deity with water and chant this mantra:
cintamani-prakara-sadmasu kalpa-vrksa-
laksavrtesu surabhir abhipalayantam
laksmi-sahasra-sata-sambhrama-sevyamanam
govindam adi-purusarn tam aharh bhajami

(22) One should dry the entire body with a towel. (23) A new dress should be
put on the body. (24) A sacred thread should be given to the body. (25) Water
should be offered for cleansing the mouth (dcamana). (26) Nicely scented oils like
liquid sandalwood pulp should be smeared over the body. (27) All kinds of orna-
ments and crowns should be placed on the body. (28) Then one should offer
flower garlands and decorative flowers. (29) One should burn incense.
(30) Lamps should be offered. (31) Precautions should always be taken so that
demons and atheists cannot harm the body of the Lord. (32) Food offerings
should be placed before the Lord. (33) Spices for chewing should be offered.
(34) Betel nuts should be offered. (35) At the proper time, there should be ar-
rangements so that the Lord may take rest in bed. (36) The Lord's hair should be
combed and decorated. (37) First-class garments should be offered. (38) A first-
class helmet should be offered. (39) The garments should be scented. (40) There
should be Kaustubha jewels and other ornaments offered. (41) A variety of
flowers should be offered. (42) Another marngala-arati should be offered. (43) A
mirror should be offered. (44) The Lord should be carried on a nice palanquin to
the altar. (45) The Lord should be seated on the throne. (46) Again water should
be given for the washing of His feet. (47) Something again should be offered for
eating. (48) Evening arati. (49) The Lord should be fanned with a camara fan, and
an umbrella should be placed over His head. (50) The Hare Krsna mantra and ap-
proved songs should be sung. (51) Musical instruments should be played.
(52) One should dance before the Deity. (53) One should circumambulate the
Deity. (54) One should again offer obeisances. (55) One should offer different


--- Page 283 ---
Text 335] Explanations of the Atmarama Verse 281
types of prayers and hymns at the Lord's lotus feet. (56) One should touch the
lotus feet of the Lord with one’s head. This may not be possible for everyone, but
at least the pajari should do this. (57) The flowers offered on the previous day
should touch one’s head. (58) One should take the remnants of the Lord's food.
(59) One should sit before the Lord and think that he is massaging the Lord's legs.
(60) One should decorate the Lord's bed with flowers before the Lord takes His
rest. (61) One should offer one’s hand to the Lord. (62) One should take the
Deity to His bed. (63) One should wash the feet of the Lord and then sit Him on
the bed. (64) One should place the Lord on the bed and then massage His feet.

Arati should be offered to the Deities five times daily—early in the morning
before sunrise, later in the morning, at noon, in the evening and at night. This
means that there should be worship and a change of dress and flowers. As far as
the eatables are concerned, all items should be first-class preparations. There
should be first-class rice, dahl, fruit, sweet rice, vegetables and a variety of foods
to be sucked, drunk and chewed. All the eatables offered to the Deities should be
extraordinarily excellent. In Europe and America there is presently no monetary
scarcity. People are not poor, and if they follow these principles of Deity worship,
they will advance in spiritual life. As far as placing the Deity in the bed is con-
cerned, if the Deity is large and heavy, it is not possible to move Him daily. It is
better that a small Deity, which is also worshiped, be taken to the bed. This
mantra should be chanted: agaccha sayana-sthanarh priyabhih saha kesava. “O
Kesava, kindly come to Your bed along with Srimati Radharani.”” (Hari-bhakti-vildsa
11.40)

The Deity should be placed in bed with Srimati Radharani, and this should be
indicated by bringing the wooden slippers from the altar to the bedside. When
the Deity is laid down, His legs should be massaged. Before laying the Deity
down, a pot of milk and sugar should be offered to Him. After taking this thick
milk, the Deity should lie down and should be offered betel nuts and spices to
chew.

TRANSLATION

‘You should glorify the holy name and carefully give up offenses when
chanting the holy name. One should know the symptoms of a Vaisnava. One
must give up or nullify all kinds of seva-aparadha, offenses in Deity worship.

PURPORT

The devotee should always be very careful not to commit the ten offenses
when chanting the Hare Krsna mantra. If a devotee very strictly follows the
methods of Deity worship, he will naturally and quickly become a pure Vaisnava.
A pure Vaisnava has unflinching faith in the Lord, and he does not deviate at all.
He is always engaged in perfect Deity worship.

One should also notice the specific offenses against Deity worship. These are
mentioned in the Skanda Purana (Avanti-khanda), spoken by Vyasadeva himself.
One should liquidate all kinds of offenses.

The salagrama-sila should be worshiped with tulasi where a sufficient quantity
of tulasi leaves are available. Worship of salagrama-sila should be introduced in all
ISKCON temples. Salagrama-sila is the form of the Lord's mercy. To worship the
Deity with the sixty-four items mentioned may be a difficult job, but the Lord has


--- Page 285 ---
Text 337] Explanations of the Atmarama Verse 283
become so small that anyone in any temple can carefully handle Deity worship
simply by performing the same activities with salagrama-sila.

There are thirty-two offenses that should be avoided. (1) One should not enter
the temple in a vehicle. Shoes and slippers should be removed before entering the
temple. (2) One should offer obeisances as soon as he sees the Deity. (3) One
should enter the temple after taking a bath. In other words, one should be very
clean. (4) One should not offer obeisances to the Lord with one hand. (5) One
should not circumambulate demigods before the Deities. (6) One should not
spread out his legs before the Deity. (7) One should not sit down before the
Deity with his legs crossed, nor should one touch his legs with his hands. (8) One
should not lie down before the Deity. (9) One should not eat before the Deity.
(10) One should not speak lies before the Deity. (11) One should not speak very
loudly before the Deity. (12) One should not talk nonsense before the Deity.
(13) One should not cry before the Deity. (14) One should not deal with others
before the Deity. (15) One should not utter harsh words before the Deity.
(16) One should not cover himself with a blanket. (17) One should not talk en-
viously of others before the Deity. (18) One should not praise others before the
Deity. (19) One should not use slang before the Deity. (20) One should not pass
air before the Deity. (21) One should not neglect the sixty-four items of Deity
worship. (22) One should not eat anything not offered to the Deity. (23) One
should not neglect offering seasonal fruits as soon as they are available. (24) One
should always offer fresh, untouched fruit to the Deity. (25) One should not sit
with his back toward the Deity. (26) One should not offer obeisances to others
before the Deity. (27) One should not sit near the Deity without taking the
spiritual master’s permission. (28) One should not be proud to hear himself
praised before the Deity. (29) One should not blaspheme the demigods.
(30) One should not be unkind to others before the Deities. (31) One should ob-
serve all festivals in the temple. (32) One should not fight or quarrel before the
Deity.

the pleasure of devotional service within his heart. Thus he can be compared

CHAPTER 25
How All the Residents of Varanasi
Became Vaisnavas

The following is a summary of Chapter Twenty-five. A Maharastrian brahmana
who was living in Benares was a great devotee of $i Caitanya Mahaprabhu. He
was always very happy to hear of the glories of the Lord, and it was by his ar-
rangement that all the sannyasis of Varanasi became devotees of Lord Caitanya
Mahaprabhu. He invited all the sannyasis to his house to meet ऽं Caitanya
Mahaprabhu, and this incident has been described in the Seventh Chapter of Adi-
1112. From that day, $f Caitanya Mahaprabhu became famous in the city of
Varanasi, and many important men in that city became His followers. By and by,
one of the disciples of the great sannyasi Prakasananda Sarasvati became devoted
to Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and this devotee explained $rf Caitanya Mahaprabhu
to Prakasananda Sarasvati and supported His views with various arguments.

One day Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu went to take a bath at Pafca-nada, and
afterwards all His devotees began chanting the Hare Krsna mantra in front of the
temple of Bindu Madhava. At this time Prakasananda Sarasvati and all his devo-
tees approached the Lord. Prakasananda Sarasvati immediately fell down at the
lotus feet of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and very much regretted his past behavior
toward the Lord. He asked ऽ Caitanya Mahaprabhu about devotional service in
terms of the Vedanta-satra, and the Lord told him about devotional service that is
approved by great personalities who know the Vedanta-satra. ऽ Caitanya
Mahaprabhu then pointed out that Srimad-Bhagavatam is the proper commentary
on the Vedanta-satra. He then explained the catuh-sloki (four slokas) of Srimad-
Bhagavatam, the essence of that great scripture.

From that day on, all the sannyasis of Varanasi became devotees of ri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu. Before returning to His headquarters at jagannatha Puri, the Lord ad-
vised Sanatana Gosvami to go to Vrndavana. The Lord then departed for Jagan-
natha Puri. Kaviraja Gosvami then describes something about Srila Rapa Gosvamr,
Sanatana Gosvami and Subuddhi Raya. ऽ Caitanya Mahaprabhu returned to
Jagannatha Puri through the great forest of Jharikhanda in central India. At the end
of this chapter, Kaviraja Gosvami sums up the incidents of Madhya-lila and in-
structs every living being to read this sublime book of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu's
pastimes.

300 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 25
PURPORT

If one saw the personal characteristics and activities of Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu, one would certainly be convinced that He was the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead. One can ascertain this by following in the footsteps of the
dastric injunctions. This sincere study and appreciation of গা Caitanya
Mahaprabhu is also applicable to His authorized devotees, and it is clearly stated
in the Caitanya-caritamrta (Antya-lila, 7.11):

kali-kalera dharma ——krsna-nama-sankirtana
krsna-sakti ৮173 nahe tara pravartana
In this age of Kali, real religious propaganda should induce people to chant the
Hare Krsna maha-mantra. This is possible for someone who is especially em-
powered by Krsna. No one can do this without being especially favored by Krsna.
Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura comments in this regard in his Anubhasya,
wherein he quotes a verse from Narayana-sambhita:
dvapariyair janair visnuh
pancaratrais tu kevalaih
kalau tu nama-matrena
puajyate bhagavan harih

“In Dvapara-yuga, devotees of Lord Visnu and Krsna rendered devotional service
according to the principles of pancaratrika. In this age of Kali, the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead is worshiped simply by the chanting of His holy names.” Srila
Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura then comments: “Without being empowered
by the direct potency of Lord Krsna to fulfill His desire and without being
specifically favored by the Lord, no human being can become the spiritual master
of the whole world. He certainly cannot succeed by mental concoction, which is
not meant for devotees or religious people. Only an empowered personality can
distribute the holy name of the Lord and enjoin all fallen souls to worship Krsna.
By distributing the holy name of the Lord, he cleanses the hearts of the most fallen
people; therefore he extinguishes the blazing fire of the material world. Not only
that, he broadcasts the shining brightness of Krsna's effulgence throughout the
world. Such an acarya, or spiritual master, should be considered nondifferent
from Krsna—that is, he should be considered the incarnation of Lord Krsna's
potency. Such a personality is krsnalingita-vigraha—that is, he is always embraced
by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna. Such a person is above the con-
siderations of the varpasrama institution. He is the guru or spiritual master for the
entire world, a devotee on the topmost platform, the maha-bhagavata stage, and
a paramaharisa-thakura, a spiritual form only fit to be addressed as paramaharisa
or thakura.”

Nonetheless, there are many people who are just like owls but never open their
eyes to see the sunshine. These owlish personalities are inferior to the Mayavadi
sannyasis who cannot see the brilliance of Krsna's favor. They are prepared to
criticize the person engaged in distributing the holy name all over the world and
following in the footsteps of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who wanted Krsna con-
sciousness preached in every town and city.

TRANSLATION

When people came to Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu to discuss the principles of
various scriptures, the Lord defeated their false conclusions and established
the predominance of devotional service to the Lord. With logic and argument
He very politely changed their minds.

PURPORT

We have been spreading this sankirtana movement in the Western countries,
ard in our recent tour of European cities like Rome, Geneva, Paris and Frankfurt,
many learned Christian scholars, priests, philosophers and yogis came to see us,
and by the grace of Krsna they agreed that this Krsna consciousness movement,
the bhakti cult, offers the topmost conclusion. Following in the footsteps of Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu, we are trying to convince everyone that the devotional
service of the Lord is enjoined in every scripture. If a person is religious, he must
accept the supreme authority of the Lord, become His devotee and try to love
Him. This is the real principle of religion. It does not matter whether one is Chris-
tian, Mohammedan or whatever. He simply must accept the sublime position of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead and render service unto Him. It is not a ques-
tion of being Christian, Mohammedan or Hindu. One should be purely religious
and freed from all these material designations. In this way one can learn the art of
devotional service. This argument appeals to all intelligent men, and consequently
this Krsna consciousness movement is gaining ground throughout the world. Due
to our solid logic and scientific presentation, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu's predic-
tion that Krsna consciousness will spread in every town and village throughout
the world is gradually being realized.

Text 34] The Residents of Varanasi Become Vaisnavas 313
TRANSLATION

‘The word Brahman means ‘the greatest.’ This means that the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead is full in all six opulences. However, if we take the one-
sided impersonalist view, His fullness is diminished.

PURPORT
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is originally the Supreme Person. The Lord
says in Bhagavad-gita (9.4):
maya tatam ida sarvarmn
jagad avyakta-martina
mat-sthani sarva-bhatani
na cahar tesv avasthitah
“By Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded. All beings are
in Me, but | am not in them.”

The potency of Krsna that is spread everywhere is impersonal. The sunlight is
the impersonal expansion of the sun globe and the sun-god. If we simply take one
side of the Supreme Personality of Godhead —His impersonal effulgence —that
one side does not fully explain the Absolute Truth. Impersonal appreciation of the
Absolute Truth is one-sided and incomplete. One should also accept the other
side, the personal side —Bhagavan. Brahmeti paramatmeti bhagavan iti sabdyate.
One should not be satisfied simply by understanding the Brahman feature of the
Personality of Godhead. One must also know the Lord's personal feature. That is
complete understanding of the Absolute Truth.

TRANSLATION
“’Vedic literatures, the Upanisads, the Brahma-sitra and the Puranas all de-
scribe the activities of the spiritual potency of the Lord. If one cannot accept
the personal activities of the Lord, he jokes foolishly and gives an impersonal
description.
PURPORT
In the Vedic literatures, including the Puranas, there are full descriptions of the
spiritual potency of Krsna. All the pastimes of the Lord are eternal, blissful and full
of knowledge, just as the form of Krsna Himself is eternal, blissful and full of
knowledge (sac-cid-ananda-vigraha). Unintelligent people with a poor fund of
knowledge compare their temporary bodies to the spiritual body of Krsna, and by
such foolishness they try to understand Krsna as one of them. Avajananti mam
madha manusim tanum asritam. Bhagavad-gita (9.11) points out that foolish
people think of Krsna as one of them. Not understanding His spiritual potency,
they simply decry the personal form of the Absolute Truth, foolishly thinking of
themselves as jAanis cognizant of the complete truth. They cannot understand
that just as the material energy of the Lord has a variety of activities, the spiritual
energy has variety also. They consider activities in devotional service the same as
activities in material consciousness. Under such a wrong impression, they some-
times dare joke about the spiritual activities of the Lord and His devotional service.

৩10 Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s movement especially aims at defeating the
Mayavada conclusion about the Absolute Truth. Since the members of the
Mayavada school cannot understand the spiritual form of the Lord, they incor-
rectly think the Lord's form is also made of material energy. They think that He is
covered by a material body just like other living beings. Due to this offensive un-
derstanding, they cannot recognize that 5 Krsna’s personal form is transcenden-
tal, not material. Their conclusion is a great offense at the lotus feet of the Lord. As
explained by 511 Caitanya Mahaprabhu, Sri Krsna has His eternal, blissful form that
is full of knowledge, and all Vaisnava acaryas accept this. That is the proper under-
standing of the Absolute Truth.

Lord Brahma, who perfectly realized the Supreme Personality of Godhead after

realized that the form of the Lord is completely spiritual. This is certainly a better
understanding of the Absolute Truth than impersonal understanding.

PURPORT
Sripad Sankaracarya's propaganda opposed the atheistic philosophy of Buddha.
Lord Buddha's intention was to stop atheists from committing the sin of killing
animals. Atheists cannot understand God; therefore Lord Buddha appeared and
spread the philosophy of nonviolence to keep the atheists from killing animals.
Unless one is free from the sin of animal killing, he cannot understand religion or
God. Although Lord Buddha was an incarnation of Krsna, he did not speak about
Cod, for the people were unable to understand. He simply wanted to stop animal
killing. Sripad Sankaracarya wanted to establish the predominance of one's
spiritual identity; therefore he wanted to convert the atheists through an imagi-
nary interpretation of Vedic literatures. These are the secrets of the dcaryas. Some-
times they conceal the real purpose of the Vedas and explain the Vedas in a
different way. Sometimes they enunciate a different theory just to bring the
atheists under their control. Thus it is said that Sankara’s philosophy is for pasan-
das, atheists.

In his Amrta-pravaha-bhasya, Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura gives the following
summary of the six philosophical processes. Prakasananda admitted that Sripad
Sankaracarya, being very eager to establish his philosophy of monism, took shelter
of the Vedanta philosophy and tried to explain it in his own way. The fact is,
however, that if one accepts the existence of God, he certainly cannot establish
the theory of monism. For this reason Sankaracarya refuted all kinds of Vedic


--- Page 328 ---
Text 56] The Residents of Varanasi Become Vaisnavas 327
literature that establishes the supremacy of the Personality of Godhead. In various
ways, Sankaracarya has tried to refute Vedic literature. Throughout the world,
ninety-nine percent of the philosophers following in the footsteps of
Sankaracarya refuse to accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Instead they
try to establish their own opinions. It is typical of mundane philosophers to want
to establish their own opinions and refute those of others. Therefore: (1) The
Mimarhsaka philosophers, following the principles of Jaimini, stress fruitive activity
and say that if there is a God, He must be under the laws of fruitive activity. In
other words, if one performs his duties very nicely in the material world, God is
obliged to give one the desired result. According to these philosophers, there is
no need to become a devotee of God. If one strictly follows moral principles, one
will be recognized by the Lord, who will give the desired reward. Such
philosophers do not accept the Vedic principle of bhakti-yoga. Instead, they give
stress to following one’s prescribed duty. (2) Atheistic Sankhya philosophers like
Kapila analyze the material elements very scrutinizingly and thereby come to the
conclusion that material nature is the cause of everything. They do not accept the
Supreme Personality of Godhead as the cause of all causes. (3) Nyaya
philosophers like Gautama and Kanada have accepted a combination of atoms as
the original cause of the creation. (4) Mayavadi philosophers say that everything
is an illusion. Headed by philosophers like Astavakra, they stress the impersonal
Brahman effulgence as the cause of everything. (5) Philosophers following the
precepts of Patafjali practice rdja-yoga. They imagine a form of the Absolute
Truth within many forms. That is their process of self-realization.

All five of these philosophies completely reject the predominance of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead and strive to establish their own philosophical
theories. However, Srila Vyasadeva wrote the Vedanta-satra and, taking the
essence of all Vedic literature, established the supremacy of the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead. All five of the philosophers mentioned above understand
that impersonal Brahman is without material qualities, and they believe that when
the Personality of Godhead appears, He is contaminated and covered by the
material qualities. The technical term used is saguna. They say, “saguna Brahman’
and “nirguna Brahman.” Nirguna Brahman means impersonal, and saguna Brahman
means “accepting material contamination.” More or less, this kind of philosophical
speculation is called Mayavada philosophy. The fact is, however, that the Ab-
solute Truth has nothing to do with material qualities because He is transcenden-
tal. He is always complete with full spiritual qualities. The five philosophers men-
tioned above do not accept Lord Visnu as the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
but they are very busy refuting the philosophy of other schools. There are six
kinds of philosophical processes in India. Because Vyasadeva is the Vedic
authority, he is known as Vedavyasa. His philosophical explanation of the Ve-
danta-satra is accepted by the devotees. As Krsna confirms in Bhagavad-gita
(15.15):

The ultimate goal of studying all Vedic literature is the acceptance of Krsna as
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This Krsna consciousness movement is
propagating the philosophical conclusion of Srila Vyasadeva and following other
great acaryas like Ramanujacarya, Madhvacarya, Visnusvami, Nimbarka and $ri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu Himself.

TRANSLATION

‘ ‘Dry arguments are inconclusive. A great personality whose opinion does
not differ from others is not considered a great sage. Simply by studying the
Vedas, which are variegated, one cannot come to the right path by which
religious principles are understood. The solid truth of religious principles is
hidden in the heart of an unadulterated self-realized person. Consequently, as
the sastras confirm, one should accept whatever progressive path the maha-
janas advocate.’

^“ ‘Being touched by the lotus feet of Sri Krsna, that serpent was im-
mediately freed from the reactions of his sinful life. Thus the serpent gave up
his body and assumed the body of a beautiful Vidyadhara demigod.”"’
PURPORT
This is a quotation from Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.34.9). The inhabitants of
Vrndavana, under the leadership of Nanda Maharaja, once wanted to go to the
bank of the Sarasvati on a pilgrimage. Nanda Maharaja was fasting, and he lay
down near the forest. At that time a serpent, who was formerly cursed by
Angirasa Rsi, appeared. This serpent had formerly been named Sudar$ana, and he
had belonged to the Gandharvaloka planet. However, because he joked with the
rsi, he was condemned to take on the body of a big snake. When this serpent at-
tacked Nanda Maharaja, Nanda Maharaja began to call, “Krsna! Help!” Krsna im-
mediately appeared and began to kick the serpent with His lotus feet. Due to
being touched by the Lord's lotus feet, the serpent was immediately freed from
the reactions of his sinful life. Being freed, he again assumed his original form of
Sudariana, the Gandharva.

TRANSLATION
When Prakasananda Sarasvati supported himself by quoting the verse from
Srimad-Bhagavatam, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu immediately protested by ut-
tering the holy name of Lord Visnu. The Lord then presented Himself as a most
fallen living entity, and He said, ‘If someone accepts a fallen conditioned soul
as Visnu, Bhagavan, or an incarnation, he commits a great offense.”
PURPORT
Although Sr Caitanya Mahaprabhu was Visnu, the Supreme Personality of
Codhead, He nonetheless, to teach us a lesson, denied belonging to the Visnu
category. Unfortunately, there are many so-called Visnu incarnations in this age of
Kali. People do not know that posing oneself as an incarnation is most offensive.
People should not accept an ordinary man as an incarnation of God, for this also is
a very great offense.

sidered an offender and atheist.

346 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 25
Brahma-siitra is very grave because its author, Vyasadeva, is the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead Himself.
PURPORT
An ordinary living being cannot actually understand the purpose of the Ve-
danta-satra. One can understand the purpose if he hears it from the authority,
Vyasadeva himself. For this reason, Vyasadeva gave a commentary on the
Brahma-satra in the form of Srimad-Bhagavatam. He had been instructed to do this
by his spiritual master, Narada. Of course, Sankaracarya distorted the purpose of
the Brahma-sdatra because he had a motive to serve. He wanted to establish Vedic
knowledge in place of the atheistic knowledge spread by Lord Buddha. All these
necessities are there according to time and circumstances. Neither Lord Buddha
nor Sankaracarya is to be blamed. The time required such an explanation for the
understanding of various types of atheists. The conclusion is that one cannot un-
derstand the purpose of the Vedanta-satra without going through the Srimad-
Bhagavatam and rendering devotional service. Caitanya Mahaprabhu therefore
further explains the matter in the following verses.

“The purpose of the Vedanta-sutra is very difficult for an ordinary person to
understand, but Vyasadeva, out of his causeless mercy, has personally ex-
plained the meaning.

TRANSLATION
“Srila Vyasadeva considered that whatever he had received from Narada
Muni as an explanation of orhkara he would elaborately explain in his book
Srimad-Bhagavatam as a commentary on Brahma-satra.
PURPORT
The sound vibration omkara is the root of Vedic knowledge. This orikara is
known as maha-vakya, or the supreme sound. Whatever meaning is in the
supreme sound orfkara is further understood in the Gayatri mantra. Again, this
same meaning is explained in Srimad-Bhagavatam in the four slokas known as
catuh-sloki, which begin with the words ahar evasam evagre. The Lord says,
“Only 1 existed before the creation.” From this verse, four slokas have been com-
posed, and these are known as the catuh-sloki. In this way the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead informed Lord Brahma about the purpose of the catuh-sloki.
Again, Lord Brahma explained this to Narada Muni, and Narada Muni explained it
to Srila Vyasadeva. This is the parampara system, the disciplic succession. The im-
port of Vedic knowledge, the original word pranava, has been explained in
Srimad-Bhagavatam. The conclusion is that the Brahma-sitra is explained in the
Srimad-Bhagavatam.

PURPORT
This is a quotation from $rimad-Bhagavatam (8.1.10). Communists and socialists
are trying to propagate the philosophy that everything belongs to the mass of
people or to the state. Such an idea is not perfect. When this idea is expanded, we
can see that everything belongs to God. That will be the perfection of the com-
munistic idea. The purpose of Srimad-Bhagavatam is here very nicely explained.
Every one of us must be satisfied with those things the Supreme Personality of
Godhead has allotted us. We should not encroach upon the possessions of
others. This simple idea can be expanded in our daily lives. Everyone should have
a piece of land given by the government, and everyone should possess a few
cows. Both of these should be utilized for one’s daily bread. Above that, if some-
thing is manufactured in a factory, it should be considered the property of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead because the ingredients belong to the Supreme
Lord. Actually, there is no need to manufacture such things artificially, but if it is
done, one should consider that the goods produced belong to the Supreme Lord.
Spiritual communism recognizes the supreme proprietorship of the Supreme Lord.
As explained in Bhagavad-gita (5.29):
bhoktararn yajia-tapasam
sarva-loka-mahesvaram
suhrdam sarva-bhatanam
jAdtva marn santim rcchati
“The sages, knowing Me as the ultimate purpose of all sacrifices and austerities,
the Supreme Lord of all planets and demigods and the benefactor and well-wisher
of all living entities, attain peace from the pangs of material miseries.”
Itis further explained in Srimad-Bhagavatam that no one should claim anything
as his property. Whatever property one claims to be his actually belongs to Krsna.


--- Page 353 ---
352 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 25
One should be satisfied with whatever has been allotted by the Supreme Lord
and should not encroach upon the property of others. This will lead to peace in
the whole world.

Spiritual knowledge means fully understanding the Absolute Truth in three
features—impersonal Brahman, localized Paramatma and the all-powerful
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Ultimately when one takes shelter at the lotus
feet of the Supreme Personality of Codhead and engages in the Lord's service, the
resultant knowledge is called vijiiana, special knowledge, or the practical applica-
tion of spiritual knowledge. One should be engaged in the Lord's devotional ser-
vice to achieve the aim of life, called prayojana. The practice of devotional service
to attain that goal of life is called abhidheya.

order to impress upon them the necessity of accepting Him. Therefore the
word ‘“aham’’ is mentioned three times. To stress something important, one
repeats it three times.

PURPORT
Real spiritual knowledge has to be received from revealed scriptures. After this
knowledge is attained, one can begin to perceive his actual spiritual life. Any
knowledge achieved by speculation is imperfect. One must receive knowledge
from the parampara system and from the guru, otherwise one will be bewildered,
and will ultimately become an impersonalist. When one very scrutinizingly
deliberates, he can realize the personal feature of the Absolute Truth. The
Supreme Personality of Godhead is always transcendental to this material cre-
ation. Nardyanah paro ’'vyaktat: Narayana, the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
is always transcendental. He is not a creation of this material world. Without
realizing spiritual knowledge, one cannot understand that the transcendental
form of the Lord is always beyond the creative energy. The example of the sun
and sunshine is given. The sunshine is not the sun, but still the sunshine is not
separate from the sun. The philosophy of acintya-bhedabheda-tattva
(simultaneously one and different) cannot be understood by one who is fully
under the influence of the external energy. Consequently a person under the in-
fluence of the material energy cannot understand the nature and form of the Per-
sonality of the Absolute Truth.

PURPORT
The cult of bhagavata-dharma can be spread in all circumstances, among all
people and in all countries. Many envious people accuse this Krsna consciousness
movement of spoiling the rigidity of so-called Hinduism. That is not actually the
fact. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu confirms that devotional service to the Lord —the
cult of bhagavata-dharma, which is now being spread as the Hare Krsna move-
ment—can be spread in every country, for every person, in any condition of life,
and in all circumstances. Bhagavata-dharma does not restrict pure devotees to the
Hindu community. A pure devotee is above a brahmana; therefore it is not incom-
patible to offer the sacred thread to devotees in Europe, America, Australia, Japan,
Canada, and so on. Sometimes these pure devotees, who have been accepted by
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, are not allowed to enter certain temples in India. Some
high-caste brahmanas and gosvamis refuse to take prasada in the temples of the
International Society for Krishna Consciousness. Actually this is against the in-
struction of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Devotees can come from any country, and
they can belong to any creed or race. On the strength of this verse, those who are
actually devotees and followers of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu must accept devo-
tees from all parts of the world as pure Vaisnavas. They should be accepted not
artificially but factually. One should see how they are advanced in Krsna con-
sciousness and how they are conducting Deity worship, sankirtana and Ratha-
yatra. Considering all these points, an envious person should refrain from
malicious atrocities.

however, there are no such considerations. Devotional service is transcenden-
tal to all considerations.

PURPORT

When we are on the material platform, there are different types of religions—
Hinduism, Christianity, Mohammedanism, Buddhism, and so on. These are
instituted for a particular time, a particular country or a particular person.
Consequently there are differences. Christian principles are different from Hindu
principles, and Hindu principles are different from Mohammedan and Buddhist
principles. These may be considered on the material platform, but when we come
to the platform of transcendental devotional service, there are no such considera-
tions. The transcendental service of the Lord (sadhana-bhakti) is above these prin-
ciples. The world is anxious for religious unity, and that common platform can be
achieved in transcendental devotional service. This is the verdict of Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu. When one becomes a Vaisnava, he becomes transcendental to all
these limited considerations. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (14.26):

marn ca yo 'vyabhicarena
bhakti-yogena sevate
sa gunan samatityaitan
brahma-bhayaya kalpate
“One who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any cir-
cumstance, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to
the level of Brahman.”

The devotional activities of the Krsna consciousness movement are completely
transcendental to material considerations. As far as different faiths are concerned,
religions may be of different types, but on the spiritual platform, everyone has an
equal right to execute devotional service. That is the platform of oneness and the
basis for a classless society. In his Amrta-pravaha-bhasya, Srila Bhaktivinoda
Thakura confirms that one has to learn from a bona fide spiritual master about
religious principles, economic development, sense gratification and ultimately
liberation. These are the four divisions of regulated life, but they are sub-
jected to the material platform. On the spiritual platform, the four principles are
jana, vijiana, tad-ariga and tad-rahasya. Rules, regulations and restrictions are on
the material platform, but on the spiritual platform one has to be equipped with
transcendental knowledge, which is above the principles of religious rituals. Mun-
dane religious activity is known as smarta-viddhi, but transcendental devotional
service is called gosvami-viddhi. Unfortunately many so-called gosvamis are on
the platform of smarta-viddhi, yet they try to pass as gosvami-viddhi, and thus the
people are cheated. Cosvami-viddhi is strictly explained in Sanatana Cosvami's
Hari-bhakti-vilasa, wherein it is stated:

The conclusion is that devotional service is open for everyone, regardless of
caste, creed, time and country. This Krsna consciousness movement is functioning
according to this principle.

TRANSLATION
‘ ‘When the living entity is attracted by the material energy, which is sepa-
rate from Krsna, he is overpowered by fear. Because he is separated from the
Supreme Personality of Godhead by the material energy, his conception of life
is reversed. In other words, instead of being the eternal servant of Krsna, he
becomes Krsna’s competitor. This is called viparyayo ‘smrtih. To nullify this
mistake, one who is actually learned and advanced worships the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead as his spiritual master, worshipful Deity and source of
life. He thus worships the Lord by the process of unalloyed devotional
service.’

Mahaprabhu; aila vasa-aghara—came to His residential place; varanasi—the city
of Varanasi; haila—became; dvitiya—second; nadiya-nagara—Navadvipa

TRANSLATION

Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu then returned to His residence with His personal
associates. Thus He turned the whole city of Varanasi into another Navadvipa
[Nadiya-nagaral.

PURPORT

Both Navadvipa and Varanasi were celebrated for their highly educational ac-
tivities. At the present time these cities are still inhabited by great, learned
scholars, but Varanasi is especially a center for Mayavadi sannyasis who are
learned scholars. However, unlike Navadvipa, there are hardly any devotees in
Varanasi. Consequently a discussion of Srimad-Bhagavatam was very rare in
Varanasi. In Navadvipa, such a discussion was quite ordinary. After Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu visited Varanasi and turned Prakasananda Sarasvati and his disciples
into Vaisnavas, Varanasi became like Navadvipa because so many devotees
began discussing Srimad-Bhagavatam. Even at the present moment one can hear
many discussions on Srimad-Bhagavatam taking place on the banks of the Ganges.
Many scholars and sannyasis gather there to hear Srimad-Bhagavatam and per-
form sankirtana.

PURPORT
When we began distributing the message of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu in the
Western countries, a similar thing happened. In the beginning we were very dis-
appointed for at least one year because no one came forth to help this move-
ment, but by the grace of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, some young boys joined this
movement in 1966. Of course we distributed Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s message


--- Page 394 ---

of the Hare Krsna maha-mantra without bargaining or selling. As a result, this
movement has spread all over the world, with the assistance of European and
American boys and girls. We therefore pray for all the blessings of Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu upon all the devotees in the Western world who are spreading this
movement.

Following in the footsteps of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, we have constructed
temples both in Vrndavana and Mayapur, Navadvipa, just to give shelter to the
foreign devotees coming from Europe and America. Since the Hare Krsna move-
ment started, many Europeans and Americans have been visiting Vrndavana, but
they have not been properly received by any asrama or temple there. It is the pur-
pose of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness to give them shelter
and train them in devotional service. There are also many tourists eager to come

SYNONYMS
stri—the wife; marite cahe—wants to kill Subuddhi Raya; raja—the King; san-

TRANSLATION
This became a perplexing problem for him because his wife kept
requesting him to kill Subuddhi Raya. Finally the Nawab sprinkled a little
water on Subuddhi Raya’s head from a pitcher that had been used by a
Mohammedan.
PURPORT
More than five hundred years ago in India, the Hindus were so rigid and strict
that if a Mohammedan would sprinkle a little water from his pitcher upon a Hindu,
the Hindu would be immediately ostracized. Recently, in 1947, during the parti-
san days, there was a big riot between Hindus and Muslims, especially in Bengal.
The Hindus were forcibly made to eat cow's flesh, and consequently they began
crying, thinking that they had become Mohammedans. Actually the Moham-
medans in India did not come from the country of the Mohammedans, but Hindus
instituted the custom that somehow or other if one contacted a Mohammedan,
he became a Mohammedan. Rapa and Sanatana Gosvami were born in a high
brahmana family, but because they accepted employment under a Mohammedan
government, they were considered Mohammedans. Subuddhi Raya was sprinkled
with water from the pitcher of a Mohammedan, and consequently he was con-
demned to have become a Mohammedan. Later, Aurangzeb, the Mohammedan
emperor, introduced a tax especially meant for Hindus. Being oppressed in the
Hindu community, many low-caste Hindus preferred to become Mohammedans.
In this way the Mohammedan population increased. Later the British government
made it a policy to divide the Hindus and the Muslims, and thus they maintained
ill feelings between them. The result was that India was divided into Pakistan and
Hindustan.
From early histories it appears that the entire earth was under one culture,
Vedic culture, but gradually, due to religious and cultural divisions, the rule


--- Page 405 ---
404 Sri Caitanya-caritaimrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 25
fragmented into many subdivisions. Now the earth is divided into many countries,
religions and political parties. Despite these political and religious divisions, we ad-
vocate that everyone should unite again under one culture —Krsna consciousness.
People should accept one God, Krsna; one scripture, Bhagavad-gita; and one ac-
tivity, devotional service to the Lord. Thus people may live happily upon this earth
and combine to produce sufficient food. In such a society, there would be no
question of scarcity, famine, or cultural or religious degradation. So-called caste
systems and national divisions are artificial. According to our Vaisnava philosophy,
these are all external bodily designations. The Krsna consciousness movement is
not based upon bodily designations. It is a transcendental movement on the plat-
form of spiritual understanding. If the people of the world understood that the
basic principle of life is spiritual identification, they would understand that the
business of the spirit soul is to serve the Supreme Spirit, Krsna. As Lord Krsna says
in Bhagavad-gita (15.7), mamaivarmso jiva-loke jiva-bhatah sanatanah: “The living
entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental parts.” All living en-
tities in different life forms are sons of Krsna. Therefore they are all meant to serve
Krsna, the original supreme father. If this philosophy is accepted, the failure of the
United Nations to unite all nations will be sufficiently compensated all over the
world by a great Krsna consciousness movement. Recently we had talks with
Christian leaders in Australia, including the Bishop of Australia, and everyone
there was pleased with our philosophy of oneness in religious consciousness.

TRANSLATION
Taking the Nawab’s sprinkling water upon him as an opportunity, Subuddhi
Raya left his family and business affairs and went to Varanasi.
PURPORT
It appears that Subuddhi Raya was a big landholder and a responsible, respect-
able gentleman. He could not, however, avoid the social misconception that one

becomes a Mohammedan when water is sprinkled on one’s face from a Moham-
medan’s pitcher. Actually he was planning to give up his material life and leave his
family. Hindu culture recommends four divisions— brahmacarya, grhastha,
vanaprastha and sannyasa. Subuddhi Raya was thinking of taking sannyasa, and by
the grace of Krsna, he received this opportunity. He therefore left his family and
went to Varanasi. The system of varpasrama-dharma is very scientific. If one is
directed by the varpasrama institution, he will naturally think of retiring from
family life at the end of his life. Therefore sannyasa is compulsory at the age of
fifty.

When Subuddhi Raya consulted some other brahmanas, they told him that
he had not committed a grievous fault and that consequently he should not
drink hot ghee and give up his life. As a result, Subuddhi Raya was doubtful
about what to do.
PURPORT
This is another instance of Hindu custom. One brahmana would give advice
condoning a particular fault, and another would give advice to the contrary.
Typically, lawyers and physicians differ, giving one kind of instruction and then
another. Due to the brahmanas’ different opinions, Subuddhi Raya became further
perplexed. He did not know what to do or what not to do.

SYNONYMS
prabhu  kahe—the Lord advised; ihan haite—from this place; yaha’
vindavana—go to Vrndavana; nirantara—incessantly; kara—perform; krsna-
nama-sankirtana—chanting of the holy name of Krsna.
TRANSLATION
The Lord advised him, “Go to Vrndavana and chant the Hare Krsna mantra
constantly.”
PURPORT
This is a solution to all sinful activities. In this age of Kali everyone is perplexed
by so many inconveniences —social, political and religious —and naturally no one
is happy. Due to the contamination of this age, everyone has a very short life.
There are many fools and rascals who advise people to adopt this way of life or
that way of life, but real liberation from life's perplexities means preparation for
the next life. Tatha dehantara-praptir dhiras tatra na muhyati. One should be situ-
ated in his spiritual identity and return home, back to Godhead. The simplest
method for this is recommended herein by $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. We should
constantly chant the holy names of the Lord, the Hare Krsna maha-mantra.
Following in the footsteps of Sif Caitanya Mahaprabhu, this Krsna consciousness
movement is recommending this process all over the world. We are saying,
“Chant the Hare Krsna maha-mantra, be freed from all the complexities of life and
realize Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Engage in His devotional ser-
vice and perfect your life so that you can return home, back to Godhead.”

Lord; krsna-carana paibe—you will get shelter at the lotus feet of Krsna.
TRANSLATION
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu further advised Subuddhi Raya: “8০511 chanting
the Hare Krsna mantra, and when your chanting is almost pure, all your sinful


--- Page 409 ---
408 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 25
reactions will go away. After you chant perfectly, you will get shelter at the
lotus feet of Krsna.
PURPORT
The ten kinds of offenses should be considered. In the beginning, when one is
initiated into the chanting of the Hare Krsna maha-mantra, there are naturally
many offenses. However, the devotee should be very careful to avoid these
offenses and chant purely. This does not mean that the Hare Krsna maha-mantrais
sometimes pure and sometimes impure. Rather, the chanter is impure due to
material contamination. He has to purify himself so that the holy names will be
perfectly effective. Chanting the holy name of the Lord inoffensively will help one
get immediate shelter at Krsna's lotus feet. This means that by chanting purely,
one will immediately be situated on the transcendental platform. We should note,
however, that according to 5 Caitanya Mahaprabhu'’s instructions, one should
not wait to purify himself before chanting the Hare Krsna mantra. Whatever our
condition may be, we should begin chanting immediately. By the power of the
Hare Krsna mantra, we will gradually be relieved from all material contamination
and will get shelter at the lotus feet of Krsna, the ultimate goal of life.

Text 206] The Residents of Varanasi Become Vaisnavas 411
PURPORT
In those days there was no banking system like the one now found in Western
countries. If one had excess money, he would deposit it with some merchant,
usually a grocer. That was the banking system. Subuddhi Raya would deposit his
extra money with a mercantile man and spend it when necessary. When one is in
the renounced order, saving money is not recommended. However, if one saves
money for the service of the Lord or a Vaisnava, that is accepted. These are the
dealings of Subuddhi Raya, who is one of the confidential devotees of Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Srila Rapa Gosvami also followed this principle by
spending fifty percent of his money in order to serve Krsna through brahmanas
and Vaisnavas. He gave twenty-five percent of his money to relatives, and
twenty-five percent he deposited in the custody of a merchant. These are the ap-
proved methods recommended in Caitanya-caritamrta. Whether in the
renounced order or in the grhastha order, a Vaisnava should follow these
principles set forth by the previous acaryas.

karana bhojana—gives food for eating; gaudiya aile—when a Bengali Vaisnava

TRANSLATION
Subuddhi Riya used to spend his savings to supply yogurt to Bengali
Vaisnavas who came to Mathura. He also gave them cooked rice and oil
massages. When he saw a poverty-stricken Vaisnava, he would use his money
to feed him.
PURPORT
There is a special reference for the maintenance of Bengali Vaisnavas. A
Gaudiya Vaisnava is a Bengali Vaisnava. Most of the devotees of Lord Caitanya at
that time were Caudiyas and Oriyas, inhabitants of Bengal and Orissa. There are
still many hundreds and thousands of disciples in Bengal and Orissa. Bengalis are
habituated to eating cooked rice as their staple food. When they went to


--- Page 413 ---
412 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 25
Mathura in the North, they found that the people generally ate chapatis or roti
made of wheat. The Bengalis could not digest this food because they were used
to cooked rice. Therefore as soon as Subuddhi Raya saw a Bengali Vaisnava ar-
riving in Mathura, he would try to supply him with cooked rice. Bengalis are also
accustomed to taking a massage with mustard oil. In any case, Subuddhi Raya
wanted to serve the Vaisnavas according to their needs. Therefore he would sup-
ply yogurt to ease the digestion of food eaten in Mathura, particularly the wheat-
made chapatis and roti.

Srila Rapa Gosvami had been a minister in the government of Hussain Shah, and
Subuddhi Raya was also known to Hussain Shah, because as a boy, he had been
Subuddhi Raya’s servant. It appears that Subuddhi Raya was elderly, yet while he
was living in Mathura he showed Rapa Gosvami the twelve forests of Vrndavana.

TRANSLATION

To deliver all fallen souls, the Lord traveled from country to country. He
personally tasted the transcendental pleasure of devotional service, and He
simultaneously spread the cult of devotion everywhere.

PURPORT

Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu personally traveled to different regions of India to
spread the bhakti cult throughout the country. He also personally relished tran-
scendental activities. By His personal behavior He has given an example for devo-
tees to follow. That is, one should broadcast the cult of devotional service. He
specifically instructed His devotees to enjoin all Indians to broadcast this message
throughout the world because at that time the Lord could not personally travel to
other parts of the world. In this regard, He has left two instructions:

bharata-bhamite haila manusya-janma yara
janma sarthaka kari’ kara para-upakara
“All Indians should seriously take up the cult of इनं Caitanya Mahaprabhu and
should perfect their lives by adopting the process of devotional service. After per-
fecting their lives, they should broadcast this message all over the world for the
welfare of all human beings [para-upakaral.” (Cc. Adi 9.41) A Vaisnava is
especially interested in para-upakara, doing good to others. Prahlada Maharaja
was also interested in this. He did not want to be delivered alone; rather, he
wanted to deliver all fallen souls, who are bereft of knowledge of bhakti and who
misuse their intelligence for the temporary benefit of the material body. Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu also wanted His mission spread all over the world.
prthivite ache yata nagaradi grama
sarvatra pracara haibe mora nama
“In every town and village, the chanting of My name will be heard.”

Following in His footsteps, we are trying to broadcast His message throughout
the world. By His mercy, people are taking this movement very seriously. Indeed,
our books are extensively distributed in the Western countries, especially in
America and Europe. Even the ecclesiastical orders in these countries are ap-
preciating the value of this Krsna consciousness movement and are ready to unite
for the highest benefit of human society. The followers of Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu may therefore take this movement seriously and broadcast it
throughout the world, from village to village and from town to town, just as Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu Himself did.

442 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 25
PURPORT
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (7.3):
manusyanam sahasresu
kascid yatati siddhaye
yatatam api siddhanar
kascin marh vetti tattvatah
“Out of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection, and of
those who have achieved perfection, hardly one knows Me in truth.” =
It is very difficult to understand Krsna, but if one tries to understand Srimad-
Bhagavatam through Caitanya Mahaprabhu's bhakti cult, one will undoubtedly
understand Krsna very easily. If somehow or other one understands Krsna, his life
will be successful. Again, as stated in Bhagavad-gita (4.9):
janma karma ca me divyam
eva yo vetti tattvatah
tyaktva deham punar janma
naiti mam eti so ‘rjuna
“One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does
not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains
My eternal abode, O Arjuna.”

TRANSLATION

The pastimes of Lord Krsna are the essence of all nectar. They flow in
hundreds of rivulets and in all directions. The pastimes of Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu are an eternal reservoir, and one is advised to let his mind swim
like a swan on this transcendental lake.

PURPORT

The essence of spiritual knowledge is found in the pastimes of Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu, which are identical with the pastimes of Lord Krsna. This is the
essence of knowledge. If knowledge does not include the understanding of $ri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu and Krsna, it is simply superfluous. By Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu’s grace, the nectar of Lord 11 Krsna’s pastimes is flowing in different
directions in hundreds and thousands of rivers. One should not think that the
pastimes of $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu are different from Krsna’s pastimes. It is said:
$ri-krsna-caitanya, radha-krsna nahe anya. Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu is a com-
bination of Radha-Krsna, and without understanding His pastimes, one cannot un-
derstand Radha and Krsna. Srila Narottama dasa Thakura therefore sings: rapa-
raghunatha-pade haibe akuti/ kabe hama bujhaba se yugala piriti. “When shall |
become very eager to study the books left by the six Gosvamis? Then I shall be
able to understand the conjugal pastimes of Radha and Krsna.” Caitanya
Mahaprabhu directly empowered Srila Ripa Gosvami and Srila Sanatana Gosvami.
Following in their footsteps, the other six Gosvamis understood Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu and His mission. One should understand ri Krsna Caitanya and Lord
6 Krsna from the Gosvamis in the parampara system. This Krsna consciousness
movement is following as strictly as possible in the footsteps of the Gosvamis.
Narottama dasa Thakura says, ei chaya 8০537 yanra, mui tanra dasa: | am the ser-
vant of the six Gosvamis.” The philosophy of Krsna consciousness is to become
the servant of the servant of the servant of the Lord. Whoever wants to under-
stand the difficult subject matter of krsna-katha should accept the disciplic suc-
cession. If one is somehow or other able to understand Krsna, his life will be suc-
cessful. Tyaktva deham punar janma naiti mam eti 50 ‘rjuna. A perfect devotee is
able to understand Krsna through the disciplic succession, and his entrance into
the kingdom of Cod is thereby certainly opened. When one understands Krsna,
there is no difficulty in transferring oneself to the spiritual kingdom.

lotus flowers and jubilantly enjoy ecstatic love of Krsna day and night, their
mental speculation will be completely transcendentally satisfied.

The devotees who have a relationship with Krsna are like the swans and
cakravaka birds that play in the forest of lotus flowers. The buds of those lotus
flowers are the pastimes of Krsna, and they are edibles for the swanlike devo-
tees. Lord Sri Krsna is always engaged in His transcendental pastimes;
therefore the devotees, following in the footsteps of Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu, can always eat those lotus buds, for they are the pastimes of the
Lord.

Men become strong and stout by eating sufficient grains, but the devotee

drop of the nectar of Krsna’s pastimes, his body and mind begin to bloom, and
he begins to laugh, sing and dance.
PURPORT
All the devotees connected with this Krsna consciousness movement must
read all the books that have been translated (Caitanya-caritamrta, Srimad-
Bhagavatam, Bhagavad-gita and others); otherwise, after some time, they will
simply eat, sleep and fall down from their position. Thus they will miss the oppor-
tunity to attain an eternal, blissful life of transcendental pleasure.

their enjoyment more and more.

Note:

The author of $ri Caitanya-caritamrta, Krsnadasa Kavirdgja Gosvami, has con-
demned all his enemies by comparing them to envious hogs and pigs. This Krsna
consciousness movement, which is spreading throughout the world, is being ap-
preciated by sincere people, although they have never previously heard of Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu and Krsna's pastimes. Now even the higher, priestly circles
are appreciating this movement. They have concluded that this movement is very
nice and that they have something to learn from it. Nonetheless, in India there are
some people who say that they belong to this cult but who are actually very en-
vious of the acarya. They have tried to suppress our activities in many ways, but
as far as we are concerned, we follow in the footsteps of Krsnadasa Kavirdja
Gosvami and take them as envious pigs and hogs. We simply wish to present the
pastimes of Lord Krsna and $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu to the best of our ability so
that those who are really honest can cleanse their hearts. We hope that they en-
joy this literature and bestow their blessings upon us. It appears that even such a
great personality as Krsnadasa Kavirdja Gosvami met with some envious ob-
stacles; what, then, to speak of us, who are only insignificant creatures in this
universe. We are simply trying to execute the orders of our spiritual master to the
best of our ability.

The Author

His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada appeared in this world
in 1896 in Calcutta, India. He first met his spiritual master, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta
Sarasvati Gosvami, in Calcutta in 1922. Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati, a prominent
devotional scholar and the founder of sixty-four Gaudiya Mathas (Vedic In-
stitutes), liked this educated young man and convinced him to dedicate his life to
teaching Vedic knowledge. Srila Prabhupada became his student, and eleven
years later (1933) at Allahabad he became his formally initiated disciple.

At their first meeting, in 1922, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura requested
Srila Prabhupada to broadcast Vedic knowledge through the English language. In
the years that followed, Srila Prabhupada wrote a commentary on the Bhagavad-
gita, assisted the Gaudiya Matha in its work and, in 1944, without assistance,
started an English fortnightly magazine, edited it, typed the manuscripts and
checked the galley proofs. He even distributed the individual copies freely and
struggled to maintain the publication. Once begun, the magazine never stopped;
it is now being continued by his disciples in the West.

Recognizing Srila Prabhupada’s philosophical learning and devotion, the
Gaudiya Vaisnava Society honored him in 1947 with the title “Bhaktivedanta.” In
1950, at the age of fifty-four, Srila Prabhupada retired from married life, and four
years later he adopted the vanaprastha (retired) order to devote more time to his
studies and writing. Srila Prabhupada traveled to the holy city of Vindavana,
where he lived in very humble circumstances in the historic medieval temple of
Radha-Damodara. There he engaged for several years in deep study and writing.
He accepted the renounced order of life (sannyasa) in 1959. At Radha-Damodara,
Srila Prabhupada began work on his life's masterpiece: a multivolume translation
and commentary on the eighteen thousand verse Srimad-Bhagavatam
(Bhagavata Purana). He also wrote Easy Journey to Other Planets.

After publishing three volumes of Bhagavatam, Srila Prabhupada came to the
United States, in 1965, to fulfill the mission of his spiritual master. Since that time,
His Divine Grace has written over forty volumes of authoritative translations,
commentaries and summary studies of the philosophical and religious classics of
India.

In 1965, when he first arrived by freighter in New York City, Srila Prabhupada
was practically penniless. It was after almost a year of great difficulty that he
established the International Society for Krishna Consciousness in July of 1966.
Under his careful guidance, the Society has grown within a decade to a world-
wide confederation of almost one hundred dsramas, schools, temples, institutes
and farm communities.

In 1968, Srila Prabhupada created New Vrndavana, an experimental Vedic com-
munity in the hills of West Virginia. Inspired by the success of New Vrndavana,
now a thriving farm community of more than one thousand acres, his students
have since founded several similar communities in the United States and abroad.

516 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta

In 1972, His Divine Grace introduced the Vedic system of primary and second-
ary education in the West by founding the Gurukula school in Dallas, Texas. The
school began with 3 children in 1972, and by the beginning of 1975 the enroll-
ment had grown to 150.

Srila Prabhupada has also inspired the construction of a large international
center at Sridhama Mayapur in West Bengal, India, which is also the site for a
planned Institute of Vedic Studies. A similar project is the magnificent Krsna-
Balarama Temple and International Guest House in Vrndavana, India. These are
centers where Westerners can live to gain firsthand experience of Vedic culture.

Srila Prabhupada’s most significant contribution, however, is his books. Highly
respected by the academic community for their authoritativeness, depth and
clarity, they are used as standard textbooks in numerous college courses. His
writings have been translated into eleven languages. The Bhaktivedanta Book
Trust, established in 1972 exclusively to publish the works of His Divine Grace,
has thus become the world’s largest publisher of books in the field of Indian
religion and philosophy. Its latest project is the publishing of Srila Prabhupada’s
most recent work: a seventeen-volume translation and commentary —completed
by Srila Prabhupada in only eighteen months—on the Bengali religious classic Sri
Caitanya-caritamrta.

In the past ten years, in spite of his advanced age, Srila Prabhupada has circled
the globe twelve times on lecture tours that have taken him to six continents. In
spite of such a vigorous schedule, Srila Prabhupada continues to write prolifically.
His writings constitute a veritable library of Vedic philosophy, religion, literature
and culture.

(continued from front flap)

Madhya-Ilila (the middle period), the
longest of the three, is a detailed narration of
Sri Caitanya’s extensive and eventful travels
throughout India as a renounced mendicant,
teacher, philosopher, spiritual preceptor and
mystic. Finally, Antya-lila (the final period)
concerns the last eighteen years of Caitanya
Mahaprabhu’s manifest presence, spent in
semiseclusion in Jagannatha Puri, Orissa.
During these final years, Sri Caitanya drifted
deeper and deeper into trances of spiritual
ecstasy unparalleled in all of religious and
literary history, Eastern or Western.

„ Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami, the author of
Sri Caitanya-caritamrta, was a greatsaint and
a confidential disciple and student of
Raghunatha dasa Gosvami, the renowned
ascetic saint who was one of the most inti-
mate disciples of Sri Caitanya. He com-
menced work on the text while in his late
nineties and in failing health, as he vividly
describes in the text itself: “I have now be-
come too old and disturbed in invalidity.
While writing, my hands tremble. | cannot
remember anything, nor can | see or hear
properly. Still I write, and this is a great
wonder.” That he nevertheless completed,
under such debilitating conditions, the
greatest literary gem of medieval India is
surely one of the wonders of literary history.

The English translation and commentary is
the work of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhakti-
vedanta Swami Prabhupada, the world’s
most distinguished scholar and teacher of
Indian religious and philosophical thought.
He himself is a disciplic descendant of Sri
Caitanya, and his intimate familiarity with
the precepts of Caitanya Mahaprabhu emi-
nently qualifies him to present this impor-
tant classic to the English-speaking world.
The ease and clarity with which he ex-
pounds upon Sri Caitanya’s precepts lures
even a reader totally unfamiliar with Indian
religious tradition into a genuine under-
standing and appreciation of this profound
and monumental work.

The entire text, with commentary, pre-
sented in seventeen lavishly illustrated
volumes by the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust,
represents a contribution of major impor-
tance to the intellectual, cultural and
spiritual life of contemporary man.
