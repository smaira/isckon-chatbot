Introduction

“HARE KRSNA’ has become a household phrase in cities, towns and villages
throughout the world, fulfilling a prophecy made almost five hundred years ago by
Lord SrT Caitanya Mahaprabhu. From Los Angeles to London, from Bombay to
Buenos Aires, from Pittsburgh and Melbourne to Paris and even Moscow, people of
all ages, colors, creeds and faiths are feeling the bliss of the dynamic yoga system
called “Krsna consciousness.”

This Krsna consciousness movement began in full force some five hundred years
ago, when Lord SrT Caitanya 13173130170, an incarnation of Krsna (God), flooded
the subcontinent of India with the chanting of the mantra Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna,
Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. To reveal
the secret of what real love is, Krsna came to earth five hundred years ago in the
guise of His own devotee—as Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu. With His chief associates
—Nityananda, Advaita, Gadidhara and Srivisa—He taught how to develop love of
Godhead simply by chanting Hare Krsna and dancing in ecstasy.

-&(7 Caitanya-caritamyta, which was written by the great saint Krsnadisa Kavirija
Gosvami shortly after Lord Caitanya’s disappearance, vividly describes Lord
Caitanya’s blissful pastimes and probes deeply into His profound spiritual
philosophy.

The translations and purports, the explanations of the verses, are the work of His
Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, author of Bhagavad-gita As
It Is; The Nectar of Devotion; Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead (first
published in 1970 with the kind help of Mr. George Harrison); and numerous other
books about yoga and self-realization.

Although this is the third volume of Sri Caitanya~caritamrta, one need not have
read Volume Two to understand and appreciate this book. Srila Prabhupida remarks
that such a spiritual work is like sugar, for wherever you begin tasting it you will
surely enjoy its sweetness.

The Expansions
of Advaita Acarya and Gadadhara Pandita
Bhaktivinoda Thakura gives a summary of the Twelfth Chapter of Adi-/ild in his
Amrta-pravaha-bhasya. This Twelfth Chapter describes the followers of Advaita
Prabhu, among whom the followers of Acyutananda, the son of Advaita Acarya, are
understood to be the pure followers who received the cream of the philosophy Sri
Advaita Acarya enunciated. Other so-called descendants and followers of Advaita
Acaryaare not to be recognized. This chapter also includes narrations concerning the
son of Advaita Acarya named Gopala Misra and Advaita Acarya’s servant named
Kamalakanta Visvasa. In his early life Gopala fainted during the cleansing of the
Gundica mandira at Jagannatha Puri and thus became a recipient of the mercy of
Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu. The story of Kamalakanta Visvasa concerns his bor-
rowing three hundred rupees from Prataparudra Mahardja to clear the debts of
Advaita Acirya, for which Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu chastised him when He came
to know of it. Kamalakanta Visvasa was then purified by the request of Sri Advaita
Acidrya. After describing the descendants of Advaita Acarya, the chapter concludes
by describing the followers of Gadadhara Pandita Gosvami.

PURPORT
The words daivera karana indicate that by dint of providence, or by God’s will,
the followers of Advaita Acarya divided into two parties. Such disagreement among
the disciples of one dcdrya is also found among the members of the Gaudiya Matha.


--- Page 6 ---
Text 8] Expansions of Advaita Acarya 5
In the beginning, during the presence of Om Visnupada Paramahamsa Parivrajaka-
carya Astottara-sata Sri Srimad Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura Prabhupada, all
the disciples worked in agreement; but just after his disappearance, they disagreed.
One party strictly followed the instructions of Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura,
but another group created their own concoction about executing his desires.
Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura, at the time of his departure, requested all his
disciples to form a governing body and conduct missionary activities cooperatively.
He did not instruct a particular man to become the next dcarya. But just after his
passing away, his leading secretaries made plans, without authority, to occupy the
post of dcdrya, and they split in two factions over who the next acarya would be.
Consequently, both factions were asdra, or useless, because they had no authority,
having disobeyed the order of the spiritual master. Despite the spiritual master’s
order to form a governing body and execute the missionary activities of the Gaudiya
Matha, the two unauthorized factions began litigation that is still going on after
forty years with no decision.

Therefore, we do not belong to any faction. But because the two parties, busy
dividing the material assets of the Gaudiya Matha institution, stopped the preaching
work, we took up the mission of Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura and Bhaktivinoda
Thakura to preach the cult of Caitanya Mahaprabhu all over the world, under the
protection of all the predecessor dcaryas, and we find that our humble attempt has
been successful. We followed the principles especially explained by Srila Visvanatha
Cakravarti Thakura in his commentary on the Bhagavad-gita verse vyavasdyatmika
buddhir ekeha kuru-nandana. According to this instruction of Visvanatha Cakravarti
Thakura, it is the duty of a disciple to follow strictly the orders of his spiritual mas-
ter. The secret of success in advancement in spiritual life is the firm faith of the
disciple in the orders of his spiritual master. The Vedas confirm this:

yasya deve para bhaktir
yatha deve tatha gurau

tasyaite kathita hy arthah
prakasante mahatmanah

“To one who has staunch faith in the words of the spiritual master and the words
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead the secret of success in Vedic knowledge is
revealed.” The Krsna consciousness movement is being propagated according to this
principle, and therefore our preaching work is going on successfully, in spite of the
many impediments offered by antagonistic demons, because we are getting positive
help from our previous dcaryas. One must judge every action by its result. The mem-
bers of the self-appointed dcarya’s party who occupied the property of the Gaudiya
Matha are satisfied, but they could make no progress in preaching. Therefore by the
result of their actions one should know that they are asara, or useless, whereas the
success of the ISKCON party, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness,
which strictly follows guru and Gauranga, is increasing daily all over the world.
Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura wanted to print as many books as possible

and distribute them all over the world. We have tried our best in this connection,
and we are getting results beyond our expectations.

Some of the disciples strictly accepted the orders of the acarya, and others

PURPORT
This verse describes the beginning of a schism. When disciples do not stick to the
principle of accepting the order of their spiritual master, immediately there are two
opinions. Any opinion different from the opinion of the spiritual master is useless.
One cannot infiltrate materially concocted ideas into spiritual advancement. That is
deviation. There is no scope for adjusting spiritual advancement to material ideas.

PURPORT
This example given by Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami is very appropriate. In the case
of the Gaudiya Matha members, one can apply a similar process. There are many
disciples of Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura, but to judge who is actually his


--- Page 9 ---
8 ST Caitanya-caritamrta [Adi-fila, Ch. 12
disciple, to divide the useful from the useless, one must measure the activities of
such disciples in executing the will of the spiritual master. Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati
Thakura tried his best to spread the cult of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu to countries
outside India. When he was present he patronized the disciples to go outside India
to preach the cult of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, but they were unsuccessful because
within their minds they were not actually serious about preaching His cult in foreign
countries; they simply wanted to take credit for having gone to foreign lands and
utilize this recognition in India by advertising themselves as repatriated preachers.
Many svarnis have adopted this hypocritical means of preaching for the last eighty
years or more, but no one could preach the real cult of Krsna consciousness all over
the world. They merely came back to India falsely advertising that they had con-
verted all the foreigners to the ideas of Vedanta or Krsna consciousness, and then
they collected funds in India and lived satisfied lives of material comfort. As one
fans paddy to separate the real paddy from useless straw, by accepting the
criterion recommended by Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami one can very easily under-
stand who is a genuine world-preacher and who is useless.

TRANSLATION

When Advaita Acarya heard this statement from His five-year-old son

Acyutananda, He felt great satisfaction because of his conclusive judgement.
PURPORT

Commenting on verses 13 through 17, Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura gives
an extensive description of the descendants of Advaita Acarya. The Caitanya-
bhagavata, Antya-khanda, Chapter Nine, states that Acyutananda was the eldest son
of Advaita Acarya. The Sanskrit book Advaita-carita states, ‘Advaita Acarya Prabhu
had three sons named Acyuta, Krsna Misra and Gopala dasa, all born of the womb
of His wife 571546५1, who were devotees of Lord Caitanya. Advaita Acarya also had
three more sons, whose names were Balarama, SvarGipa and | 2९24152. Thus there
were six sons of Advaita Acarya.” Among the six sons, three were strict followers of
Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and of these three, Acyutananda was the eldest.

Advaita Prabhu married in the beginning of the Fifteenth Century $akdbda. When
Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu wanted to visit the village of Ramakeli while going from
Jagannatha Puri to Vyndavana during the $akdbda years 1433 and 1434, Acyutananda
was only five years old. The Caitanya-bhagavata, Antya-khanda, Fourth Chapter,
describes Acyutananda at that time as pafica-varsa vayasa madhura digambara, "01119
five years old and standing naked.” Therefore it is to be concluded that Acyutananda
was born sometime in the year 1428. Before the birth of Acyutananda, Advaita
Prabhu’s wife, Sitadevi, came to see Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu at His birth. Thus
it is not impossible that she had the other three sons by Advaita within the twenty-
one years between 1407 and 1428 sakdbda. In an unauthorized book of the name
Sitadvaita-carita published in Bengali in the unauthorized newspaper Nityananda-
dayini in 1792 $akabda, it is mentioned that Acyutananda was a class friend of Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu. According to Caitanya-bhagavata, this statement is not at all
valid. When Caitanya Mahaprabhu accepted the renounced order of sannyadsa, He
came to the house of Advaita Prabhu at Santipura in the year 1431 $akabda. At that
time, as stated in Caitanya-bhagavata, Antya-khanda, Chapter One, Acyutananda
was only three years old. The Caitanya-bhagavata further states that the naked child,
the son of Advaita Prabhu, immediately came and fell down at the lotus feet of Lord
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. The Lord immediately took him on His lap, although he
was not very clean, having dust all over his body. Lord Caitanya said, “My dear
Acyuta, Advaita Acarya is My father, and thus we are brothers.”

Before SriCaitanya Mahaprabhu exhibited His spiritual forms during His residence
at Navadvipa, He asked Sri Rama Pandita, Srinivasa Acirya’s brother, to go to


--- Page 12 ---
Text 17] Expansions of Advaita Acarya 11
Santipura and bring back Advaita Acarya. Acyutananda joined his father at that
time. It is said, advaitera tanaya ‘acyutananda’ nama/ parama-bataka, seho kande
avirama. Acyutananda also joined in crying in transcendental bliss. Again, when
Lord Caitanya beat Advaita Acarya for explaining Srimad-Bhagavatam from an im-
personalist viewpoint opposed to the principles of bhakti-yoga, Acyutananda was
also present. Therefore all these incidents must have occurred only two or three
years before Lord Caitanya accepted the sannydsa order. In the Caitanya-bhagavata,
Antya-khanda, Chapter Nineteen, it is stated that Acyutananda, the son of Advaita
Acarya, offered his obeisances to the Lord. Therefore it should be concluded that
from the very beginning of his life Acyutananda was a great devotee of Lord
Caitanya Mahaprabhu.

There is no information that Acyutananda ever married, but he is described as the
biggest branch of the Advaita Acarya family. From a book named $dkha-nirpayamyta
it is understood that Acyutananda was a disciple of Gadadhara and that he took
shelter of Lord Caitanya in Jagannatha Puri and engaged in devotional service. The
Caitanya-caritamrta, 40143, Chapter Ten, states that Acyutananda, the son of
Advaita Acarya, lived in )agannatha Puri, taking shelter of Lord Caitanya
Mahaprabhu. Gadadhara Pandita, in the last years of his life, also lived with Lord
Caitanya Mahaprabhu at Jagannatha Puri. There is no doubt, therefore, that
Acyutananda was a disciple of Pandita Gadadhara. In the accounts of Lord Caitanya
Mahaprabhu’s dancing in front of the car during the Rathayatra festival,
Acyutananda’s name is to be found many times. It is stated that in the party
of Advaita Acarya from Santipura, Acyutananda was dancing and others were
singing. At that time the boy was only six years old. The Gaura-ganoddesa-dipika
compiled by SriKavi-karnapiira has described Acyutananda as a disciple of Gadadhara
Pandita and a great and dear devotee of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu. According to
the opinion of some, he was an incarnation of Karttikeya, the son of Lord Siva, and
according to others he was formerly the gopi named Acyuta. The Gaura-gapoddesa-
dipika has supported both these opinions. Another book, Narottama-vildsa, com-
piled by Sri Narahari dasa, mentions Acyutananda’s presence during the festival at
Khetari. According to Sri Narahari dasa, during the last days of his life Acyutananda
stayed in his house at Santipura, but during the presence of Lord Caitanya
Mahaprabhu he lived at Jagannatha Puri with Gadadhara Pandita.

Of the six sons of Advaita Acirya, three, Acyutananda, Krsna Misra and Gopala
dasa, lived faithfully in the service of Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Sincé Acyutananda did
not accept a wife, he had no issue. The second son of Advaita Acarya, Krsna Misra,
had two sons, Raghunatha Cakravarti and Dolagovinda. The descendants of
Raghunatha still live in Santipura in the nieghborhoods of Madana-gopala-pada,
Ganakara, Mrjapura and Kumarakhali. Dolagovinda had three sons, namely, (211५,
Kandarpa and Gopinatha. The descendants of Kandarpa live in Maldah in the village
Jikabadi. Gopinatha had three sons, Sri Vallabha, Pranavallabha and Kesava. The
descendants of Sri Vallabha live in the villages known as Masiyadara (Mahisadera),
Damukadiya and Candipura. There is a genealogical table for the family of Sri
Vallabha beginning from his eldest son, Gariga-narayana. The descendants of Sri
Vallabha’s youngest son, Ramagopala, still live in Damukadiya, Candipura, Solamari,
and so on. The descendants of Pranavallabha and Kesava live in Uthali. The son of


--- Page 13 ---
12 Sr Caitanya-caritimrta [Adi-lila, Ch. 12
Prapavallabha was Ratnesvara, and his son was Krsnarama, whose youngest son was
Laksmi-narayana. His son was Navakisora, and Navakisora’s second son was
Ramamohana, whose eldest son was Jagabandhu and whose third son, Viracandra,
accepted the sannydsa order and established a Deity of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu
in Katwa. These two sons of Ramamohana were known as Bada Prabhu and Chota
Prabhu, and they inaugurated the circumambulation of Navadvipa-dhama. One may

TRANSLATION
The other sons of Advaita Acarya were Sri Balarama, Svaripa and | agadisa.
PURPORT

The Sanskrit book Advaita-carita states that Balarama, Svariipa and Jagadisa were
the fourth, fifth and sixth sons of Advaita Acarya. Therefore Sri Advaita Acarya
had six sons. Balarama, Svariipa and )agadisa, being srmdrtas or Mayavadis, were re-
jected by Vaisnava society. Sometimes Mayavadis pose themselves as Vaisnavas, or
worshipers of Lord Visnu, but actually they do not believe in Lord Visnu as the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, for they consider demigods like Lord Siva, Durga,
the sun-god and Ganesa equal to Him. They are generally known as pancopdsaka-
smadrtas, and one should not count them among the Vaisnavas.

Balarama had three wives and nine sons. The youngest son of his first wife was
known 25 Madhuslidana Gosvami. He took the title Bhattacarya and accepted the
path of the smarta or Mayavada philosophy. Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura
notes that the son of Gosvami Bhattacarya, Sri Radharamana Gosvami Bhattacarya,
refused the title gosvamr because it is generally meant for sannydsis, those who have
taken the renounced order of life. One who is still in family life should not misuse
the title gosvami. Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura did not recognize the
caste gosvamis because they were not in the line of the six Gosvamis in the renounced
order who were direct disciples of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu—namely, Srila Rupa
Gosvami, Srila Sanatana Gosvami, Srila Bhatta Raghunatha Gosvami, 911 Gopala
Bhatta Gosvami, Sri Jiva Gosvami and Srila Raghunatha dasa Gosvami. Srila
Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura said that the grhasthasrama, or the status of
family life, is a sort of concession for sense gratification. Therefore a grhastha should
not falsely adopt the title gosvami. The ISKCON movement has never conferred the


--- Page 18 ---
Text 29] Expansions of Advaita Acarya 17
title gosvami upon a householder. Although all the sannydsis we have initiated in
ISKCON are young, we have awarded them the titles of the renounced order of life,
svami and gosvami, because they have completely dedicated their lives to preach the
cult of 911 Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura mentions
that not only do the householder caste gosvamis disrespect the title gosvami, but
also, following the principles of the smarta Raghunandana, they exhibitgreat foolish-
ness by burning a straw image of Advaita Acarya in a sraddha ceremony, thus
acting 25 Raksasas and disrespecting the cause of Hari-bhakti-vildsa, which is the guide
for Vaisnavas. Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura says that sometimes these
smadrta caste gosvamis write books on Vaisnava philosophy or commentaries on the
original scriptures, but a pure devotee should cautiously avoid reading them.

TRANSLATION

“But he has made the incarnation of Godhead a poverty-stricken beggar. Therefore

I shall punish him for his correction.”
PURPORT

To describe a man as an incarnation of God, or Narayana, and at the same time
present him as poverty-stricken is contradictory, and it is the greatest offense. The
Mayavadi philosophers, engaged in the missionary work of spoiling the Vedic culture
by preaching that everyone is God, describe a poverty-stricken man as daridra-
nardyapa, or ‘‘poor Narayana.” Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu never accepted such
foolish and unauthorized ideas. He strictly warned, mayavadi-bhasya sunile haya
sarva-nasa: “Anyone who follows the principles of Mayavada philosophy is certainly
doomed.” Such a fool needs to be reformed by punishment.

Although it is contradictory to say that the Supreme Personality of Godhead or
His incarnation is poverty-stricken, we find in the revealed scriptures that when the
Lord incarnated as Vamana, He begged some land from Maharaja Bali. Everyone
knows, however, that Vamanadeva was not at all poverty-stricken. His begging from


--- Page 22 ---
Text 37] Expansions of Advaita Acarya 21
Maharaja Bali was a device to favor him. When Maharaja Bali actually gave the land,
Vamanadeva exhibited His all-powerful position by covering the three worlds with
three steps. One should not accept the so-called daridra-nardyanas as incarnations
because they are completely unable to show the opulence of the genuine incarna-
tions of God.

PURPORT
The bauliyas, or baulas, are one of thirteen unauthorized sects that pass as fol-
lowers of Caitanya Mahaprabhu. The Lord ordered Govinda, His personal assistant,
not to allow Kamalakanta Visvasa to come in His presence because he had become
a bauliya. Thus although the baula-sampradaya, aula-sampradaya and sahajiya-
sampraddya, as well as the smartas, jata-gosanis, atibadis, cudadharis and gauranga-
ndgaris, claim to belong to the disciplic succession of Caitanya Mahaprabhu, the
Lord actually rejected them.

TRANSLATION
When Kamalakanta Visvasa heard about this punishment by Sri Caitanya
13113013010, he was very much unhappy, but when Advaita Prabhu heard about it,
He was greatly pleased.
PURPORT
In Bhagavad-gita the Lord says, samo ‘hari sarva-bhitesu na me dvesyo sti na
priyah: ^^ envy no one, nor am | partial to anyone. | am equal to all.” (Bg. 9.29)
The Supreme Personality of Godhead being equal to everyone, no one can be His
enemy, nor can anyone be His friend. Since everyone is a part or son of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, the Lord cannot partially regard someone as a friend and
someone as an enemy. Thus when Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu punished Kamalakanta
Visvasa by no longer allowing him to come in His presence, although the punishment
was actually very hard on him, Sri Advaita Prabhu, understanding the inner meaning
of such punishment, was happy because He appreciated that the Lord had actually
favored Kamalakanta Visvasa. Therefore he was not at all unhappy. Devotees should
always be happy with all the dealings of their master, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. A devotee may be put into difficulty or opulence, but he should accept
both as gifts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and jubilantly engage in the
service of the Lord in all circumstances.

There is a book of the name Yoga-vasistha that Mayavadis greatly favor because it
is full of impersonal misunderstandings regarding the Supreme Personality of God-
head, with no touch of Vaisnavism. Factually, all Vaisnavas should avoid such a book,
but Advaita Acarya Prabhu, wanting punishment from the Lord, began to support
the impersonal statements of the Yoga-vasistha. Thus Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu
became extremely angry at Him and seemingly treated Him disrespectfully.

“When chastised by Lord Caitanya, | was very happy to receive a punishment
similar to that awarded Sri Mukunda.
PURPORT
Sri Mukunda, a great friend and associate of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu, used to
visit many places where people were against the Vaisnava cult. When Lord Caitanya
Mahaprabhu came to know of this, He punished Mukunda, forbidding him to see
Him again. Although Caitanya Mahaprabhu was soft like a flower, He was also strict
like a thunderbolt, and everyone was afraid to allow Mukunda to come again into
the presence of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Mukunda, therefore, being very sorry,
asked his other friends whether he would one day be allowed to see Lord Caitanya
Mahaprabhu. When the devotees brought this inquiry to Lord Caitanya, the Lord re-
plied, “Mukunda will get permission to see Me after many millions of years.” When
they gave this information to Mukunda, he danced with jubilation, and when Lord
Caitanya Mahaprabhu heard that Mukunda was so patiently waiting to meet Him
after millions of years, He immediately asked him to return. There is a statement
about this punishment of Mukunda in the Caitanya-bhagavata, Madhya-lila, Tenth
Chapter.

Mother Sacidevi was similarly punished, as mentioned in the Caitanya-bhagavata,
Madhya-lila, Chapter Twenty-two. Mother Sacidevi, apparently showing her feminine
nature, accused Advaita Prabhu of encouraging her son to become a sannyasi.
Caitanya Mahaprabhu, taking this accusation as an offense, asked Sacidevi to touch
the lotus feet of Advaita Acarya to mitigate the offense she had supposedly com-
mitted.

TRANSLATION
“The favor You have shown Kamalakanta is so great that even to Me You have
never shown such favor. What offense have | committed at Your lotus feet so as not
to be shown such favor?”
PURPORT
This is a reference to Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s former punishment of Advaita
Acarya. When Advaita Acarya Prabhu was reading Yoga-vasistha, Lord Caitanya
Mahaprabhu beat Him, but He never told Him not to come in His presence. But
Kamalakanta was punished with the order never to come in the [01015 presence.
Therefore Sri Advaita Acarya Prabhu wanted to impress upon Caitanya Mahaprabhu
that He had shown more favor to Kamalakanta Visvasa because He had prohibited


--- Page 28 ---
Text 48] Expansions of Advaita Acarya 27
Kamalakanta from seeing Him, whereas He had not done so to Advaita Acarya.
Therefore the favor shown Kamalakanta Visvasa was greater than that shown
Advaita Acarya.

TRANSLATION
Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu instructed Kamalakanta, “You are a bauliya, one who
does not know things as they are. Why do you act in this way? Why do you invade
the privacy of Advaita Acarya and damage His religious principles?
PURPORT
Kamalakanta Viévasa, out of his ignorance, asked the King of Jagannatha Puri,
Maharaja Prataparudra, to liquidate the three-hundred-rupee debt of Advaita Acarya,
but at the same time he established Advaita Acarya as an incarnation of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. This is contradictory. An incarnation of the Supreme
Godhead cannot be indebted to anyone in this material world. Caitanya
Mahaprabhu is never satisfied by such a contradiction, which is technically called
rasabhasa, or overlapping of one humor (rasa) with another. This is the same type
of idea as the contradiction that Narayana is poverty-stricken (daridra-narayana).

SYNONYMS
pratigraha—accepting of alms; kabhu—any time; nd—not; karibe—should do; rdja-
dhana—charity by kings; visayira—of men who are materialistic; anna—foodstuffs;
khaile—by eating; dusta—polluted; haya—becomes; mana—mind.
TRANSLATION
“Advaita Acarya, My spiritual master, should never accept charity from rich
men or kings because if a spiritual master accepts money or grains from such mate-
rialists his mind becomes polluted.
PURPORT
It is very risky to accept money or foodstuffs from materialistic persons, for such
acceptance pollutes the mind of the charity’s recipient. According to the Vedic
system, one should give charity to sannydsis and brahmanas because one who thus
gives charity becomes free from sinful activities. Formerly, therefore, brahmanas
would not accept charity from a person unless he were very pious. Lord Caitanya
Mahaprabhu gave this instruction for all spiritual masters. Materialistic persons
who are not inclined to give up their sinful activities like illicit sex, intoxication,
gambling and meat-eating sometimes want to become our disciples, but, unlike
professional spiritual masters who accept disciples regardless of their condition,
Vaisnavas do not accept such cheap disciples. One must at least agree to abide by
the rules and regulations for a disciple before a Vaisnavadcdrya can accept him. In
fact, a Vaisnava should not even accept charity or foodstuffs from persons who do
not follow the rules and regulations of the Vaisnava principles.

of Lord Krsna; smarana—remembrance; krspa-smrti—remembrance of Lord Krsna;

TRANSLATION
‘When one’s mind is polluted, it is very difficult to remember Krsna; and when
remembrance of Lord Krsna is hampered, one’s life is unproductive.


--- Page 31 ---
30 Sir Caitanya-caritamrta [Adi-lila, Ch. 12
PURPORT
A devotee should always be alert, keeping his mind in a sanguine state so that he
can always remember Lord Sri Krsna. The S$dstras state, smartavyah satatari visnuh:
in devotional life one should always remember Lord Visnu. Srila Sukadeva
Gosvam also advised Maharaja Pariksit, smartavyo nityasah. In the Second Canto,
First Chapter, of Srimad-Bhagavatam, Sukadeva Gosvami advised Pariksit Maharaja:
tasmad bharata sarvatmd bhagavan isvaro harih
Srotavyah Rirtitavyas ca smartavyas cecchatabhayam
“‘O descendant of King Bharata, one who desires to be free from all miseries must
hear, glorify and also remember the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the
Supersoul, the controller and the savior from all miseries.” (Bhag. 2.1.5) This is the
summary of all the activities of a Vaisnava, and the same instruction is repeated here
(krsna-smrti vinu haya nisphala jivana). Srila Ripa Gosvami states in Bhakti-
rasamrta-sindhu, avyartha-kRalatvam: A Vaispava must be very alert not to waste
even a second of his valuable lifetime. This is a symptom of a Vaisnava. But associa-
tion with pounds-and-shillings men, or visay7s, materialists who are simply interested
in sense gratification, pollutes one’s mind and hampers such continuous remem-
brance of Lord Krsna. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu therefore advised, asat-sariga-
tyaga—ei vaispava-acara: a Vaisnava should behave in such a way as to never asso-
siate with nondevotees or materialists (Cc. Madhya 22.87). One can avoid such as-
sociation simply by always remembering Krsna within his heart.

TRANSLATION
“Thus one becomes unpopular in the eyes of the people in general, for this
damages his religiosity and fame. A Vaispava, especially one who acts as a spiritual
master, must not act in such a way. One should always be conscious of this fact.”

Gosvami. In other words, when Raghunatha dasa Gosvami was a householder,
Yadunandana Acirya initiated him at home. Later Raghunatha dasa Gosvamt took
shelter of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu at Jagannatha Puri.

In his Anubhadsya Sri Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami Prabhupada says that
Bhagavata Acarya was formerly among the followers of Advaita Acarya but was later
counted among the followers of Gadadhara Pandita. The sixth verse of Sakha-
nirpayamrta, abook written by Yadunandana dasa, states that Bhagavata Acarya com-
piled a famous book of the name Prema-tarangini. According to the Gaura-ganoddesa-
dipika, verse 195, Bhagavata Acarya formerly lived in V(ndavana as Sveta-madjari.
Visnudasa Acarya was present during the Khetari-mahotsava. He went there with
Acyutananda, as stated in the Bhakti-ratnakara, Tenth Taranga. Ananta Acarya was
one of the eight principal gopis. His former name was Sudevi. Although he was

hereinbefore, the representatives of Advaita Acarya later divided into two groups—
the bona fide branches of the dcarya’s disciplic succession and the pretentious
branches of Advaita Acarya. Those who followed the principles of Caitanya
Mahaprabhu flourished, whereas the others, who are mentioned below in the sixty-
seventh verse, dried up.

TRANSLATION
A person without Krsna consciousness is no better than dry wood or a dead body.
He is understood to be dead while living, and after death he is punishable by
Yamaraja.
PURPORT
In the Srimad-Bhdgavatam, Sixth Canto, Third Chapter, twenty-ninth verse,
Yamaraja, the superintendent of death, tells his assistants what class of men they
should bring before him. There he states, ““A person whose tongue never describes
the qualities and holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose heart
never throbs as he remembers Krsna and His lotus feet, and whose head never bows
in obeisances to the Supreme Lord, must be brought before me for punishment.”
In other words, nondevotees are brought before Yamaraja for punishment, and
thus material nature awards them various types of bodies. After death, which
is dehdntara, a change of body, nondevotees are brought before Yamaraja for
justice. By the judgment of Yamaraja, material nature gives them bodies suitable
for the resultant actions of their past activities. This is the process of dehantara, or
transmigration of the self from one body to another. Krsna conscious devotees,
however, are not subject to be judged by Yamaraja. For devotees there is an open
road, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita. After giving up the body (tyaktva deham), a
devotee never again has to accept another material body, for in a spiritual body he
goes back home, back to Godhead. The punishments of Yamaraja are meant for
persons who are not Krsna conscious.

The descendants of Advaita Acarya who accepted the path of Sri Acyutananda

PURPORT
In this connection, Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura, in his Amyrta-pravaha-bhasya,
gives this short note: ‘Sri Advaita Acarya is one of the important trunks of the
bhakti-kalpataru, or desire tree of devotional service. Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu,
as a gardener, poured water on the root of the bhakti tree and thus nourished all its
trunks and branches. But nevertheless, under the spell of maya, the most unfortu-
nate condition of a living entity, some of the branches, not accepting the gardener
who poured water on them, considered the trunk the only cause of the great bhakti-


--- Page 42 ---
Text 73] Expansions of Advaita Acarya 41
kalpataru. In other words, the branches or descendants of Advaita Acarya who con-
sidered Advaita Acarya the original cause of the devotional creeper, and who thus
neglected or disobeyed the instructions of Sr Caitanya Mahaprabhu, deprived them-
selves of the effect of being watered and thus dried up and died. It is further to be
understood that not only the misguided descendants of Advaita Acarya but anyone
who has no connection with Caitanya Mahaprabhu—even if he is independently a
great sannyadsi, learned scholar or ascetic—is like a dead branch of a tree.”

This analysis by Sri Bhaktivinoda Thakura, supporting the statements of Sri
Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami, depicts the position of the present so-called Hindu re-
ligion, which, being predominantly conducted by the Mayavada philosophy, has be-
come a hodgepodge institution of various concocted ideas. Mayavadis greatly fear
the Krsna consciousness movement and accuse it of spoiling the Hindu religion be-
cause it accepts people from all parts of the world and all religious sects and
scientifically engages them in the daiva-varpasrama-dharma. As we have explained
several times, however, we find no such word as “Hindu’’ in the Vedic literature.
The word most probably came from Afghanistan, a predominantly Mohammedan
country, and originally referred to a pass in Afghanistan known as Hindukush that
is still a part of a trade route between India and various Mohammedan countries.

The actual Vedic system of religion is called varpasrama-dharma, as confirmed in
the Vispu Purdpa:

varpdsramdcdravata purusena parah puman
visnur aradhyate panthd nanyat tat-tosa-karanam
(Visnu Purapa, 3.8.9)

The Vedic literature recommends that a human being follow the principles of
varpasrama-dharma. Accepting the process of varpdsrama-dharma will make a
person's life successful because this will connect him with the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, who is the goal of human life. Therefore the Krsna consciousness
movement is meant for all of humanity. Although human society has different
sections or subdivisions, all human beings belong to one species, and therefore we
accept that they all have the ability to understand their constitutional position in
connection with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vispu. Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu confirms, jivera ‘svarapa’ haya—krspera nitya-dasa: ‘‘Every living
entity is an eternal part, an eternal servant, of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.”
Every living entity who attains the human form of life can understand the impor-
tance of his position and thus become eligible to become a devotee of Lord Krsna.
We take it for granted, therefore, that all humanity should be educated in Krsna
consciousness. Indeed, in all parts of the world, in every country where we preach
the sankirtana movement, we find that people very easily accept the Hare Krsna
mahd-mantra without hesitation. The visible effect of this chanting is that the
members of the Hare Krsna movement, regardless of their backgrounds, all give up
the four principles of sinful life and come to an elevated standard of devotion.

Although posing as great scholars, ascetics, householders and svamis, the so-called
followers of the Hindu religion are all useless, dried-up branches of the Vedic reli-


--- Page 43 ---

gion. They are impotent; they cannot do anything to spread the Vedic culture for
the benefit of human society. The essence of the Vedic culture is the message of Sri’
Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Lord Caitanya instructed:
yare dekha, tare kaha ‘krsna’ upadesa
amadra ajnaya guru hana tara’ ei desa
(Cc. Madhya 7.128)
One should simply instruct everyone he meets regarding the principles of krspa-
kathd, as expressed in Bhagavad-gita As It Is and Srimad-Bhagavatam. One who has
no interest in krspa-katha or the cult of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is like dry, useless
wood with no living force. The ISKCON branch, being directly watered by Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu, is becoming undoubtedly successful, whereas the discon-
nected branches of the so-called Hindu religion that are envious of ISKCON are
drying up and dying.

nephew of Sri Nilambara Cakravarti, $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s grandfather. In
Bengal a maternal uncle is called mama, and in East Bengal and Orissa, mamu.Thus
Jagannatha Cakravarti was known as Mama or Mamu Thakura. Mamu Thakura’s
residence was in the district of Faridpur in the village known as Magadoba. After
the demise of Sri Gadadhara Pandita, Mamu Thakura became the priest in charge of
the temple known as Tota-gopinatha in Jagannatha Puri. According to the opinion
of some Vaisnavas, Mamu Thakura was formerly known 25 Sri Rupa-manjari. The
followers of Mamu Thakura were Raghunatha Gosvami, Ramacandra,
Radhavallabha, Krsnajivana, Syamasundara, Santamani, Harinatha, Navinacandra,

Chapter 13
The Advent
= . =
of Lord $ri Caitanya Mahiprabhu

This Thirteenth Chapter of $/7 Caitanya-caritdmrta describes Lord Caitanya
Mah3prabhu’s appearance. The entire Adi-fi/a section describes Lord Caitanya
Mahaprabhu’s household life, and similarly the Antya-/ilé describes His life in the
sannyasa order. Within the Antya4/1a, the first six years of His sannydsa life are
called Madhya-fi/a. During this time, Caitanya Mahaprabhu toured southern india,
went to Vrndavana, returned from Vrndavana and preached the sahkirtana
movement.

A learned brdhmara named Upendra Misra who resided in the district of Srihatta
was the father of )Jagannatha Misra, who came to Navadvipa to study under the
direction of Nilambara Cakravarti and then settled there after marrying Nilambara
Cakravarti’sdaughter, Sacidevi. Sri SacidevT gave birth to eight children, all daughters,
who died one after another immediately after birth. After her ninth pregnancy, she
gave birth to a son, who was named Visvarapa. Then, in 1407 Saka Era on the full-
moon evening of the month of Phalguna, during the constellation of sirhhalagna,
Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu appeared as the son of SriSacidevi and Jagannatha Misra.
After hearing of the birth of Caitanya Mahaprabhu, learned scholars and brghmanas,
bringing many gifts, came to see the newly born baby. Nflambara Cakravarti, who
was a great astrologer, immediately prepared a horoscope, and by astrological
calculation he saw that the child was a great personality. This chapter describes the
symptoms of this great personality.

TRANSLATION
| wish the grace of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu, by whose mercy even one who is
fallen can describe the pastimes of the Lord.
PURPORT
To describe Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu or Lord Sri Krsna, one needs supernatural
power, which is the grace and mercy of the Lord. Without this grace and mercy, one
cannot compose transcendental literature. By dint of the grace of the Lord, how-
ever, even one who is unfit for a literary career can describe wonderful transcendental
topics. Description of Krspa is possible for one who is empowered. Krsna-sakti
vind nahe tara pravartana (Cc. Antya 7.11). Unless endowed with the mercy of the
Lord, one cannot preach of the Lord's name, fame, quality, form, entourage and so
on. It should be concluded, therefore, that the description of Caitanya-caritémrta
by Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami manifests specific mercy bestowed upon the author,
although he thought of himself as the most fallen. We should not consider him
fallen because he describes himself as such. Rather, anyone who is able to compose
such transcendental literature is our esteemed master,

--- Page 59 ---
58 5/7 Caitanya-caritimrta [Adi-lila, Ch. 13
PURPORT
In this verse we find the moon described as candragana, which is plural in
number. This indicates that there are many moons. In 8hagavad-gita the Lord says,
naksatrapam aharh Sasi: ‘Among the stars, | am the moon.” (Bg. 10.21) All the
stars are like the moon. Western astranomers consider the stars to be suns, but
Vedic astronomers, following the Vedic scriptures, consider them moons. The sun
has the ability to shine powerfully, and the moons reflect the sunshine and there-
fore look brilliant. In Caitanya-caritamrta Krsna is described to be like the sun.
The supreme powerful is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Sri Krsna, or Lord
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and His devotees are also bright and illuminating because
they reflect the supreme sun. The Caitanya-caritamrta states:
krsna—sarya-sama; maya haya andhakara
yahar krsna, taharn néhi maydra adhikara
“Krsna is bright like the sun. As soon as the sun appears, there is no question of
darkness or nescience.” {Cc. Madhya 22.31) Similarly, this verse also describes that
by the illumination of ali the moons, brightened by the reflection of the Krsna sun,
or by the grace of all the devotees of Caitanya Mahaprabhu, the entire world will
be illuminated, despite the darkness of Kaliyuga. Only the devotees of Lord Caitanya
Mahaprabhu can dissipate the darkness of Kali-yuga, the ignorance of the popula-
tion of this age. No one else can do so. We therefore wish that all the devotees of
the Krsna consciousness movement may reflect the supreme sun and thus dissipate
the darkness of the entire world.

TRANSLATION
„ When teaching a course in grammar [vyakarana] and explaining it with notes,
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu taught His disciples about the glories of Lord Krsna. All
explanations culminated in Krsna, and His disciples would understand them very
easily. Thus His influence was wonderful.
PURPORT

51 Jiva Gosvam? compiled a grammar in two pasts named Laghu-hari-némampta-
vyakarana and Brhad-dhari-namamyta-vyakarana. | someone studies these two texts
in vyakarana, or grammar, he learns the grammatical rules of the Sanskrit language
and simultaneously learns how to become a great devotee of Lord Krsna.

In the Caitanya-bhagavata, First Chapter, there is a statement about the method
by which Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu taught grammar. Lord Caitanya
Mahaprabhu explained the codes of grammar to be eternal, like the holy name of
Krsna. As stated in Bhagavad.gita (15.15), vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyab. The
purport of all revealed scriptures is understanding of Krsna. Therefore if a person
explains anything that is not Krsna, he simply wastes his time laboring hard without
fulfilling the aim of his life. If one simply becomes a teacher or professor of educa-
tion but does not understand Krsna, it is to be understood that he is among the
lowest of mankind, as stated in Bhagavad.gita (naradhamah mdyaydpahrta-jfianah).
If one does not know the essence of all revealed scriptures but stili becomes a
teacher, his teaching is like the disturbing braying of an ass.

Text 32] The Advent of Lord Caitanya 69
TRANSLATION
When Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu was a student, He asked whomever He met to
chant the Hare Krsna maha-mantra. in this way He inundated the whole town of
Navadvipa with the chanting of Hare Krsna.
PURPORT
The present Navadvipa-dhama is but a part of the whole of Navadvipa. Navadvipa
means “nine islands.” These nine islands, which occupy an area of land estimated at
thirty-two square miles, are surrounded by different branches of the Ganges. In all
nine of those islands of the Navadvipa area there are different places for cultivating
devotional service. It is stated in the $rimad-Bhagavatam that there are nava-vidha
bhakti, nine different activities of devotional service: Sravanarit kirtanari vispoh
smaranarh pada-sevanam arcanarh vandanarh dasyari sakhyam atma-nivedanam.
There are different islands in the Navadvipa area for cultivation of these nine
varieties of devotional service. They are as follows: (1) Antardvipa, (2) Simanta-
dvipa, (3) Godrumadvipa, (4) Madhyadvipa, (5) Koladvipa, (6) Rtudvipa,
(7) Jahnudvipa, (8) Modadruma-dvipa and (9) Rudradvipa. According to the settle-
ment map, our ISKCON Navadvipa center is situated on the Rudradvipa island.
Below Rudradvipa, in Antardvipa, is Mayapur. There Sri Jagannatha Misra,
the father of Caitanya Mahaprabhu, used to reside. In all these different islands,
Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu, as a young man, used to lead His saskirtana party. He
thus inundated the entire area with the waves of {०५८ of Krsna.

TRANSLATION
The sankirtana movement went on from one part of the town to another, as the
Lord wandered everywhere performing kirtana. In this way He inundated the whole
world by distributing love of Godhead.
PURPORT
One may raise the question how all three worids became inundated with love of
Krsna since Caitanya Mahaprabhu performed kirtana only in the Navadvipa area.
The answer is that Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is Krsna Himself. The entire cos-
mic manifestation results from the Lord's first setting it in motion. Similarly, since
the sarfkirtana movement was first set in motion five hundred years ago by Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s desire that it spread all over the universe, the Krsna con-
sciousness movement, in continuity of that same motion, is now spreading all over
the world, and in this way it will gradually spread all over the universe. With the
spread of the Krsna consciousness movement, everyone will merge in an ocean of
love of Krsna.

TRANSLATION
For the remaining twelve years He stayed in Jagannatha Puri, He taught everyone
how to taste the transcendental mellow ecstasy of love of Krsna by tasting it Him-
self.
PURPORT
A person who is advanced in Krspa consciousness always feels separation from
Krsna because such a feeling of separation excels the feeling of meeting Krsna. Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu, in His last twelve years of existence within this world at
Jagannatha Puri, taught the people of the world how, with a feeling of separation,
one can develop His dormant love of Krsna. Such feelings of separation or meeting
with Krsna are different stages of love of Godhead. These feelings develop in time
when a person seriously engages in devotional service. The highest stage is called
prerna-bhakti, but this stage is attained by executing sadhana-bhakti. One should
not try to elevate himself artificially to the stage of prerma-bhakti without seriously
following the regulative principles of s@dhana-bhakti. Prerna-bhakti is the stage of
relishing, whereas sadhana-bhakti is the stage of improving in devotional service.
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu taught this cult of devotional service in full detail by
practical application in His own life. It is said, therefore, dpani 00071 bhakti
Sikhaimu sabgre. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is Krsna Himself, and in the role of a
krspa-bhakta, a devotee of Krsna, He instructed the entire world how one can
execute devotional service and thus go back home, back to Godhead, in due course
of time,

As Srimati Radharani talked inconsistently when She met Uddhava, so also Sif

of Srimati Radharani.
PURPORT
In this connection one should refer to Srimati Radharani’s soliloquy after meeting
Uddhava in Vrndavana. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu presented a similar picture of such
ecstatic imaginary talking. Full of jealousy and madness symptomizing neglect of
Krsna, Srimati Radharani, criticizing a bumblebee, tatked just like a madwoman.
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, in the last days of His pastimes, exhibited all the symp-
toms of such ecstasy. [7 this connection one should refer to the Fourth Chapter of
AdHila, verses 107 and 108.

TRANSLATION
The Lord used to read the books of Vidyapati, Jayadeva and Candidasa, relishing
their songs with His confidential associates like Sri Ramananda Raya and Svariipa
Damodara Gosvami.
PURPORT
Vidyapati was a famous composer of songs about the pastimes of Radha-Krsna.
He was an inhabitant of Mithila, born in a brahmapa family. It is calculated that he
composed his songs during the reign of King Sivasimha and Queen Lachimadevi in
the beginning of the Fourteenth Century of the Saka Era, almost one hundred years
before the appearance of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu. The twelfth generation of
Vidyapati's descendants is still living. Vidyapati's songs about the pastimes of Lord
Krsnaexpressintense feelings of separation from Krsna,and Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu
relished all those songs in His ecstasy of separation from Krsna.
layadeva was born during the reign of Maharaja Laksmana Sena of Bengal in the
Eleventh or Twelfth Century of the Saka Era. His father was Bhojadeva, and his
mother was Vamadevi. For many years he lived in Navadvipa, then the capital of
Bengal. His birthplace was in the Birbhum district in the village Kendubilva. In the
opinion of some authorities, however, he was born in Orissa, and still others say that
he was born in Southern India. He passed the last days of his life in Jagannatha Puri.
One of his famous books is Gita-govinda, which is full of transcendental mellow
feelings of separation from Krsna. The 05 felt separation from Krsna before the
rasa dance, as mentioned in the Srimad-Bhdgavatam, and the Gita-govinda expresses
such feelings. There are many commentaries on the Gitagovinda by many Vaisnavas.
Candidasa was born in the village of Nannura, which is also in the Birbhum
district of Bengal. He was born of 2 brahmana family, and it is said that he also took
birth in the beginning of the Fourteenth Century,Sakabda Era. It has been suggested
that Candidasa and Vidyapati were great friends because the writings of both express
the transcendental feelings of separation profusely. The feelings of ecstasy described
by Candidasa and Vidyapati were actually exhibited by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.
He relished all those feelings in the role of Sri Radharani, and His appropriate as-

sociates for this purpose were Sri Rimananda Raya and Sei Svaripa Damodara
Gosvami. These intimate associates of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu helped the Lord
very much in the pastimes in which He felt like Radharani.

७ Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thikura comments in this connection that such
feelings of separation as Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu enjoyed from the books of
Vidyapati, Candidasa and }ayadeva are especially reserved for persons like Sri
Ramananda Raya and Svaripa Damodara, who were paramaharnsas, men of the
topmost perfection, because of their advanced spiritual consciousness. Such topics
are not to be discussed by ordinary persons imitating the activities of Lord Caitanya
Mahaprabhu. For critical students of mundane poetry and literary men without God
consciousness who are after bodily sense gratification, there is no need to read such
a high standard of transcendental literature. Persons who are after sense gratification
should not try to imitate rgganuga devotional service. In their songs, Candidasa,
Vidyapati and Jayadeva have described the transcendental activities of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Mundane reviewers of the songs of Vidyapati, Jayadeva
and Candidasa simply help people in general become debauchees, and this leads only
to social scandals and atheism in the world. One should not misunderstand the
pastimes of Radha and Krsna to be the activities of a mundane young boy and girl.
The mundane sexual activities of young boys and girls are most abominable. There-
fore, those who are in bodily consciousness and who desire sense gratification are
forbidden to indulge in discussions of the transcendental pastimes of Sri Radha and
Krsna.

PURPORT

In the beginning of Caitanya-caritamrta it is said that Lord Caitanya appeared to
taste the feelings Radharani felt upon seeing Krsna. Krsna Himself could not under-
stand the ecstatic feelings of Radharani toward Him, and therefore He desired to ac-
cept the role of Radharani and thereby taste these feelings. Lord Caitanya is Krsna

Text 45] The Advent of Lord Caitanya 77
with the feelings of Radharanf; in other words, He is a combination of Radha and
Krsna. It is therefore said, Sri-krspa-caitanya radha-krspa nahe anya. By worshiping
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu atone, one can relish the loving affairs of Radha and Krsna
together. One should therefore try to understand Radha-Krsna not directly but
through Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and through His devotees. Srita Narottama dasa
Thakura therefore says, ripa-raghunatha-pade haibe akuti, kabe hama bujhaba se
yugala-piriti: “When shall | develop a mentality of service toward Sri Rupa Gosvami,
Sanatana Gosvami, Raghunidtha dasa Gosvami and the other devotees of Lord
Caitanya and thus become eligible to understand the pastimes of Sri Radha and
Krsna?"

Bangladesh. His nephew was Jagannatha Cakravarti, also known 25 Mamu Thakura,
who became a disciple of Pandita Gosvami and stayed at Jagannitha Puri as the
priest of Tota-gopinatha. Nitambara Cakravarti lived at Navadvipa in the neighbor-
hood of Belapukuriya. This fact is mentioned in the book Prema-vildsa. Because he
fived near the house of the Kazi, the Kazi was also considered one of the maternal
uncles of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu. The Kazi used to address Nitambara 13310]
as kaka, or “uncle.” One cannot separate the residence of the Kazi from Vamana-
pukura because the tomb of the Kazi is still existing there. Formerly the place was
known as Belapukuriya, and now it is called Vamanapukura. This has been ascer-
tained by archeological evidence.

TRANSLATION

In 1২390173063, the part of Bengal where the Ganges is not visible, Nityananda

Prabhu, Gangadasa Pandita, Murari Gupta and Mukunda took birth.
PURPORT

Here rddhadese refers to the village of the name Ekacakra in the district of
Birbhum, next to Burdwan. After the Burdwan railway station there is another
branch line, which is called the Loop Line of the eastern railway, and there is a rail-
way station of the name Mallarapura. Eight miles east of this railway station
Ekacakra Village is still situated. Ekacakra Village extends north and south for an
area of about eight miles. Other villages, namely Viracandra-pura and Virabhadra-
pura, are situated within the area of the village of Ekacakra. In honor of the holy
name of Virabhadra Gosvami, these places are renowned as Viracandra-pura and
Virabhadra-pura.

In the Bengali year 1331 a thunderbolt struck the temple of Ekacakra-grama.
Therefore the temple is now in a broken state. Before this, there were no such ac-
cidents in that quarter. Within the temple there is a Deity of 9 प्न Krsna established
by ऽ Nityananda Prabhu. The name of the Deity 15 Baitkima Raya or Banka Raya.


--- Page 86 ---
Text 61] The Advent of Lord Caitanya 85

On the right side of Bankima Raya is a Deity of Jahnava, and on His left side is
Srimati Radharani. The priests of the temple describe that Lord Nityananda Prabhu
entered within the body of Bartkima Raya and that the Deity of Jahnava-mata was
therefore later placed on the right side of Bankima Raya. Afterwards, many other
Deities were installed within the temple. On another throne within the temple are
Deities of Muralidhara and Radha-Madhava. On another throne are Deities of Mano-
mohana, Vindavana-candra and Gaura-Nitai. But Barikima Raya is the Deity origin-
ally installed by Nityananda Prabhu.

On the eastern side of the temple is a ghdza known as Kadamba-khandi on the
bank of the Yamuna, and it is said that the Deity of Barikima Raya was floating in
the water and Lord Nityananda Prabhu picked Him up and then instailed Him in
the temple. Thereafter, in a place known 25 81739930013 in the village of Viracandra-
pura, about half a mile west, in a place underneath a nima tree, Srimati Radharant
was found. For this reason, the Radharani of Banikima Raya was known as Bhadda-
purera Thakurani, the mistress of 81739030013. On another throne, on the right
side of Bannkima Raya, is a Deity of Yogamaya.

Now the temple and temple corridor rest on a high plinth, and on a concrete
structure in front of the temple is a meeting hall. ft is also said that on the northern
side of the temple there was a Deity of Lord Siva named Bhandisvara and that the
father of Nityananda Prabhu, Hadai Pandita, used to worship that Deity. At present,
however, the Bhandiévara Deity is missing, and in his place a Jagannatha Svami
Deity has been installed. Lord Nityananda Prabhu did not factually construct any
temples. The temple was constructed at the time of Virabhadra Prabhu. In the
Bengali year 1298, the temple being in 2 delapidated condition, a brahmacdri of the
name Sivananda Svami repaired it.

In this temple there is an arrangement to offer foodstuffs to the Deity on the ba-
sis of seventeen seers of rice and necessary vegetables. The present priestly order of
the temple belongs to the family of Gopijana-vallabhananda, one of the branches
of Nityananda Prabhu. There is a land settlement in the name of the temple, and
income from this land finances the expenditures for the temple. There are three
parties of priestly gosvdmis who take charge of the temple management one after
another. A few steps onward fromthe tempieis a place known as Viéramatal3, where
it is said that Nityananda Prabhu in His childhood used to enjoy sporting in various
pastimes of Vyndavana and the pastime of (250-/7 with His boy friends.

Near the temple is a place named Amalitald, which is so named because of a big
tamarind tree there. According to a party named the Nedadi-sampradaya, Virabhadra
Prabhu, with the assistance of twelve hundred Nedas, dug a great lake of the name
Svetagariga. Outside of the temple are tombs of the Gosvamis, and there is a small
river known as the Maudesvara, which is called the water of Yamuna. Within half a
mile from this small river is the birthplace of Sri Nityananda Prabhu. It appears that
there was a big meeting hall in front of the temple, but later it became dilapidated
it is now covered by banyan trees. Later on, a temple was constructed within which
Gaura-Nityananda Deities are existing. The temple was constructed by the late
Prasannakumara Karapharma. A tablet was installed in his memory in the Bengali
year 1323 in the month of Vaisakha (April-May).


--- Page 87 ---
86 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Adi-Ia, Ch. 13

The place where Nityananda Prabhu appeared is called Garbhavasa. There is an
allotment of about forty-three bighds of land to continue the worship in a temple
there. The Maharaja of Dinajapura donated twenty bighds of land in this connec-
tion. It is said that near the place known as Garbhavasa, Hadai Pandita conducted a
primary school. The priests of this place, listed in a genealogical table, were as
follows: (1) Sri Raghavacandra, (2) Jagadananda dasa, {3} Krsnadasa, {4} Nityananda
dasa, (5) Ramadasa, (6) Vrajamohana dasa, (7) Kanai dasa, (8) Gauradasa, (9)
Sivananda dasa and (10) Haridasa. Krsnadasa belonged to the Cidiya-kunja at
Vrndavana. The date of his disappearance is Krspa-janmastami. Cidiya-kuhja is a
place now managed by the gosvdmls of Sirigara-ghata in Vrndavana. They are also
known as belonging to the Nityananda family, most probably on the basis of their
relationship with Krsnadasa.

Near Garbhavasa is a place called Bakulatafa, where 41 Nityananda Prabhu and
His boy friends used to take part in sporting activities known as jhala-jhapeta. There
is a bakula tree there that is wonderful because all its branches and sub-branches
look like the hoods of serpents. It has been suggested that by the desire of Sri
Nityananda Prabhu, Anantadeva manifested Himself in that way. The tree is very
old. ft is said that formerly it had two branches, but later on, when the playmates of
Nityananda Prabhu feit inconvenience in jumping from one branch to another,
Nityananda Prabhu, by His mercy, merged the two branches into one.

Another place nearby is named Hantugada. It is said that Lord Nityananda
Prabhu brought all the holy places there. Therefore the people in the surrounding
villages go there instead of to the Ganges to take bath. It is named 17371083903 be-
cause Srila Nityananda Prabhu used to perform the dadhi-cida festival of distribut-
ing chipped rice with yogurt prasada there and He took the prasdda kneeling down.
A sanctified lake in this place is always full of water throughout the year. A great
fair is held there during Gosthastami, and there is another big fair on the birthday
of Sri Nityananda Prabhu. In the Gaura-gapoddesa-dipika it is described that
Halayudha, Baladeva, Visvaripa and Sarikarsana appeared as Nityananda Avadhuta.

cesses of philosophical speculation, mystic yoga, unnecessary austerity and so-called
religious rituals. They do not accept any process but devotional service.
PURPORT
Our Krsna consciousness movement follows this principle. We do not recognize
any method for spiritual realization other than K{sna consciousness, devotional
service. Sometimes we are criticized by groups following jfidna, yoga, tapas or
dharma, but fortunately we are unable to make any compromises with them. We
simply stand on the platform of devotional service and preach the same principles
all over the world.

A bona fide devotee of Lord Krsna is always pained to see the fallen condition
of the whole world. Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura used to say, "There is
no scarcity of anything within this world. The only scarcity is of K¢sna conscious-
ness.” That is the vision of ali pure devotees. Because of this lack of Krsna conscious-
ness in human society, people are suffering terribly, being merged in an ocean of
nescience and sense gratification. A devotee onlooker is very much aggrieved to see
such asituation in the world.

PURPORT
Tulasi leaves and Ganges water, with, if possible, a little pulp of sandalwood, is
sufficient paraphernalia to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord
says in Bhagavad-gita:
patra puspar phalari toyarm
yo me bhaktyd prayacchati
tad ahari1 bhakty-upahrtam
asnami prayatatmanah
“If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit or water, | will ac-
cept it.” (Bg. 9.26) Following this principle, Advaita Prabhu pleased the Supreme
Personality of Godhead with tu/asi leaves and water of the Ganges.

appeared in Panderapura in the district of Solapura. As an incarnation of Sankarsana,
He is both the ingredient and immediate cause of the creation of this material
world. He is nondifferent from Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, as 0/750 and arirs7, or the
part and the whole, are not different. He belongs to the quadruple manifestation of
caturvy@ha as an incarnation of Sankarsana. In the Gaura-candrodaya it is said that
Visvarupa, after His so-called demise, remained mixed within SriNityananda Prabhu.

TRANSLATION
The husband and wife [Jagannatha Misra and Sacimata], having gotten
Visvariipa as their son, were very pleased within their minds. Because of their
pleasure, they specifically began to serve the lotus feet of Govinda.
PURPORT
There is a common saying in India that everyone goes to worship the Supreme
Personality of Godhead when he is in distress, but when a person is in an opulent
position, he forgets God. In Bhagavad-gita (7.16) this is also confirmed:
catur-vidhd bhajante marh
jandah sukrtino ‘rjuna
arto jijhdsur artharthi
jRani ca bharatarsabha
“If backed by pious activities in the past, four kinds of men—namely, those who are
distressed, those in need of money, those searching after knowledge and those who
are inquisitive—become interested in devotional service.” The husband and wife,
Jagannatha Misra and Sacimata, were very unhappy because their eight daughters
had passed away. Now, when they got Visvariipa as their son, certainly they became
extremely happy. They knew that it was by the grace of the Lord that they were
endowed with such happiness and opulence. Therefore instead of forgetting the
Lord, they become more and more adherent in rendering service to the lotus feet of
Govinda. When a common man becomes opulent, he forgets God; but the more
opulent a devotee becomes by the grace of the Lord, the more he becomes attached
to the service of the Lord.

parents thirteen full months before His birth. Generally a common child remains
within the womb of his mother for ten months, but here we see that the Lord re-
mained within the body of His mother for thirteen months.

“Anywhere and everywhere | go, all people offer me respect. Even without my

PURPORT

A brahmana does not become anyone's servant. To render service to someone
6156 is the business of the s@dras. A brahmana is always independent because he is a
teacher, spiritual master and advisor to society. The members of society provide
him with ail the necessities for life. In Bhagavad-gita the Lord has divided society
into four divisions—bréhmana, ksatriya, vaiSya and sadra. A society cannot run
smoothly without this scientific division. A brahmana should give good advice to all
the members of the society, a ksatriya should look after the administration, law and
order of the society, vaisyas should produce and trade in all the needs of the
society, whereas 54/८5 should render service to the higher sections of society (the
bréhmanas, ksatriyas and vaisyas).

Jagannatha Misra was a brahmana. Therefore people would send him all bodily
necessities—money, cloth, grain and so on. While Lord Caitanya was in the womb of
Sacimata, Jagannatha Misra received all these necessities of life without asking for
them. Because of the presence of the Lord in his family, everyone offered him due
respect as a brdhmanpa. In other words, if a bréhmana or Vaisnava sticks to his posi-
tion as an eternal servant of the Lord and executes the will of the Lord, there is no
question of scarcity for his personal maintenance or the needs of his family.

TRANSLATION

After this conversation, both husband and wife were very jubilant, and together

they rendered service to the household salagrama-sila.
PURPORT

Especially in every 8/73/7/77000 5 house there must be a $a/agrama-$ild to be wor-
shiped by the brahmapa family. This system is still current. People who are brahmana
by caste, who are born in a brahmapa family, must worship the salagrama-sila. Un-
fortunately, with the progress of Kali-yuga, the so-called brahmanas, although very
proud of taking birth in brdhmapa families, no longer worship the salagrama-sila.
But actually it has been a custom since time immemorial that a person born in a
brahmana family must worship the $d/agrama-$ild in all circumstances. In our Krsna
consciousness society, some of the members are very anxious to introduce the sd/a-
grama-$ifd, but we have purposely refrained from introducing it because most of the
members of the Krsna consciousness movement do not originally come from families
of the brahmana caste. After some time, when we find that they are actually situated
strictly in the line of brahminical behavior, this $a/agrama-sifé wiil be introduced.

In this age, the worship of the 3d/agrdma-sild is not as important as the chanting
of the holy name of the Lord. That is the injunction of the $a@stra. Harer nama harer
nama harer namaiva kevalari kalau ndsty eva ndsty eva ndsty eva gatir anyatha. Srila
JivaGosvami's opinion is that by chanting the holy name offenselessly one becomes
completely perfect. Nevertheless, just to purify the situation of the mind, worship of
the Deity in the temple is also necessary. Therefore when one is advanced in spiritual
consciousness or is perfectly situated on a spiritual platform he may take to the
worship of the sa/agrama-sila.

_ The transferring of the Lord from the heart of Jagannatha Misra to the heart of
Sacimata is explained by Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura as follows: “It is
to be concluded that Jagannatha Misra and Sacimaita are nitya-siddhas, ever purified
associates of the Lord. Their hearts are always uncontaminated, and therefore they
never forget the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A common man in this material
world has a contaminated heart. He must therefore first purify his heart to come to


--- Page 101 ---
100 Sr Caitanya-caritamrta [Adi-lia, Ch. 13
the transcendental position. But Jagannatha Misra and Sacimata were not a common
man and woman with contaminated hearts. When the heart is uncontaminated, it is
said to be in the existential position of vasudeva. Vasudeva can beget Vasudeva, or
Krsna, who is transcendentally situated."

It is to be understood that Sacidevi did not become pregnant as an ordinary
woman becomes pregnant because of sense indulgence. One should not think the
pregnancy of Sacimata to be that of an ordinary woman because that is an offense.
One can understand the pregnancy of Sacimata when one is actually advanced in
spiritual consciousness and fully engaged in the devotional service of the Lord.

In the $rimad-Bhagavatam (10.2.16) it is stated:

bhagavan api visvatma

bhaktanam abhayarikarah
avivesamsa-bhagena
mana Gnakadundubheh
This is a statement regarding the birth of Lord Krsna. The incarnation of the Lord
entered the mind of Vasudeva and was then transferred to the mind of Devaki. Srila
Sridhara ऽवा gives the following annotation in this connection: ‘mana avivesa’
manasy avirbabhava; jivanam iva na dhatu-sambandha ity arthah. There was no
question of the seminal discharge necessary for the birth of an ordinary human
being. Srila Rapa Gosvam7 aiso comments in this connection that Lord Krsna first
appeared in the mind of Anakadundubhi, Vasudeva, and was then transferred to
the mind of Devaki-devi. Thus the spiritual bliss in the mind of Devaki-devi gradually
increased, just as the moon increases every night until it becomes a full moon. At
the time of His appearance, Lord Krsna came out of the mind of Devaki and ap-
peared within the prison house of Karmsa by the side of Devaki's bed. At that time,
by the spell of yogamdya, Devaki thought that her child had now been born.
In this connection, even the demigods from the celestial kingdom were also be-
wildered. As it is stated, muhyanti yat sarayah (Bhdg. 1.1.1). They came to offer
their prayers to Devaki, thinking that the Supreme Lord was within her womb.
The demigods came to Mathura from their celestial kingdom. This indicates that
Mathura is still more important than the celestial kingdom of the upper planetary
system.

Lord Krsna, as the eternal son of Yasodamayi, is always present in Vrndavana.
The pastimes of Lord Krsna are continuously going on within both this material
world and the spiritual world. In such pastimes, the Lord always thinks Himself the
eternal son of mother Yasoda and father Nanda Maharaja. In the Tenth Canto of
Srimad-Bhagavatam, Chapter Six, verse 43, it is stated, “When magnanimous, broad-
hearted Nanda Maharaja came back from a tour, he immediately took his son Krsna
on his lap and experienced transcendental bliss by smetling His head.’ Similarly, in
the Tenth Canto, Ninth Chapter, verse 21, it is said, “This Personality of Godhead,
appearing as the son of a cowherd damsel, is easily available and understandable to
devotees, whereas those who are under the concept of bodily life, even though they


--- Page 102 ---
Text 87] The Advent of Lord Caitanya 101
are very advanced in austerity and penance or even though they are great philoso-
phers, are unable to understand Him."

Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura next quotes Sripada Baladeva
Vidyabhtisana, who refers to the prayers offered by the demigods to Lord Krsna
in the womb of Devakl and summarizes the birth of Krsna as follows: “As the rising
moon manifests light in the east, so Devaki, who was always situated on the
transcendental platform, having been initiated in the Krsna mantra by Vasudeva,
the son of Sirasena, kept Krsna within her heart.’ From this statement of Srimad-
Bhagavatam {10.2.18} it is understood that the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
having been transferred from the heart of Anakadundubhi, or Vasudeva, manifested
Himself in the heart of Devaki. According to Srila Baladeva Vidyabhusana, the
“heart of Devaki" means the womb of Devaki because in the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
Tenth Canto, Second Chapter, verse 41, the demigods say, diszyamba te Ruksi-
gatap 20/८८ pumdn: ‘Mother Devaki, the Lord is already within your womb."
Therefore, that the Lord was transferred from the heart of Vasudeva to the heart
of Devaki means that He was transferred to the womb of Devaki.

Similarly, in regard to the appearance of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu as described
in the Caitanya-caritémyta, the words visese sevana kare govinda-carapa, ‘‘they
specifically began to worship the lotus feet of Govinda,” indicate that exactly as
Krsna appeared in the heart of Devaki through the heart of Vasudeva, so Lord
Caitanya appeared in the heart of Sacidevi through the heart of ] 38317731073 Misra.
This is the mystery of the appearance of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Consequently,
one should not think of Lord Caitanya’s appearance as that of a common man or
living entity. This subject matter is alittle difficult to understand, but for devotees
of the Lord it will not at all be difficult to realize the statements given by Krsnadasa
Kaviraja Gosvami.

SYNONYMS
simha—the lion; rasi—sign of the zodiac; sir7ha— the lion; /agna— birth moment;
ucca—high; graha-gana—all planets; sar-varga—six area; asta-varga— eight area; sarva—

TRANSLATION
According to the Jyotir Veda, or Vedic astronomy, when the figure of the lion
appears both in the zodiac and the time of birth [lagna], this indicates a very high
conjunction of planets, an area under the influence of sad-varga and asta-varga, which
are all-auspicious moments.
PURPORT
The divisions of the sag-varga area are technically called ksetra, hora, drekkana,
navamsa, dvadasarnsa and trirnsarmsa. According to )yotir-vedic astrology, when it is
calculated who rules the constellation of six areas, the auspicious moment is calcu-
lated. Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura, who was previously also a great
astrologer, says that in the book named Brhaj-jGtaka and other books there are
directions for knowing the movements of the stars and planets. One who knows
the process of drawing a straight line and thus understands the area of asta-varga
can explain the auspicious constellations. This science is known especially by per-
sons who are called hora-sastra-vit, or those who know the scripture of the name
Hord. On the strength of astrological calculations from the Hora scripture, Nilambara
Cakravarti, the grandfather of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, ascertained the auspicious
moment in which the Lord would appear.

and thus a lunar eclipse takes place. 1015 customary in India that all the followers
of the Vedic scriptures take bath in the Ganges or the sea as soon as there is a lunar
or solar eclipse. All strict followers of Vedic religion stand up in the water through-
out the whole period of the eclipse and chant the Hare Krsna mahd-mantra. At the
time of the birth of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu such a lunar eclipse took place, and
naturally all the people standing in the water were chanting Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna,
Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.

chanted during the lunar eclipse the Mohammedans also imitated them. Thus the

It is understood that Advaita Prabhu, at that time, was in His own paternal house
at Santipura. Haridasa Thakura frequently used to meet Him. Coincidentally, there-
fore, he was also there, and upon the birth of Sri'Caitanya Mahaprabhu both of them
immediately began to dance. But no one in Santipura could understand why those
two saintly persons were dancing.

Text 101] The Advent of Lord Caitanya 109
TRANSLATION
Seeing the lunar eclipse and laughing, both Advaita Acarya and Haridasa Thakura
immediately went to the bank of the Ganges and bathed in the Ganges in great
jubilation. Taking advantage of the occasion of the lunar eclipse, Advaita Acarya,
by His own mental strength, distributed various types of charity to the brahmarias.
PURPORT
It is the custom of Hindus to give in charity to the poor as much as possible
during the time of a lunar or solar eclipse. Advaita Acarya, therefore, taking ad-
vantage of this eclipse, distributed many varieties of charity to the brd@hmapas.
In the Srimad-Bhdgavatam there is a statement in the Tenth Canto, Third Chapter,
verse 11, that when Krsna took His birth, immediately Vasudeva, taking advantage
of this moment, distributed ten thousand cows to the brdhrnanas. It is customary
among Hindus that at the time a child is born, especially a male child, the parents
distribute great charity in jubilation. Advaita Acarya was actually interested in dis
tributing charity because of Lord Caitanya’s birth at the time of the lunar eclipse.
People could not understand, however, why Advaita Acarya was giving such a
great variety of things in charity. He did so not because of the lunar eclipse but
because of the Lord’s taking birth at that moment. He distributed charity exactly
as Vasudeva did at the time of Lord Krsna’s appearance.

In outer space all the demigods, including the inhabitants of Gandharvaloka,
Siddhaloka and Caranaloka, offered their prayers and danced with musical songs
and the beating of drums. Similarly, in Navadvipa city all the professional dancers,
musicians and blessers gathered together, dancing in great jubilation.
PURPORT
As there are professional singers, dancers and reciters of prayers in the heavenly
planets,so in India still there are professional dancers, givers of blessings and singers,
all of whom assemble together during householder ceremonies, especially marriages
and birth ceremonies. These professional men earn their livelihood by taking
charity on such occasions from the homes of the Hindus. Eunuchs also take ad-
vantage of such ceremonies to receive charity. That is their means of livelihood.
Such men never become servants or engage themselves in agriculture or business
occupations; they simply take charity from neighborhood friends to maintain
themselves peacefully, The bhdtas are a class of brahmapas who go to such cere-
monies to offer blessings by composing poems with references to the Vedic
scriptures.

all auspicious gifts for such a ceremony. As there is puffed rice, so there is another
preparation of rice called €८-#, or fused rice, which, along with bananas, is taken

as a very auspicious presentation. Also, turmeric mixed with oil and vermilion
makes an auspicious ointment that is smeared over the body of a newly born baby
or a person who is going to marry. These are all auspicious activities in family
affairs. We see that five hundred years ago at the birth of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu
all these ceremonies were performed rigidly, but at present such ritualistic per-
formances hardly ever take place, Generally a pregnant mother is sent to the hospital,
and as soon as her child is born he is washed with an antiseptic, and this concludes
everything.

One day shortly after Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu was born, Advaita Acarya’s
wife 9171५९५१, who is worshipable by the whole world, taking permission of her
husband, went to see that topmost child with all kinds of gifts and presentations.
PURPORT
It appears that Advaita Acirya had two different houses, one at Santipura and
one at Navadvipa. When Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhy was born, Advaita Acarya was
residing not at His Navadvipa house but at His Santipura house. Therefore, as
formeriy explained, “nija@laya,” from Advaita’s old paternal house in Santipura,
9112 came to Navadvipa to present gifts to the newly born child, Caitanya
Mahaprabhu.

made of silk. Many other riches, including gold and silver coins, were 2150 presented
to the child.
PURPORT
From the gifts presented by Sita ThakuranT, Advaita Acarya’s wife, it appears that
Advaita Acarya was at that time a very rich man. Although brahmanas are not the
rich men of society, Advaita Acarya, being the leader of the brdhmapas in Santipura,
was considerably well-to-do. Therefore He presented many ornaments to the baby,
Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu. But Kamalakanta Viévasa’s asking for three hundred
rupees from the King of Jagannatha Puri, Maharaja Prataparudra, on the plea that
Advaita Acarya was in debt for that amount, indicates that such a rich man, who
could present many valuable ornaments, saris, etc., thought it difficult to repay
three hundred rupees. Therefore the value of a rupee at that time was many thou-
sands of times greater than it is now. At the present, no one feeis difficulty over a
debt of three hundred rupees, nor can an ordinary man accumulate such valuable
ornaments to present to a friend’s son. Probably the value of three hundred rupees
at that time was equal to the present value of thirty thousand rupees.

Text 115] The Advent of Lord Caitanya 119
PURPORT
The words vastra-gupta dol/a are very significant in this verse. Even fifty or sixty
years ago in Calcutta, all respectable ladies would go to a neighboring place riding
on a palanquin carried by four men. The palanquin was covered with soft cotton,
and in that way there was no chance to see a respectable lady traveling in public.
Ladies, especially those coming from respectable families, could not be seen by
ordinary men. This system is still current in remote places. The Sanskrit word
asarya-pasyd indicates that a respectable lady could not be seen even by the sun.
In the oriental culture this system was very much prevalent and was strictly ob-
served by respectable ladies, both Hindu and Moslem. We have actual experience
in our childhood that our mother would not go next door to her house to observe
an invitation by walking; she would go in either a carriage or a palanquin carried
by four men. This custom was also strictly followed five hundred years ago, and the
wife of Advaita Acarya, being a very respectable lady, observed the customary rutes
current in that social environment.

TRANSLATION

She blessed the newly born child by placing fresh grass and paddy on His head
and saying, “May You be blessed with a long duration of life." But being afraid of
ghosts and witches, she gave the child the name Nimai.

PURPORT

0310 and SankhinT are two companions of Lord Siva and his wife who are sup-
posed to be extremely inauspicious, having been born of ghostly life. 1115 believed
that such inauspicious living creatures cannot go near a /7/77৫ tree. At least medically
it is accepted that nima wood is extremely antiseptic, and formerly it was customary
to have a nima tree in front of one’s house. On very large roads in India, especially
in Uttar Pradesh, there are hundreds and thousands of nima trees. Nima wood is so
antiseptic that the Ayurvedic science uses it to cure leprosy. Medical scientists have
extracted the active principle of the nima tree, which is called margosic acid. Nima
is used for many purposes, especially to brush the teeth. In Indian villages ninety
percent of the people use nima twigs for this purpose. Because of all the antiseptic
effects of the nima tree and because Lord Caitanya was born beneath a nima tree,
Sita Thakurani gave the Lord the name Nimai. Later in His youth He was celebrated
as Nimai Pandita, and in the neighborhood villages He was called by that name,
although His real name was Visvambhara.

TRANSLATION

On the day the mother and son took bath and left the maternity home, Sita
Thakurani gave them all kinds of ornaments and garments and then also honored
Jagannatha Misra. Then Sita Thakurani, being honored by mother Sacidevi and
Jagannatha Misra, was greatly happy within her mind, and thus she returned home.

PURPORT

On the fifth day from the birth of a child, as 2{50 on the ninth day, the mother
takes bath either in the Ganges or in a sacred place. This is called niskramana, or
the ceremony of coming out of the maternity home. Nowadays the maternity home
is a hospital, but formerly in every respectable house one room was set aside as a
maternity home where children would take birth, and on the ninth day after the
birth of a child the mother would come into the regular rooms in the ceremony
cailed niskrarmapa. Of the ten purificatory processes, niskramana is one. Formerly,
especially in Bengal, the higher castes observed four months after the birth of a
child as a quarantine. At the end of the fourth month, the mother first had to see
the sun rise. Later the higher castes, namely, the brghmanas, ksatriyas and vaisyas,
observed only twenty-one days as a quarantine, whereas the 5६/25 had to observe
thirty days. For the sections of society known as kartabhaja and satima, the mother
of the child was immediately purified after the quarantine by the throwing of कका
nuta, small pieces of sweetmeat, in sar?kirtana. Sacidevi and ] 38317173103 Misra, with
the newly born child, were honored by Sita Thakurani. Similarly, whife Sita
Thakurani was returning home, she was also honored by Sacidevi and Jagannatha
Misra. That was the system in respectable families of Bengal.

son, also became very much pleased within their hearts.

In this connection Srimat Prabodhinanda Sarasvati has composed the foilowing
verses in his Caitanya-candramyta:

“This material world is without Krsna consciousness. Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu is

does not understand Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, certainly he is wandering uselessty
in this world.”

“The advent of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu is just like an expanding ocean of
nectar. One who does not collect the valuable jewels within this ocean is certainly

Similarly, the Srimad-8hagavatam (2.3.19, 20, 23) states:

animal. Such big animals are generally praised by other animals like dogs, hogs,
camels and asses. A person who does not lend his aural reception to hearing about
the Supreme Personality of Godhead must be considered to have earholes like
holes in a field. Although that person has a tongue, it is like the tongue of a frog,
which unnecessarily creates a disturbance by croaking, inviting the snake of death.
Similarly, a person who neither takes advantage of the dust of the lotus feet of great
devotees nor smells the tu/asi leaves offered to the lotus feet of the Lord must be
considered dead even though he is supposedly working.”

Similarly, the Srimad-Bhdgavatam, Tenth Canto, Chapter One, verse 4, states:

“Who but the animal-killer or the killer of the soul will not care to hear glorifica-
tion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead? Such glorification is enjoyed by
persons liberated from the contamination of this material world.”

Similarly, in the Third Canto, Chapter Twenty-three, verse 56, the Bhdgavatam
says, (10 tirthapada-sevayai jivann api mrto hi sah: “Although a person is apparently
living, if he does not serve the lotus feet of great devotees he is 10 be considered

TRANSLATION

Taking on my head as my own property the lotus feet of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu,
Nityananda Prabhu, Acarya Advaitacandra, 5५21002 Damodara, Rapa Gosvami and
Raghunatha dasa Gosvamf, |, Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami, have thus described the
advent of Sri’ Caitanya Mahaprabhu.

PURPORT

Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, Nityananda, Advaita Prabhu, Svariipa Damodara,
Ripa Gosvami, Raghunatha dasa and their followers are all accepted by Krsnadasa
Kaviraja GosvamT. Anyone who follows in the footsteps of Kavirdja Gosvami also
accepts the lotus feet of the above-mentioned lords as his personal property. Fora
materialistic person, material wealth and opulence are only illusory. Actually they
are not possessions but entanglements because by enjoying the material world a
conditioned soul becomes more and more entangled by incurring debts for his
present enjoyment. Unfortunately, a conditioned soul considers property for which
he is in debt to be his own, and he is very busy acquiring such property. But a
devotee considers such property not real property but simply an entanglement in
the material world. If Lord Krsna is very much pleased with a devotee, He takes
away his material property, as stated in the $rimad-8Bhagovatam {10.88.8), where
Lord Krsna says, yasyaham anugrhpami harisye 10000077017 $anait: ' 10 show special
favor to a devotee, | take away all his material property." Similarly, Narottama
dasa Thakura says:

dhana mora nityananda,

radhakrspa-$ricarana

sei mora prapadhana
“My real riches are Nityananda Prabhu and the lotus feet of Sri Radha and Krsna."
He further prays, “O Lord, kindly give me this opulence. | do not want anything
but Your lotus feet as my property." Srila Narottama 0353 Thakura has sung in
many places that his real property is the lotus feet of Radha and Krsna. Unfor-
tunately we are interested in unreal property and are neglecting our real property
(adhane yatana kari’ dhana teyaginu).

Sometimes smadrtas consider Raghunatha dasa Gosvami 2 $&dra. But Krsnadasa
Kaviraja Gosvami here especially mentions svargpa-riapa-raghunathadasa. Therefore
one who considers the lotus feet of Raghunatha dasa to be transcendental to ail
divisions of the caste system enjoys the riches of actual spiritual bliss.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Sri Caitanya-caritamrta, 20113,
Thirteenth Chapter, describing the advent of Lord $7 Caitanya Mahaprabhu.

Lord Caitanya’s Childhood Pastimes

Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura has given a summary of this chapter in his Amyta-
pravéha-bhdsya: “In this Fourteenth Chapter of the Caitanya-caritamrta there is a
description of how Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu enjoyed His childhood pastimes,
crawling, crying and eating dirt, giving intelligence to His mother, favoring a bréahmana
guest, riding on the shoulders of two thieves and misleading them to His own house,
and, on the plea of being diseased, taking prasdda in the house of Hiranya and
Jagadisa on the Ekadasi day. The chapter further describes how He displayed Him-
self as a naughty boy, how when His mother faint d He brought a coconut to her
on His head, how He joked with girls of the same age on the banks of the Ganges,
how He accepted worshipful paraphernalia from Srimati Laksmidevi, how He sat
down in a garbage pit wherefrom He instructed transcendental knowledge, how He
left the pit on the order of His mother, and how He dealt with His father with full
affection.”

PURPORT

In his book Caitanya-candramyta Srila Prabodhananda Sarasvati says: “One who

receives a little favor from the Lord becomes so exalted that he does not care even

for liberation, which is sought after by many great scholars and philosophers. Simi-
larly, a devotee of Lord Caitanya considers residence in the heavenly planets a
will-o’-the-wisp. He surpasses the perfection of mystic yoga power because for him
the senses are like snakes with broken fangs. A snake is a very fearful and dangerous
animal because of his poison fangs, but if these fangs are broken the appearance of
a snake is no cause for fear. The yoga principles are meant to control the senses,
but there is no scope for the senses of one engaged in the service of the Lord to be
dangerous like snakes. These are the gifts of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu."

The Hari-bhakti-vilasa confirms that difficult things become easy to understand
if one remembers Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and easy things become very difficult
to understand if one forgets Him. We actually see that even those who are very great
scientists in the eyes of the genera! public cannot understand the very simple idea
that life comes from life because they do not have the mercy of Caitanya
Mahaprabhu. They defend the false understanding that life comes from matter,
although they cannot prove this is a fact. Modern civlization, therefore, progressing
on the basis of this false scientific theory, is simply creating problems to be solved
by the so-called scientists.

The author of Caitanya-caritamyta takes shelter of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu to
describe the pastimes of His appearance as a child because one cannot write such
transcendental literature by mental speculation. One who writes about the Supreme
Personality of Godhead must be especially favored by the Lord. Simply by academic
qualifications it is not possible to write such literature.

the son of mother Saci (vrajendra-nandana yei, saci-suta haila sei). The son of Saci

TRANSLATION
Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto the childhood pastimes of Lord ऽ
Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who is Lord Krsna 14175611. Although such pastimes appear
exactly like those of an ordinary child, they should be understood as various
pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
PURPORT
In Bhagavad-gité this statement is confirmed as follows:
avafdnanti mari miadha manusirh tanum asritam
(20/07 bhdvam ajananto mama bhiita-mahesvaram
“Fools deride Me when | descend in the human form. They do not know My tran-
scendental nature and My supreme dominion over all that be.” (Bg. 9.11) The
Supreme Personality of Godhead appears on this planet or within this universe
like an ordinary human being or human child to execute His pastimes, yet He
maintains His superiority as the Supreme Lord. Lord Krsna appeared as a human
child, but His uncommon activities, even in His childhood, like the kilting of the
demon Patani or lifting of Govardana Hill, were not the engagements of an ordi-
nary child. Similarly, although the pastimes of Lord Caitanya, as they will be
described in this chapter, appear like the activities of a small boy, they are uncom-
mon pastimes impossible for an ordinary human child to execute.

TRANSLATION
In His first childhood pastimes the Lord turned upside down while lying on His
bed, and thus He showed His parents the marks of His lotus feet.
PURPORT
The word uttana is also used to mean “lying down on the bed face upwards’ or
“lying down flat on the bed.” [n some readings the word is utthana, which means
“standing up.” In His childhood pastimes the Lord tried to catch the wall and stand
up, but as an ordinary child falls down, so the Lord also fell down and again took
to lying on His bed.

TRANSLATION
Jagannatha Misra said: “Certainly child Krsna is with the salagrama-$ila. Taking
His childhood form, He is playing within the room.”
PURPORT
When the <2/04/2/770-4//@ or form of the Lord is engraved in wood, stone or any
other element, it is to be understood that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is
there. Even logically we can understand that all material elements are expansions of
the energy of the Lord. Since the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is
nondifferent from His personal body, the Lord is always present in His energy, and
He manifests Himself on account of the ardent desire of a devotee. Since the Lord
is supremely powerful, it is logical that He can manifest Himself in His energy. The
Deity worship or worship of the $dlagréma-$ila is not idol worship. The Deity of
the Lord in the house of a pure devotee can act exactly as He can in His original
transcendental personality.

PURPORT
It is the Vedic principle to observe a festival in connection with Narayana and
brahmapas. Giving a child a particular name is among the purificatory processes,
which are known as dasa-vidha-sarhskdra, and on the day of such a ceremony one
should observe a festival by worshiping Narayana and distributing prasada, chiefly
among the brahmagas.
When Nilambara Cakravarti, Sacimata and Jagannatha Misra, recognizing the
marks on the Lord’s lotus feet, understood that the child Nimai was not an ordi-

Text 19] Lord Caitanya's Childhood Pastimes 139
nary child but an incarnation of Narayana, they decided that on that very same
day, which was very auspicious, they should observe a festival for His name-giving
ceremony. In this connection we can particularly see how an incarnation of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead is ascertained by His bodily symptoms, His activi-
ties and the prediction of the $054705. By factual evidence a person can be accepted
as an incarnation of God, not whimsically or by the votes of rascals and fools. There
have been many imitation incarnations in Bengal since the appearance of Lord
Caitanya, but any impartial devotee or learned man can understand that Lord
Caitanya Mahaprabhu was accepted as an incarnation of Krsna not on the basis of
popular votes but by evidence from the sdstras and bona fide scholars. It was not
ordinary men who accepted Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu as the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. In the beginning His identity was ascertained by learned scholars
like Nilambara Cakravarti, and later all His activities were confirmed by the six
Gosvamis, especially 913 १५2 Gosvami and Srila Rapa Gosvami, and many other
learned scholars, with evidence from the s@stra. An incarnation of God is such from
the very beginning of His life. It is not that by performing meditation one can
become an incarnation of God all of a sudden. Such false incarnations are meant for
fools and rascals, not sane men.

“In the future this child will protect and maintain all the world. For this reason

PURPORT

The Caitanya-bhagavata also confirms that Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, by His
birth, has made the whole world peaceful, as in the past Narayana protected this
earth in His incarnation as Varaha. Because of His protecting and maintaining this
world in the present Kali-yuga, Lord Caitanya Mah3prabhu is Viévambhara, which
refers to one who feeds the entire world. The movement inaugurated by Sri Caitanya

Mahaprabhu when He was present five hundred years ago is again being propagated
all over the world, and factually we are seeing its practical results. People are being

saved, protected and maintained by this Hare Krsna movement. Thousands of
followers, especially western youths, are taking part in this Hare Krsria movement,
and how safe and happy they feel can be understood from the expressions of
gratitude in their hundreds and thousands of letters. The name Visvambhara is also
mentioned in the Atharva-veda-sarnhitd (visvambhara visvena ma bharasa pahi svaha).

marriage festivals, name-giving festivals and festivals marking the beginning of edu-
cation, by especially inviting brahmanas. In every festival the brahmanas are to be
fed first, and when the brdhmanas are pleased they bless the festival by chanting
Vedic mantras or the Hare Krsna mahd-mantra.

Text 23) Lord Caitanya’s Childhood Pastimes 141
TRANSLATION
After some days the Lord began to crawl on His knees, and He caused various
wonderful things to be seen.
PURPORT
The Cuaitanya-bhagavata describes that one day while the Lord was crawling upon
His knees, the bells on His waist ringing very sweetly, a snake came out to crawl in
the yard of the Lord, who captured the snake like a curious child. Immediately the
snake coiled over Him. The Lord as a child then rested on the snake, and after some
time the snake went away, leaving aside the Lord.

TRANSLATION
The Lord caused all the ladies to chant the holy names of the Hare {< {९2 maha-
mantra on the plea of His crying, and while they chanted the Lord would smile.
PURPORT
in the Caitanya-bhagavata this pastime is described as follows: “The Lord, with
His beautiful eyes, would cry, but He would stop immediately upon hearing the
Hare Krsna mahd-mantra. When the ladies, understanding the fun of the Lord, dis-
covered that He would cry and then stop upon hearing the chanting of the Hare
Krsna mantra, they all took it as a clue to chant Hare Krsna as soon as the Lord
cried. Thus it became a regular function. The Lord would cry, and the ladies would
begin chanting the Hare Krsna mahd-mantra, clapping with their hands. In this way
all the ladies of the neighboring houses would assemble in the home of Sacimata to
join in the sankirtana movement twenty-four hours a day. As long as the ladies con-
tinued to chant the Hare Krsna mahd-mantra, the Lord would not cry but very
pleasingly smile upon them."

TRANSLATION
“This body is a transformation of dirt, and the eatables are also a transformation
of dirt. Please reflect upon this. You are blaming Me without consideration. What
can | say?”
PURPORT
This is an explanation of the Mayavada philosophy, which takes everything to be
one. The necessities of the body, namely, eating, sleeping, mating and defending,
are all unnecessary in spiritual life. When one is elevated to the spiritual platform
there are no more bodily necessities, and in activities pertaining to the bodily
necessities there are no spiritual considerations. In other words, the more we eat,
sleep, have sex and try to defend ourselves, the more we engage in material activities.
Unfortunately, Mayavadi philosophers consider devotional activities to be bodily
activities. They cannot understand the simple explanation in Bhagavad-gita:
marh ca yo 'vyabhicarena bhakti-yogena sevate
sa gunan samatityaitan brahma-bhayaya kalpate


--- Page 146 ---
Text 30] Lord Caitanya’s Childhood Pastimes 145
“Anyone who engages in spiritual devotional service without motivation, rendering
such service for the satisfaction of the Lord, is elevated immediately to the spiritual
platform, and all his activities are spiritual.” (Bg. 14.26) Brahma-bhiyaya refers
to Brahman (spiritual) activities. Although Mayavadi philosophers are very much
eager to merge in the Brahman effulgence, they have no Brahman activities. To a
certain extent they recommend Brahman activities, which for them mean engage-
ment in studying the Vedanta and Sasikhya philosophies, but their interpretations
are but dry speculation. Lacking the varieties of spiritual activity, they cannot stay
for long on that platform of simply studying Vedanta or Sarikhya philosophy.

Life is meant for varieties of enjoyment. The living entity is by nature full of an
enjoying spirit, as stated in the Vedanta-siatra (1.1.12): Gnandamayo 'bhyasat. In de-
votional service the activities are variegated and full of enjoyment. As stated in
Bhagavad-gita (9.2), all devotional activities are easy to perform (susukhari kartum),
and they are eternal and spiritual (avyayam). Since Mayavadi philosophers cannot
understand this, they take it for granted that a devotee’s activities ( $ravaparn
kirtanarn vispoh 57707000170 pada-sevanam, etc.) are all material and are therefore
maya. They also consider Krsna's advent in this universe and His activities to be
maya. Therefore, because they consider everything mdyd, they are known as
Mayavadis.

Actually, any activities performed favorably for the satisfaction of the Lord, under
the direction of the spiritual master, are spiritual. But for a person to disregard the
order of the spiritual master and act by concoction, accepting his nonsensical
activities to be spiritual, is maya. One must achieve the favor of the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead through the mercy of the spiritual master. Therefore one must
first please the spiritual master, and if he is pleased, then we should understand
that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is also pleased. But if the spiritual master
is displeased by our actions, they are not spiritual. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti
Thakura confirms this: yasya pras@dad bhagavat-prasado yasyaprasadan na gatih
kuto ‘pi. Activities that please the spiritual master must be considered spiritual,
and they should be accepted as satisfying to the Lord.

Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu, as the supreme spiritual master, instructed His
mother about the Mayavada philosophy. By saying that the body is dirt and
eatables are also dirt, He implied that everything is maya. This is Mayavada philoso-
phy. The philosophy of the Mayavadis is defective because it maintains that every-
thing is maya but the nonsense they speak. While saying that everything is maya, the
Mayavadi philosopher loses the opportunity of devotional service, and therefore his
life is doomed. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu therefore advised, mayavadi-bhasya sunile
haya sarva-nasa (Cc. Madhya 6.169). If one accepts the Mayavada philosophy, his
advancement is doomed forever.

of nourished, and thus it is destroyed.

TRANSLATION

"110 a water pot, which is a transformation of dirt, | can bring water very easily.
But if | poured water on a lump of dirt, the lump would soak up the water, and my
labor would be useless.”

PURPORT

This simple philosophy propounded by Sacimata, even though she is a woman,
can defeat the Mayavadi philosophers who speculate on oneness. The defect of
Mayavada philosophy is that it does not accept the variety that is useful for practical
purposes. Sacimata gave the example that although both the lump of dirt and the
earthen pot are basically one, for practical purposes the water pot is useful whereas
the lump of dirt is useless. Sometimes scientists argue that matter and spirit are one,
with no difference between them. Factually, in a higher sense, there is no difference
between matter and spirit, but one should have practical knowledge that matter,
being an inferior state, is useless for our spiritual blissful life, whereas spirit, being a
finer state of existence, is full of bliss. In this connection the 8hagavatam gives the
example that dirt and fire are practically one and the same. From the earth grow
trees, and from their wood come fire and smoke. Nevertheless, for heat we can
utilize the fire but not the earth, smoke or wood. Therefore, for the ultimate reali-
zation of the goal of life, we are concerned with the fire of the spirit, but not the
dull wood or earth of matter.

148 Srv Caitanya-caritamrta [Adi-lild, Ch. 14
PURPORT
if one is taught from the beginning of life the Vaignava philosophy of duality
or variety, the monistic philosophy will not very much bother him. In reality,
everything is an emanation from the supreme source (janmddy asya yatah). The
original energy is exhibited in varieties, exactly like the sunshine, the original
energy emanating from the sun, which acts as light and heat in variety. One cannot
say that light is heat and heat is light, yet one cannot separate one from the other.
Therefore Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s philosophy is acintya-bhedabheda, incon-
ceivable nonseparation and distinction. Although there is an affinity between the
two physical manifestations light and heat, there is a difference between them.
Similarly, although the whole cosmic manifestation is the Lord's energy, the energy
is nevertheless exhibited in varieties of manifestations.

PURPORT
The story of the deliverance of this brahmapa is as follows. One br@hmapa who
was touring all over the country, traveling from one place of pilgrimage to another,


--- Page 151 ---
150 ও Caitanya-caritamrta [Adi-lila, Ch. 14
reached Navadvipa and became a guest in the house of Jagannatha Misra. Jagannatha
Misra gave him all ingredients for cooking, and the brafmapa prepared his foodstuffs.
When the brahmapa was offering the foodstuffs to Lord Visnu in meditation, the
child Nimd@i came before him and began to eat them, and because of this the
brahmana thought the whole offering spoiled. Therefore by the request of Jagannatha
Misra he cooked for a second time, but when he was meditating the child again
came before him and began to eat the foodstuffs, again spoiling the offering.
By the request of )agannatha Misra the brahmapa cooked for a third time,
but for a third time the Lord came before him and began to eat the food-
stuffs, although the child had been locked within a room and everyone was sleeping
because it was late at night. Thus, thinking that on that day Lord Visnu was not
willing to accept his foodstuffs and that he was therefore ordained to fast, the
brahmana became greatly agitated and cried aloud, ‘haya haya'' (“What has been
done! What has been done!’’). When Lord Caitanya Mah3prabhu saw the bréghmana
in that agitated state, He told him, “Formerly | was the son of mother Yasoda. At
that time you also became a guest in the house of Nanda Maharaja, and | disturbed
you in this way. | am very much pleased by your devotion. Therefore | am eating
the foodstuffs you have prepared.” Understanding the favor offered to him by the
Lord, the brahmapna was greatly pleased, and he was overwhelmed with love of Kisna.
He was thankful to the Lord, for he felt himself greatly fortunate. Then the Lord
asked the brdhmanpa not to disclose the incident to anyone eise. This is very
elaborately explained in the Caitanya-bhagavata, Adi-lila, Chapter Three.

In His childhood the Lord was taken away by two thieves outside His home. The

Text 39] Lord Caitanya’s Childhood Pastimes 151
PURPORT
In His childhood the Lord was profusely decorated with gold ornaments. Once
upon a time He was playing outside His house, and two thieves passing on the street
saw the opportunity to rob the Lord and therefore took Him on their shoulders,
pleasing Him by offering Him some sweetmeats. The thieves thought they would
carry the child to the forest and then kill Him and take away the ornaments. The
Lord, however, expanded His illusory energy upon the thieves, so much so that
instead of carrying Him to the forest they came right back in front of the house of
the Lord. When they came before His house they became afraid because everyone
from the house of Jagannatha Misra and all the inhabitants of that quarter were
busy searching for the child. Therefore the thieves, thinking it dangerous to remain,
went away and left Him. The child was brought within the house of mother Saci,
who was in great anxiety, and she became satisfied. This incident is also very
elaborately explained in the Adi-/ita of Caitanya-bhagavata, Third Chapter.

TRANSLATION
Pretending to be sick, the Lord asked some foodstuffs from the house of
Hirapya and Jagadisa on the day of Ekadasi.
PURPORT
The Caitanya-bhagavata, Adi-Iila, Chapter Four, fully describes the Lord's ac-
cepting vispu-prasada on the Ekadasi day at the house of Jagadisa and Hiranya.
Regular prasada is offered to Lord Visnu on Ekadasi because fasting is recommended
for devotees on Ekadasi but not for Lord Visnu. Once on Ekadasi in the house of
Jagadisa and Hiranya Pandita there were arrangements to prepare special prasida
for Lord Vispu, and Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu asked His father to go there to ask
for the vispu-prasada because He was feeling sick. The house of Jagadisa and Hiranya
Pandita was situated about two miles off from the house of jagannatha Misra.
Therefore when Jagannatha Misra, on the request of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu,


--- Page 153 ---
152 5 Caitanya-caritamrta [Adi-lila, Ch. 14
came to ask Jagadisa and Hiranya for the prasdda, they were a little astonished.
How could the boy understand that special prasdda was being prepared for Lord
Visnu? They immediately concluded that the boy Nimai must have supernatural
mystic power. Otherwise how could He understand that they were preparing special
prasada? Therefore they immediately sent the foodstuffs to Lord Caitanya
Mahaprabhu through His father, Jagannitha Misra. Nimai was feeling sick, but
immediately after eating the visnu-prasada He was cured, and He also distributed
the prasdda among His playmates.

TRANSLATION
Sacimata said: “Why do You steal others’ things? Why do You beat the other
children? And why do You go inside others’ houses? What do you not have in Your
own house?”
PURPORT
According to the Vedanta-siatra (janmady asya yatah), since creation, maintenance
and annihilation exist in the Supreme Absolute, whatever we find within this ma-
terial world is already in the spiritual world. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Krsna Himself. How is He stealing, and how is He fighting?
It is not as a thief or an enemy, but as a friend in a loving condition. He steals as a
child, not because He is in want, but as a natural instinct. In this material world
also, small children, without enmity or bad will, sometimes go to a neighboring
house and steal, and sometimes they fight. Krsna also, like other children, did all
these things in His childhood. Without the existence of the stealing propensity and
fighting propensity in the spiritual world, they cannot exist here in this material
world. The difference between the material and spiritual worlds is that stealing in
the spiritual world is done in friendship and love, whereas fighting and stealing with-
in this material world are executed on the basis of enmity and envy. Therefore we
should understand that in the spiritual world all these activities exist, but there is
no inebriety, whereas in the material world all activities are full of miserable con-

child Lord used to steal all kinds of eatables from the houses of neighboring friends.
In some houses He would steal milk and drink it, and in others He would steal and
eat prepared rice. Sometimes He would break cooking pots. If there were nothing
to eat but there were small babies, the Lord would tease the babies and make them
cry. Sometimes a neighbor would complain to Sacimata, “My child is very small.
But your child puts water in the ears of my 0110, making the child cry.”

Sometimes the Lord, with other children, would go to take bath in the Ganges,
and the neighboring girls would also come there to worship various demigods.
PURPORT
According tb the Vedic system, small girls ten or twelve years old would go to
the bank of the Ganges to take their bath and would especially worship Lord Siva
with prayers to get good husbands in the future. They especially wanted to get a
husband like Lord Siva because Lord Siva is very peaceful and at the same time
most powerful. Formerly, therefore, small girls in Hindu families would worship
Lord Siva, especially in the month of Vaisakha (April-May). To take a bath in the
Ganges is a great pleasure for everyone, not only for aduits but for children also.

Addressing the girls, the Lord would say: ‘‘Worship Me, and 1 shall give you good

Not to speak of other demigods, even Lord Siva is My servant.”
PURPORT
There is a misconception about the Hindu religion among people who profess other
religions, such as Christians and Mohammedans, who say that in the Hindu religion
there are many Gods. Actually that is not a fact. God is one, but there are many
other powerful living entities who are in charge of different departments of admini-
stration. They are called demigods. All the demigods are servants who carry out the
orders of the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead. Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu
disclosed this fact in His childhood. Out of ignorance, sometimes people worship
the demigods to receive some particular boon, but actually if one becomes a devotee
and worshiper of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he does not need to go to
the demigods for any benediction because he obtains everything by the grace of the
Supreme Lord. Bhagavad-gitd therefore condemns such demigod worship:
kdmais tais tair hrta-jnanah
prapadyante 'nya-devataf
tari (0/7 niyamam asthaya
prakrtya niyatah svaya
“Only persons whose intelligence is lost and who are mad with lusty desires wor-
ship the demigods and follow the particular rules and regulations of worship accord-
ing to their own natures.” (88. 7.20)

158 Sir Caitanya-caritamrta | Adi-lila, Ch. 14
“But persons who are freed from all sinful activities and the duality of delusion
engage themselves in the worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead with de-
termination.’ (Bg. 7.28} Only the less intelligent worship the demigods for their
various purposes. The most intelligent worship only the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Krsna.

Sometimes we, the members of the Krsna consciousness movement, are accused
of not approving of the worship of demigods. But how can we approve of this when
it is condemned by Lord Caitanya and Lord Krsna? How can we allow people to
become foolish and ((10-/75/70, bereft of intelligence? Our propaganda is simply
meant to enable intelligent people to understand the distinction between matter
and spirit and understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the whole
spiritual identity. That is our mission. How could we mislead people to worship so-
called gods in material bodies within this material world?

Our position of not allowing worship of the many hundreds of demigods is con-
firmed by Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu even in His childhood. Srila Narottama dasa
Thakura has sung in this connection:

anya devdsraya nai
tomare kahinu bhai
ei bhakti parama-karatta
“To become a staunch, pure devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead without
deviation {ananya-bhédk /, one should not divert his attention to the worship of the
demigods. Such control is a symptom of pure devotional service.”

Text 53] Lord Caitanya’s Childhood Pastimes 159
PURPORT
According to the system of worship, when something is offered to deities outside
one’s home, it is generally not cooked food, but raw rice, bananas and sweetmeats.
Out of His causeless mercy, the Lord would snatch the offerings from the girls and
eat them, admonishing the girls not to worship the demigods but to worship Him.
This worship of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is recommended in the Srimad-
Bhagavatam:
kfsna-varnpam tvisakrsparh
sarngopangastra-parsadam
yajnaih sankirtana-prayair
yajanti hi sumedhasah
“‘One should worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead who appears in this age
of Kali with His associates as Parica-tattva: the Lord Himself and His associates
Nityananda Prabhu, Sri Advaita Prabhu, Sri Gadadhara Prabhu and Srivasa Thakura.
In this age, an intelligent person worships the Pafica-tattva by the method of chant-
ing the Hare Krsna maha-mantra and, if possible, distributing prasada." (Bhag. 11.5.
32) Our Krsna consciousness movement is introducing this bona fide method of
worship in the western world. Its members are going from village to village and
town to town with Deities of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu, teaching people how to
worship the Lord by chanting the Hare Krsna mantra, offering prasada and dis-
tributing it to people in general.

Text 56) Lord Caitanya's Childhood Pastimes 161
TRANSLATION

“They will be learned, clever and young and possess abundant wealth and rice.
Not only that, but you will each have seven sons, who will all live long lives and be
very intelligent.”

PURPORT

Generally it is the ambition of a young girl to have a very handsome husband
who is learned, clever, young and rich. According to the Vedic culture, one is rich
if he possesses a large stock of food grains and a very large number of animals,
Dhanyena dhanavan gavaya dhanavan: one is rich if he possesses food grains, cows
and bulls. A girl also desires to have many children, especially sons (putra) who are
very intelligent and long living. Now there is propaganda to have one or two chil-
dren and kill the rest by contraceptive methods becausesociety has deteriorated. But
the natural ambition of a girl is to possess not only more than one child but at least
half a dozen.

In exchange for the paraphernalia of worship He usurped for Himself, Caitanya
Mahaprabhu wanted to bless the girls to fulfill all their ambitions and desires. One
can easily become happy and obtain the material benefits of a good husband,
wealth, food grains and a number of nice children by worshiping Lord Caitanya
Mahaprabhu. Although Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu accepted sannydsa at an early age,
it is not necessary for His devotees to follow Him by also taking sannydsa. One can
stay a householder, but one must be a devotee of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Then
one will be happy, with all the material opulences of a good home, good children,
good mate, good wealth and everything he desires. Therefore the sdstras advise,
yajfiaifi sankirtana-prayair yajanti hi 50776010508 (Bhag. 11.5.32). Every house-
holder, therefore, who is actually intelligent should introduce the sas2kirtana move-
ment home to home and live peacefully in this life and go back to Godhead in the
next.

“If you are miserly and do not give Me the offerings, every one of you will have

PURPORT
In tndia in those days and even until fifty years ago, polygamy was freely allowed.
Any man, especially of the higher castes—the brahmanas, the vaisyas and particular-


--- Page 164 ---
Text 60] Lord Caitanya’s Childhood Pastimes 163
ly the ksutriyas— could marry more than one wife. In the Mahabhdrata, or the old
history of India, we see that ksatriya kings especially used to marry many wives.
According to Vedic civilization there was no restriction against this, and even a man
more than fifty years old could marry. But to be married to a man who had many
wives was not a very pleasing situation because the husband’s love would be divided
among his many wives. Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu apparently wanted to curse
the girls unwilling to offer Him the naivedya to be married to men who had at least
four wives.

The social structure allowing a man to marry more than one wife can be supported
in this way. Generally in every society the female population is greater in number
than the male population. Therefore if it is a principle in the society that all girls
should be married, unless polygamy is allowed it will not be possible. If all the girls
are not married there is a good chance of adultery, and a society in which adultery
is allowed cannot be very peaceful or pure. In our Krsna consciousness society we
have restricted illicit sex life. The practical difficulty is to find a husband for each
and every girl. We are therefore in favor of polygamy, provided, of course, that the
husband is able to maintain more than one wife.

“Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. | shall deliver you from
all sinful reaction. Do not fear.” (Bg. 18.66) People do not understand this. They
are accustomed to flatter or worship many demigods, human beings, or even cats and
dogs, but when requested to worship the Supreme Lord, they refuse. This is called
illusion. Factually, if one worships the Supreme Lord there is no need to worship
anyone else. For example, in a village of a limited area one may use different wells
for different purposes, but when one goes to a river where there is water constantly
flowing in waves, that water can serve all his purposes. When there is a river, one can
take drinking water, wash his clothes, bathe and so on, for that water will serve all
purposes. Similarly, if one worships the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, all
his goals will be served. Kamais tais tair hrta-jfianaf prapadyante ‘nya-devatah: only
men who have lost their intelligence worship the various demigods to fulfill their
desires (Bg. 7.20).

168 Sif Caitanya-caritamrta [Adi-Iita, Ch. 14
TRANSLATION
Being worshiped by Laksmi, the Lord began to smile. He recited a verse from
$rimad-Bhagavatam and thus accepted the emotion she expressed.
PURPORT
The verse quoted in this connection is the twenty-fifth verse of the Twenty-
second Chapter, Tenth Canto, of Srimad-Bhagavatam. The gopis worshiped the
goddess Durga, or Katyayani, but their inner desire was to get Lord Kgsna as their
husband. Krsna, as Paramatma, could realize the ardent desire of the gopis, and
therefore He enjoyed the pastime of vastra-harapa. When the gopis went to take
bath in the River Yamuna, they left their garments on the land and dipped into the
water completely naked. Taking this opportunity, Krsna stole all their garments
and sat down in the top of a tree with them, desiring to see the girls naked just to
become their husband. The 40275 desired to have Krsna as their husband, and since
itis only before her husband that a woman can be naked, to fulfill their desire Lord
Krsna accepted their prayers by this pastime of stealing their garments. When the
075 received their garments back from Krsna, Krsna recited this verse.

“‘My dear gopis, | accept your desire to have Me as your husband and thus worship
Me. | wish your desire to be fulfilled because it deserves to be so.”
PURPORT
The gopis, the girl friends of Krsna, were almost of the same age as He. Within
their minds they desired that Krsna be their husband, but because of feminine bash-
fulness they could not express their desire. Therefore later on, after stealing their

garments, Krsna informed them, "^| immediately understood your desire and approved
of it. Because | have now stolen your garments, you have presented yourselves be-
fore Me completely naked, which means that | have accepted all of you as My
wives.” Sometimes foolish rascals, not knowing the purpose of the Lord or the
purpose of the 4275, unnecessarily criticize from their own angle of vision, but the
real purpose of vastra-harana is expressed by the Lord in this verse.

and cook food in new pots. This system is still going on in Jagannatha Puri. The
foodstuffs would be cooked in earthen pots, all fresh and new, and after cooking,
the pots would be thrown away. By the side of the house there was generally a big
pit where such pots were thrown. Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu sat down on the pots
very pleasingly, just to give His mother a lesson.

said, ‘Mother, that this is pure and that is impure is surely a worldly sentiment
with no basis in fact. You have cooked foodstuffs for Lord Vispu within these pots
and offered the foodstuffs to Him. How then can these pots be untouchable?
Everything in relationship with Visnu is to be considered an expansion of Visnu's

The twelve phala, or combinations of letters, are called repha, murdhanya

primary educational beginning. At the age of four or five years, on an auspicious
day called vidyarambha marking the beginning of primary education, there is a
ceremony worshiping Lord Visnu, and after that the teacher gives the child a long
chalk pencil. Then, guiding the hand of the student, he instructs him how to write
the letters of the alphabet (०, g, /, etc.) by writing big letters on the floor. When the
child is a little advanced in writing, he is given a slate for his primary education,
which ends when he learns the two-letter combinations, which are called pha/a, as
mentioned above.

Chapter 15
The Lord’s Pauganda-lila
A synopsis of the Fifteenth Chapter is as follows. The Lord took lessons in
grammar from Gangadasa Pandita and became very expert in commenting upon
grammar. He forbade His mother to take grains on the Ekadasi day. He narrated a
story that Visvarupa, after accepting the sannyasa order, invited Him in a dream to
accept sannyasa also, but the Lord refused and was therefore sent back home. When
fagannatha Misra passed away, the Lord married the daughter of Vallabhacarya,
whose name was Laksmi. All these events are summarized in this chapter.

TRANSLATION
When the Lord was studying grammar at the place of Gangadasa Papgita, He
would immediately learn grammatical rules and definitions by heart simply by
hearing them once.
PURPORT
Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura says that the Lord was given lessons by a teacher
named Vispu and another teacher named Sudarsana. Later on, when He was a little
grown up, He was under the care of Gangadasa Pandita, who taught Him grammar
of a higher standard. Anyone serious about studying the Sanskrit language should
first learn grammar. It is said that simply to finish studying Sanskrit grammar
takes at least twelve years, but once one learns the grammatical rules and regula-
tions very nicely, all other scriptures or subject matters in Sanskrit are extremely
easy to understand, for Sanskrit grammar is the gateway to education,

TRANSLATION
His mother replied, “My dear son, | will give You whatever You ask.” Then the
Lord said, “My dear mother, please do not eat grains on the Ekadasi day.”
PURPORT
From the very beginning of His childhood life Si Caitanya Mahaprabhu intro-
duced the system of observing a fast on the Ekadasi day. In the Bhakti-sandarbha
by Srila Jiva GosvamT there is a quotation from the Skanda Purana admonishing
that a person who eats grains on Ekadasi becomes a murderer of his mother, father,
brother and spiritual master, and even if he is elevated to a Vaikuntha planet, he
falls down. On Ekadast, everything is cooked for Visnu, including regular grains and
dahi, but it is enjoined that a Vaisnava should not even take vispu-prasada on
Ekadasi. It is said that a Vaisnava does not accept anything eatable that is not
offered to Lord Visnu, but on Ekada$i a Vaisnava should not touch even maha-
prasada offered to Visnu, although such prasdda may be kept for being eaten the
next day. It is strictly forbidden for one to accept any kind of grain on Ekadasi,
even if it is offered to Lord Visnu.

TRANSLATION
Mother Saci said: “You have spoken very nicely. [ shall not eat grains on
Ekadasi.”” From that day, she began to observe fasting on Ekadasi.
PURPORT
It is a prejudice amongst smdrta-brahmanas that a widow must observe fasting on
Ekadasi but a woman who, has her husband should not. It appears that before the
request of Lord Caitanya Sacimata was not observing Ekadasi because of her being
sa-dhava, which means that her husband was living. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu,
however, introduced the system that a woman, even if not a widow, must observe
the Ekadasi day and must not touch any kind of grains, even those offered to the
Deity of ৮1500.

renounced order of life; karila—has accepted; pitr-kufa—father’s family; matr-kula—
mother's family; dui—both of them; uddhdrila—delivered.


--- Page 190 ---
190 ও Caitanya-caritamrta [Adi-lila, Ch. 15
TRANSLATION

“My dear mother and father,” the Lord said, "it is very good that Vidvariipa has
accepted the sannyasa order, for thus He has delivered both His father’s family and
His mother’s family.”

PURPORT
It is sometimes said that Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu did not approve of the
acceptance of the sannydsa order in this Kali-yuga because in the astra it is said:
asvamedharn gavalambharh sannydsar pala-paitrkam
devarena sutotpattirm kalau panca vivarjayet
“In this Kali-yuga the performance of the a$vamedha-yajiia or gomedha-yajiia,
sacrifices in which a horse or cow is offered, should be avoided, as should the
acceptance of sannydsa, the renounced order of life.” {Brahma-vaivarta Purana,
Krsna-janma-khapgda 185.180)

Nevertheless we see that Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu Himself accepted sannydsa and
approved of the sannyasa of His elder brother, Visvarapa. It is clearly said here,
bhala haila, —viSvaripa sannyasa karila pitr-kula, matr-kula,—dui uddhdrila. There-
fore, should it be thought that Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu made statements that are
contradictory? No, actually He did not. It is recommended that one accept sannyasa
to dedicate his life for the service of the Lord, and everyone must take that kind of
sannyasa, for by accepting such sannydsa one renders the best service to both his
paternal and maternal families. But one should not accept the sannydsa order of the
Mayavada school, which has practically no meaning. We find many Mayavadi
sannydsis simply loitering in the street thinking themseives Brahman or Narayana
and spending all day and night begging so they can fill their hungry bellies.
Mayavadi sannydsis have become so degraded that there is a section of them who
eat everything, just like hogs and dogs. It is such degraded sannydsa that is pro-
hibited in this age. Actually, Srila Sankaracarya's principles for the acceptance of
sannydsa were very strict, but later the so-called Mayavadi sannydsis became de-
graded because of their false philosophy, which propounds that by accepting
sannydsa one becomes Narayana. Siri Caitanya Mahaprabhu rejected that kind of
sannydsa. But the acceptance of sannydsa is one of the items of the varpasramao-
dharma. How then can it be rejected?

Rhaijya—after eating; bhimite—on the ground; padila—fell; prabhu—the Lord;

TRANSLATION
One day Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu ate betel nuts offered to the Deity, but they
acted as an intoxicant, and He fell down on the ground unconscious.
PURPORT
Bete! nuts are an intoxicant, and therefore the regulative principles prohibit
eating them. Sri Caitanya Mahzaprabhu’s pastime of fainting after eating betel nuts
is a solid instruction to all of us that one should not touch betel nuts, even those
offered to Vispu, just as one should not touch grains on the Ekadasi day. Of course,
Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s fainting had a particular purpose. As the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, He can do whatever He likes and eat whatever He wants,
but we should not imitate His pastimes.

Chapter 16
The Pastimes of the Lord
in His Childhood and Youth
This chapter fully describes Lord Caitanya’s kaisora-/ild, or the activities He
performed just before attaining youth. During this time He studied deeply and was
victorious over greatly learned scholars. During His kaisora-/i/d the Lord also sported
in the water. He went to East Bengal to secure financial assistance, cultivate knowl-
edge and introduce the sankirtana movement, and there He met Tapana Misra,
whom He instructed about spiritual advancement and ordered to go to Varanasi.
While Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu was touring East Bengal, His wife, Laksmidevi,
was bitten by a serpent or by the serpent of separation, and thus she left this
world. When the Lord returned home, He saw that His mother was overwhelmed
with grief because of Laksmidevi’'s death. Therefore at her request He later married
His second wife, Visnupriya-devi. This chapter also describes the Lord's argument
with Kesava Kasmiri, the celebrated scholar, and the Lord's criticism of his prayer
glorifying mother Ganges. In this prayer the Lord found five kinds of literary orna-
ments and five kinds of literary faults, thus defeating the papdita. Later the Kasmiri
Pandita, who was known to have been victorious all over the country, submitted
himself to the goddess of learning, and by her order he met Lord Caitanya
Mahaprabhu on the morning of the next day and surrendered unto Him.

202 Srv Caitanya-caritamrta [Adi-ila, Ch. 16
PURPORT
Narottama dasa Thakura has sung, $ri-kfspa-caitanya prabhu daya kara more. He
prays for Lord Caitanya’s mercy because He is the mercy incarnation, having ap-
peared especially to claim the fallen souls. The more fallen one is, the greater one’s
claim to the favor of Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. One must only be very sincere
and serious. Despite being contaminated by all the bad qualities of this Kali-yuga,
if one surrenders unto the lotus feet of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, the Lord will
surely and certainly deliver him. The best example is Jagai and Madhai. In this age
of Kali practically everyone is like agai and Madhai, but the saikirtana movement
inaugurated by Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu is still flowing like a great river, inundat-
ing the entire world, and thus the International Society for Krishna Consciousness
is successfully claiming all fallen souls to free them from contamination.

Although Lord Sri Caitanya Mahiaprabhu and His devotees in disciplic succession
can defeat all kinds of learned scholars, scientists and philosophers in arguments,
thus establishing the supremacy of the Personality of Godhead, their main business
as preachers is to introduce sankirtana everywhere. Simply to defeat scholars and
philosophers is not the occupation of a preacher. Preachers must simultaneously
introduce the sasikirtana movement, for that is the mission of the Caitanya cuit.

TRANSLATION

in East Bengal there was a brahmana named Tapana Misra who could not ascertain

the objective of life nor how to attain it.
PURPORT

One must first ascertain the object of life and then understand how to attain it.
The Krsna consciousness movement is pointing out to everyone that the object of
life is to understand Krsna, and to attain that goal of life one must practice Krsna
consciousness, following the methods prescribed by the Gosvamis with reference to
the authoritative s@stras and Vedas.

persons; citte—within the heart; bhrama—doubt; haya—there is; sadhya-sadhana—
objective and means; $restha—about the best; nd—not; haya—there 15; niscaya—
certainty.

TRANSLATION

If one becomes a bookworm, reading many books and scriptures and hearing
many commentaries and the instructions of many men, this will produce doubt
within his heart. One cannot in this way ascertain the real goal of life.

PURPORT

In Srimad-Bhagavatam (7.13.8) it is said, granthdan naivibhyased bahan na
vyakhyam upayufjita: “One should not read many books, nor should one try to
make a profession of reciting many books, especially if one is a devotee.'' One must
give up the ambition to be a learned scholar and in this way earn a worldly reputa-
tion and financial facilities. If one diverts his attention to studying many books, he
cannot fix his mind in devotional service, nor can he understand many scriptures,
for they are full of grave statements and meanings. In this connection Srila
Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura gives his opinion that those who are attracted
to studying many kinds of literature concerning various subject matters, especially
fruitive activities and philosophical speculation, are deprived of unalloyed devotional
service because of their splayed attention.

Man has a general tendency toward fruitive activities, religious ritualistic cere-
monies and philosophical speculation. A living entity thus bewildered since time
immemorial does not understand the real goal of life, and thus his activities in life


--- Page 208 ---
Text 14] Pastimes of Childhood and Youth 207
are wasted. innocent persons misled in this way are deprived of unalloyed krsna-
bhakti, devotional service to the Lord. Tapana Misra is a vivid example of such a
person. He was a learned scholar, but he could not ascertain what the goal of life is.
Therefore he was given a chance to hear Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu instructing
Sanatana Gosvami. Lord Caitanya’s instruction to Tapana Misra is especially signifi-
cant for persons who loiter here and there coliecting books and reading none of
them, thus becoming bewildered regarding the aim of life.

TRANSLATION
The Lord, being satisfied, instructed him about the object of life and the process
to attain it. He instructed him that the basic principle of success is to chant the
holy name of the Lord [the Hare Krsna maha-mantra].
PURPORT
The Krsna consciousness movement is based upon this instruction of Lord
Caitanya Mahaprabhu that one must chant the Hare 10503 mahd-mantra regularly
and according to the prescribed principles. We simply ask our western students to
chant at least sixteen rounds a day, but sometimes we find that they fail to chant
even these sixteen rounds, and instead they bring many austere books and a worship-
ing method that diverts their attention in so many ways. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu's
cult is based upon the chanting of the Hare Krsna mantra. Lord Caitanya first
advised Tapana Misra to fix his mind in this chanting. We, the members of the
Krsna consciousness movement, must strictly follow this advice of Caitanya
Mahaprabhu.

I cannot understand the inconceivable pastimes of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu,
for although Tapana Misra wanted to live with Him in Navadvipa, the Lord advised
him to go to Varanasi.
PURPORT
When Tapana Miéra met Caitanya Mahaprabhu, Lord Caitanyawas living in house-
hold life, and there was no indication that in the future He would accept the
sannydsa order. But by asking Tapana Misra to go to Varanasi He indicated that in
the future He would accept sannydsa and that when He would teach Sanatana
Gosvami, Tapana Misra would take advantage of the opportunity to learn the
object of life and the real process of attaining it.

It is stated in Bhagavad-gita:
dehino 'smin yathd dehe
kaumdrarh yauvanari jar@
10100 dehantara-praptir
dhiras tatra na muhyati
“As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to
old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. The self-realized soul
is not bewildered by such a change.” (৪8. 2.13) Such verses from Bhagavad-gita or
any other Vedic literature give valuable instructions on the occasion of someone’s
passing away. By discussing such instructions from Bhagavad-gitd or Srimad-
Bhagavatam a sober man can certainly understand that the soul never dies; it passes
from one body to another. This is called transmigration of the soul. A soul comes
into this material world and creates bodily relationships with a father, a mother,
sisters, brothers, a wife and children, but all these relationships pertain to the body,
not the soul. Therefore, as described in Bhagavad-gita, dhiras tatra na muhyati: one
who is sober is not disturbed by such phenomenal changes within this material
world. Such instructions are called tattva-kathd, or real truth,

TRANSLATION

Then Lord Caitanya married Visnupriya, the goddess of fortune, and thereafter

He conquered a champion of learning named Kesava Kasmiri.
PURPORT

As in the modern day there are many champions in sports, so in bygone days
there were many learned scholars in India who were champions in learning. One
such person was Kesava Kasmiri, who came from the state of Kashmir. He traveled
all over India and at last came to Navadvipa to challenge the learned scholars there.
Unfortunately he could not conquer the learned scholars in Navadvipa, for he was
defeated by the boy scholar Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Later he understood that
Caitanya Mahaprabhu is none other than the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Thus he surrendered unto Him and later became a pure Vaisnava in the sampradaya
of Nimbarka. He wrote Kaustubha-prabhd, a commentary on the Vedanta commen-
tary of the Nimbarka-sampradaya, which is known as the Parifata-bhasya.

The Bhakti-ratngkara mentions Kesava Kasmiri and lists his predecessors in the
disciplic succession of the Nimbarka-sampradaya: (1) Srinivasa Acarya, (2) Visva
Acarya, (3) Purusottama, (4) Vilasa, (5) 5५27003, (6) Madhava, (7) Balabhadra,
(8) Padma, (9) Syama, (10) Gopala, (11) Krpa, (12) Deva Acarya, (13) Sundara
Bhatta, (14) Padmanabha, (15) Upendra, (16) Ramacandra, (17) Vamana, (18) Krsna,
(19) Padmakara, (20) Sravana, (21) Bhuri, (22) Madhava, (23) Syama, (24) Gopila,
(25) Balabhadra, (26) Gopinatha, (27) Kesava, (28) Gokuta and (29) Kesava Kasmiri.
It is stated in the Bhakti-ratnGkara that Kesava Kasmiri was a favorite devotee of
mother Sarasvati, the goddess of learning. By her grace he was an extremely influen-
tial scholar, and he was the greatest champion among all the scholars in the four
corners of the country. Therefore he got the title digvifay’, which means ‘one who
has conquered everyone in all directions.” He belonged to a very respectable
brahmana family of Kashmir. Later, by the order of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, he
gave up the profession of winning championships and became a great devotee. He
joined the Nimbarka-sampradaya, one of the Vaisnava communities of the Vedic
culture.

Formerly Sanskrit schools first taught grammar very thoroughly, and this system
continues even now. A student was supposed to study grammar carefully for twelve
years in the beginning of his life, because if one is expert in the grammar of the
Sanskrit language, all the $@stras are open to him. € Caitanya Mahaprabhu was
famous for teaching grammar to students, and therefore Kesava Kasmiri first re-
ferred to His position as a teacher of grammar. He was very proud of his literary
career; he was far above the first lessons of grammar, and so he thought the position
of Nimdi Pandita not at all comparable to his own.

There are many schools of grammar in the Sanskrit language, the most famous
of which are the systems of Panini and the Kalapa and Kaumudi grammars. There

218 Si Caitanya-caritamrta [Adi-lila, Ch. 16
were different branches of grammatical knowledge, and a student of grammar was
supposed to study them 2| in twelve years. Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who was famous
as Nimai Pandita, taught grammar to His students, who became expert in deating
with the word jugglery of complicated grammar. Almost anyone expert in studying
grammar interprets the Sgstras in many ways by changing the root meanings of
their words. A student of grammar can sometimes completely change the meaning
of a sentence by juggling grammatical rules. Kesava Kasmiri indirectly taunted Lord
Caitanya Mahaprabhu by implying that although He was a great teacher of grammar,
such grammatical jugglery of root meanings did not require great expertise. This
was a challenge to Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Because it was prearranged that
Kesava Kasmiri would have to discuss the sastras with Nimai Pandita, from the
very beginning he wanted to bluff the Lord. Thus the Lord replied as follows.

Since Ke$ava Kasmiri was a little puffed-up, the Lord increased his artificial
pride by presenting Himself as subordinate to him. Thus He flattered him as
follows.

“Your poetry is so difficult that no one can understand it but you and mother

Replying to Kesava Kasmiri sarcastically, Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu indirectly
minimized the value of his poetry by saying, 165, your compositions are so nice
that no one but you and your worshipable mother, the goddess of learning, can
understand them.” Kesava Kasmiri was a favorite devotee of mother Sarasvati, the
goddess of learning, but Caitanya Mahiprabhu, as the master of the goddess of
learning, has the right to speak sarcastically of her devotees. In other words, al-
though Kesava Kasmiri was proud of being favored by the goddess of learning,
he did not know that she is controlled by Caitanya Mahaprabhu Himself because
He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

tion; tumi—you; kavi-vara—the most elevated poet; aiche—similarly; devera—of the

TRANSLATION
The Lord replied: “By the grace of the Lord someone may become a great poet,
and similarly by His grace someone else may become a great srutidhara who can
memorize anything immediately.”
PURPORT
In this connection, $rutidhara is a very important word. $ruti means “hearing,”
and dhara means 016 who can capture.” Formerly, before the beginning of Kali-
yuga, almost everyone, especially among the intelligent men, the br@dhmanpas, was a
Srutidhara. As soon as a student heard any of the Vedic wisdom from his master,
he would remember it forever. There was no need to refer to books, and therefore
there were no written books in those days. The spiritual master delivered the Vedic
hymns and their explanations to the student, who would then remember them for-
ever, without consulting books.
To become a srutidhara, one who can remember simply by hearing, is a great
achievement for a student. In 8hagavad-gita the Lord says:
yad yad vibhatimat sattvarmn
$rimad arjitam eva va


--- Page 225 ---
224 $i Caitanya-caritamrta [Adi-lila, Ch. 16
tat tad evdvagaccha tvarh
mama tejo 'rhsa-sambhavam
“Know that all beautiful, glorious and mighty creations spring from but a spark of
My splendor.” (৪8. 10.41)

As soon as we find anything extraordinary, we should understand that such an
extraordinary manifestation is the special grace of the Supreme Personality of God-
head. Therefore Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu replied to the champion, Kesava
Kasmiri, that just as he was greatly proud of being a favorite devotee of mother
Sarasvati, so someone eise, like He Himself, being favored by the Supreme Person-
ality of Godhead, could become a srutidhara and thus memorize anything immedi-
ately simply by hearing it.

Satisfied by the statement of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu, the brahmana [Kesava
Kasmiri] explained the quoted verse. Then the Lord said: “Now kindly explain the
special qualities and faults in the verse.”

PURPORT

Not only did Sri Caitanya Mahiprabhu pick out this one among the one hundred
verses and remember it although the bréhmapa had recited them like the blowing
wind, but He also analyzed its qualities and faults. Not only did He hear the verse,
but He immediately made a critical study of it.

TRANSLATION
The brahmana replied: “There is not a tinge of fault in that verse. Rather, it has
the good qualities of similes and alliteration.”
PURPORT
In the last line of the verse quoted by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, the letter bha is
repeated many times, as in the words bhavani, bhartur, vibhavati and adbhuta. Such
repetition is calied anuprdsa, or alliteration. The words /aksmir iva and 45/70 carana-
karnalotpatti are instances of upamd-alarikdra, for they exhibit metaphorical beauty.
The Ganges is water,and Laksmi is the goddess of fortune. Since water and a person
are not actually similar, the comparison is metaphorical.

PURPORT
Kesava Kasmiri first wanted to bluff Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu by saying that
since He was not an advanced student in literary style, He could not review a verse
full of metaphors and literary ornaments. This argument has some basis in fact.
Unless one is a medical man one cannot criticize a medical man, and unless one is a
lawyer he cannot criticize a lawyer. Therefore Kesava Kasmiri first depreciated the
Lord’s position. Because Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu was to the champion a student
of grammar, how could He dare criticize a great poet like him? Lord Caitanya,
therefore, criticized the poet in a different way. He said that although He was cer-
tainly not advanced in a literary career, He had heard from others how to criticize
such poetry, and as a Srutidhara, possessing a complete memory, He could under-
stand the process for such a review.

“Certainly | have not studied the art of literary embellishments. But | have heard

and many good qualities.”
PURPORT
The statement Rariyachi sravana (| have heard it”) is very important in the sense
that hearing is more important than directly studying or perceiving. If one is expert
in hearing and hears from the right source, his knowledge is immediately perfect.
This process is called $rauta-panthd, or the acquirement of knowledge by hearing
from authorities. All Vedic knowledge is based on the principle that one must
approach a bona fide spiritual master and hear from the authoritative statements of
the Vedas. It is not necessary for one to be a highly polished literary man to receive
knowledge; to receive perfect knowledge from a perfect person, one must be expert
in hearing. This is called the descending process of deductive knowledge, or avaroha-
pantha,

Text 55) Pastimes of Childhood and Youth 229
TRANSLATION

“My dear sir, in this verse there are five faults and five literary ornaments. | shall

state them one after another. Kindly hear Me and then give your judgment.
PURPORT

In the verse beginning with mahattvarn gangayah there are five literary ornaments
and five examples of faulty composition. There are two examples of the fault called
avimysta-vidheyarisa and one example each of the faults viruddha-mati, punar-ukti
and bhagna-krama.

Vimysta means 06317,” and vidheyarhsa means ‘‘predicate.” 1६ is a general rule
of composition to establish a subject first and then give its predicate. For example,
according to Sanskrit grammar if one says, “This man is learned,’ his composition
is in order. But if one says, ‘‘Learned is this man,’ the composition is not in order.
Such a flaw is called avimysta-vidheydrh$a-doga, or the fault of unclean composition.
The subject matter to be known of the verse is the glorification of the Ganges, and
therefore the word idam (00151) or what is known should have been placed before
instead of after the glorification. The subject matter already known should be
placed before the unknown so that its meaning will not be misconstrued.

The second instance of avimysta-vidheyarnsa-dosa occurs in the words dvitiya-
srilaksmitr iva. In this composition the word dvitiya (“s¥cond”) is vidheya, or un-
known. Placing the unknown first to make the compound word dvitiya-srilaksmir
is another fault. The words dvitiya-srilaksmir iva were intended to compare the
Ganges to the goddess of fortune, but because of this fault the meaning of the com-
pound word was bewildering.

The third fault is that of viruddha-mati, or contradictory conception, in the
words bhavani-bhartuh. The word bhavant refers to the wife of Bhava, Lord Siva.
But since Bhavani is already known as the wife of Lord Siva, to add the word
bharta, ‘husband,’ thus forming a compound meaning ‘‘the husband of the wife of
Lord Siva,” is contradictory, for thus it appears as if the wife of Lord Siva had
another husband.

The fourth fault is punar-ukti, or redundancy, which occurs when the verb
vibhavati (“flourishes”), which should have ended the composition, is further quali-
fied by the unnecessary adjective adbhuta-guna (‘endowed with wonderful quali-
095). The fifth fault is bhagna-krama, which means ‘broken 01061.” In the first,
third and fourth lines there is anuprasa, or alliteration, created by the sounds tg, ra
and 6/0, but in the second line there is no such agnuprdsa, and therefore the order
is broken.

—of the Ganges; prakasa—emanation; shate—in this; virodha nahi—there is no con-

TRANSLATION
“In this birth of the Ganges, by the inconceivable potency of the Lord, there is
no contradiction although it appears contradictory.
PURPORT
The central point of all Vaisnava philosophy is to accept the inconceivable
potency of Lord Visnu. What sometimes appears contradictory from a material
viewpoint is understandable in connection with the Supreme Personality of God-
head because He can perform contradictory activities by dint of His inconceivable
potencies. Modern scientists are puzzled. They cannot even explain how such a
large quantity of chemicals has formed the atmosphere. Scientists explain that water
is a combination of hydrogen and oxygen, but when asked where such a large
quantity of hydrogen and oxygen came from and how they combined to manufac-
ture the great oceans and seas, they cannot answer because they are atheists who
will not accept that everything comes from life. Their thesis is that life comes from
matter.
Where do all these chemicals come from? The answer is that they are produced
by the inconceivable energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Living entities
are part of the Supreme Godhead, and from their bodies come many chemicals.


--- Page 242 ---
Text 82] Pastimes of Childhood and Youth 241
For example, the lemon tree is a living entity that produces many lemons, and within
each lemon is a great deal of citric acid. Therefore, if even an insignificant living
entity who is but a part of the Supreme Lord can produce so much of a chemical,
how much potency there must be in the body of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead.

Scientists cannot perfectly explain where the chemicals of the world are manu-
factured, but one can explain this perfectly by accepting the inconceivable energy
of the Supreme Lord. There is no reason for denying this argument. Since there
are potencies in the living entities who are samples of the Personality of Godhead,
how much potency there must be in the Supreme Godhead Himself. As described
in the Vedas, nityo nitydndri1 cetana$ cetandnam: ‘‘He is the chief eternal of all
eternals and the chief living entity among all living entities.” (Katha Upanisad,
2.2.13}

Unfortunately, atheistic science will not accept that matter comes from life.
Scientists insist upon their most illogical and foolish theory that life comes from
matter, although this is quite impossible. They cannot prove in their laboratories
that matter can produce life, yet there are thousands and thousands of examples
illustrating that matter comes from life. Therefore in $/7 Caitanya-caritamyta
Krsnadasa Kavirija Gosvami says that as soon as one accepts the inconceivable
potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, no great philosopher or scientist
can put forward any thesis to contradict the Lord’s power. This is expressed in the
following Sanskrit verse.

water; mura-bhidi—in the killer of Murasura (Krsna); tat-viparitam—just the opposite
of that; pada-embhojat—from the lotus flower of His feet; mahd-nadi—the great
river; jatd—has grown.

TRANSLATION

“Everyone knows that lotus flowers grow in the water but water never grows
from a lotus. All such contradictions, however, are wonderfully possible in Krsna.
The great River Ganges has grown from His lotus feet.

PURPORT
In Bhagavad-gita it is clearly said that all intelligence comes from the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, who is situated in everyone's heart as Paramatma. The
Paramatma gave the papdita the intelligence to understand that because he was
proud of his learning and wanted to defeat even the Supreme Lord, by the will of
the Lord and through the agency of mother Sarasvati he had been defeated. One
should not, therefore, be too proud of one’s position. Even if one is a greatly
learned scholar, if he commits an offense to the lotus feet of the Lord he will not

Text 92] Pastimes of Childhood and Youth 245
be able to speak properly, in spite of his learning. In every respect, we are con-
trolled. Our only duty, therefore, is to surrender always to the lotus feet of the
Lord and not be falsely proud. Mother Sarasvati created this situation to favor the
champion 20001/19 so that he might surrender unto Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu.

“In explaining the glories of the Lord, inexperienced men may compose poetry
with many faults, but because it contains glorification of the Lord, great personali-
ties read it, hear it and chant it." (Bhdg. 1.5.11) Despite its minute literary discrepan-
cies, one must study poetry on the merit of its subject matter. According to Vaispava
philosophy, any literature that glorifies the Lord, whether properly written or not,
is first class. There need be no other considerations. The poetic compositions of
Bhavabhiti, or গা Kantha, include Mdiati-madhava, Uttara-carita, Vira-carita and
many other similar Sanskrit dramas. This great poet was born during the time of
Bhojaraja as the son of Nilakantha, a braAmana. Kalidasa flourished during the time
of Maharaja Vikramaditya, and he became the state poet. He composed some thirty
or forty Sanskrit dramas, including Kumdra-sambhava, Abhijngna-sakuntala and
Megha-data. His drama Raghu-varisa is especially famous. We have already described
Jayadeva in Chapter Thirteen of this Adi-/ila.

The same process advocated by Lord Sri Krsna in His teachings of Bhagavad-gita
as it is— ‘Surrender unto Me in all instances’’—~was advocated by Lord Caitanya
Mahaprabhu. The champion surrendered unto the Lord, and the Lord favored him.
One who is favored by the Lord is freed from material bondage, as stated in
Bhagavad-gitd (21/01 016/30/7 punar janma naiti mam etl so ‘rjuna).

TRANSLATION
The poetic champion was certainly most fortunate. His life was successful by
dint of his vast learning and erudite scholarship, and thus he attained the shelter of
Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu.
PURPORT
Sri Narottama dasa Thakura has sung that the best qualification for taking shelter
of the lotus feet of Lord Caitanya is to be the most fallen because the Lord came
specifically to deliver the fallen souls. In this age there are very few scholars. Almost
everyone is a fallen meat-eater, drunkard, woman-hunter or gambler. Such persons
are never considered learned scholars, even if they pose as such. Because these so-
called scholars superficially see that Caitanya Mahaprabhu associates with the
fallen souls, they think that He is meant for a lower class of men but that they do
not need Him. Thus such scholars do not take to the Kgsna consciousness move-
ment. To be puffed-up with false learning, therefore, is a disqualification for accept-
ing the Krsna consciousness movement. But here is a special example, for although
the poetic champion was a greatly learned scholar, the Lord also favored him be-
cause of his humble submission.

Chapter 17
The Pastimes
of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu in His Youth

This Seventeenth Chapter, as summarized by Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura in his
Amyta-pravaha-bhdsya, describes Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu's pastimes from His
sixteenth year until the time He accepted the renounced order of life. Srila
Vrndavana dasa Thakura has already vividly described these pastimes in the
Caitanya-bhdgavata. Therefore Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami describes them only
briefly. Vivid descriptions of some portions of His pastimes are seen in this chapter,
however, because Vrndavana dasa Thakura has not elaborately described them.

In this chapter we shall find descriptions of the mango distribution festival and
Lord Caitanya’s discourses with Chand Kazi. Finally, the chapter shows that the
same son of mother Yasoda, Lord Krsna, tasted four transcendental mellows of
devotional service in His form of Sacinandana, the son of mother 930. To under-
stand Srimati’ Radharani's ecstatic love for Him, Lord Sri Krsna assumed the form
of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu. The attitude of Srimati Radharani is considered the
superexcellent devotional mentality. As Caitanya Mahaprabhu, Krsna Himself
assumed the position of Srimati Radharagi to taste Her ecstatic situation. No one
else could do this.

When Sri Krsna assumed the form of the four-armed Narayana, the gop7s showed
their respect, but they were not very much interested in Him. In the ecstatic love of
the gopis, all worshipable forms but Krsna are rejected. Among all the gop’s,
Srimati Radharani has the highest ecstatic love. When Krsna in His form of Narayana
saw Radharani, He could not keep His position as Narayana, and again He assumed
the form of Krsna.

The King of Vrajabhami is Nanda Maharaja, and the same person in Navadvipa
is Jagannatha Misra, the father of Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Similarly, mother Yasoda
is the Queen of Vrajabhomi, and in the pastimes of Lord Caitanya she is Sacimata.
Therefore the son of SacT is the son of Yasoda. Sri Nityananda occupies an ecstatic
position of parental love in servitude and fraternal attraction. Sri Advaita Prabhu
exhibits the ecstasy of both fraternity and servitude. All the Lord's other associates,
situated in their original love, engage in the service of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu.

The same Absolute Truth who enjoys as Kysna, Syamasundara, who plays His
flute and dances with the (0/5, sometimes takes birth in a 85/30/7৫00 family and
plays the part of & Caitanya Mahaprabhu, accepting the renounced order of life.
it appears contradictory that the same ।< [$> accepted the ecstasy of the gopris,
and of course this is very difficult for an ordinary person to understand. But if
we accept the inconceivable energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we can
understand that everything is possible. There is no need of mundane arguments in
this connection because mundane arguments are meaningless arguments in
regard to inconceivable potency.

256 11 Caitanya-caritamrta [Adi.lita, Ch. 17

In the end of this Seventeenth Chapter Srila Krspadasa Kaviraja Gosvami,
following in the footsteps of Srila Vyasadeva, has analyzed all the Ad/-/i/a pastimes
separately.

vande—let me offer my obeisances; svaira—completely independent; adbhuta—
and uncommon; iham—whose activities; tam—unto Him; caitanyam—Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu; yat—of whom; prasédatafi—by the mercy; yavanafi—even the unclean;
sumandyante—are transformed into gentlemen; kssna-nama—of the holy name of
Lord Krsna; prajalpak@h—taking to the chanting.

TRANSLATION

Let me offer my respectful! obeisances to (1 Caitanya Mahaprabhu, by whose
mercy even unclean yavanas become perfectly well-bred gentlemen by chanting the
holy name of the Lord. Such is the power of Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.

PURPORT

There is a persistent misunderstanding between caste brdhmanas and advanced
Vaisnavas or gosvamis because caste brahmanas, or smartas, are of the opinion that
one cannot become a brahmana unless he changes his body. As we have discussed
several times, itis to be understood that by the supremely powerful potency of the
Lord, as described by Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami, everything is possible. Caitanya
Mahaprabhu is as fully independent as Krsna. Therefore no one can interfere with
His activities. If He wants, by His mercy He can convert even a yavana, an unclean
follower of non-Vedic principles, into a perfectly well-behaved gentleman. This is
actually happening in our propagation of the Krsna consciousness movement, The
members of the present Krsna consciousness movement were not born in India, nor
do they belong to the Vedic culture, but within the short time of four or five years
they have become such wonderful devotees, simply by chanting the Hare Krsna
mantra, that even in India they are well received as perfectly well-behaved Vaisnavas
wherever they go.

Although less intelligent men cannot understand it, this is the special power of
Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Actually, the body of a Krsna conscious person


--- Page 258 ---
Text 3} Pastimes of the Lord in His Youth 257
changes in many ways. Even in the United States, when our devotees chant on the
street, American ladies and gentlemen inquire from them whether they are actually
Americans because no one could expect Americans to become such nice devotees
all of a sudden. Even Christian priests are greatly surprised that all these boys from
Jewish and Christian families have joined this Krsna consciousness movement;
before joining, they never regarded any principles of religion seriously, but now
they have become sincere devotees of the Lord. Everywhere people express this
astonishment, and we take great pride in the transcendental behavior of our
students. Such wonders are possible, however, only by the mercy of Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu. They are not ordinary or mundane.

TRANSLATION
In His youth, the Lord, on the plea of disturbances of the bodily airs, exhibited
His ecstatic love of Krsna. Accompanied by His confidential devotees, He enjoyed
various pastimes in this way.
PURPORT
According to Ayur-vedic treatment, the entire physiological system is conducted
by three elements, namely, vayu, pitta and kapha (air, bile and mucus). Secretions
within the body transform into other secretions like blood, urine and stool, but if
there are disturbances in the metabolism, the secretions turn into kapha (mucus)
by the influence of the air within the body. According to the Ayur-vedic system,
when the secretion of bile and formation of mucus disturb the air circulating within
the body, fifty-nine varieties of disease may occur. One of such diseases is craziness.
On the plea of disturbance of the bodily air and metabolism, Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu acted as if crazy. Thus in His school He began to explain the grammar
of verbs through Krsna consciousness. Explaining everything in grammar in
relationship to Krsna, the Lord induced His students to refrain from worldly
education, for it is better to become Krsna conscious and in this way attain the


--- Page 261 ---
260 ডা Caitanya-caritamrta [Adidila, Ch. 17
highest perfectional platform of education. On these grounds, Sri Jiva Gosvami
later compiled the grammar entitled Hari-namamgta-vyakarapa. People in general
consider such explanations crazy. Therefore the Lord’s purpose in His attitude of
craziness was to explain nothing within our experience but Krsna consciousness, for
everything may be dovetailed with Krsna consciousness. These pastimes of Lord
Caitanya Mahaprabhu have been very vividly described in the Caitanya-bhagavata,
Adi-khanda, Chapter Twelve.

TRANSLATION
Thereafter the Lord went to Gaya. There He met Srila Tsvara Puri.
PURPORT
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu went to Gaya to offer respectful oblations to His
forefathers. This process is called pirrda-dana. In Vedic society, after the death of a
relative, especially one’s father or mother, one must go to Gaya and there offer
oblations to the lotus feet of Lord Vispu. Therefore hundreds and thousands of
men gather in Gaya daily to offer such oblations, or sr@ddha. Following this
principle, Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu also went there to offer pinda to His dead
father. Fortunately He met Tsvara Puri there.

Text 10] Pastimes of the Lord in His Youth 261
TRANSLATION

In Gaya, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu was initiated by [5५२72 Puri, and immediately
afterwards He exhibited signs of love of Godhead. He again displayed such symptoms
after returning home.

PURPORT

When Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu went to Gaya, accompanied by many of His
disciples, He became sick on the way. He had such a high fever that He asked His
students to bring water that had washed the feet of brdhmanas, and when they
brought it the Lord drank it and was cured. Therefore everyone should respect the
position of a brahmana, as indicated by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Neither the Lord
nor His followers displayed any disrespect to bréhmanas.

The followers of the Lord must be prepared to offer brahmanas all due respect.
But preachers of Lord Caitanya’s cult object if someone presents himself as a
brahmapa without having the necessary qualifications. The followers of Lord
Caitanya cannot blindly accept that everyone born in a brdhmapa family is a
brahmana. Therefore one should not indiscriminately follow the Lord's example of
showing respect to brahmapas by drinking water that has washed their feet.
Gradually the brghmana families have become degraded because of the contamina-
tion of Kali-yuga. Thus they misguide people by exploiting their sentiments.

SYNONYMS

$acike—unto mother Sacidevi; prema-dana—giving love of Godhead; tabe—there-
after; advaita—with Advaita Acarya; milana—meeting; advaita—Advaita Acarya;
paila—received; visva-ripa— of the universal form of the Lord; darasana—vision.

TRANSLATION

Thereafter the Lord delivered love of Krsna to His mother, Sacidevi, nullifying
her offense at the feet of Advaita Acarya. Thus there was a meeting with Advaita
Acarya, who later had a vision of the Lord's universal form.

PURPORT

Oneday Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu was sitting on the throne of Visnu in the house
of Srivasa Prabhu, and in a mood of His own, He said, “My mother has offended
the lotus feet of Advaita Acarya. Unless she nullifies this offense at the lotus feet
of a Vaisnava, it will not be possible for her to achieve love of Krsna.’ Hearing this,


--- Page 263 ---
262 ऽत Caitanya-caritamrta [Adi-ila, Ch. 17
all the devotees went to bring Advaita Acirya there. While coming to see the Lord,
Advaita Acarya was glorifying the characteristics of mother Sactdevi, and thus upon
arriving He fell down on the ground in ecstasy. Then, under the instruction of
Lord Caitanya, Sacidevi took advantage of this situation to touch Advaita
Acarya’s lotus feet. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu was very much pleased by His
mother’s action, and He said, “Now My mother's offense at the lotus feet of
Advaita Acarya has been rectified, and she may have love of Krsna without
difficulty.” By this example Lord Caitanya taught everyone that although one may
be very much advanced in Krsna consciousness, if one offends the lotus feet of a
Vaisnava his advancement will not bear fruit. We should therefore be very much
conscious not to offend a Vaisnava. Caitanya-caritamcta has described such an
offense as follows:

vadi vaispava-aparadha uthe (077 mata

updde va chipgde, tara Sukhi’ ydya pata

(Cc. Madhya 19.156)

As a mad elephant may trample all the plants in a garden, so by committing one
offense at the lotus feet of a Vaisnava one may spoil all the devotional service he
has accumulated in his life.

After this incident, one day Advaita Acarya Prabhu requested Caitanya
Mahaprabhu to display the universal form He had very kindly shown Arjuna. Lord
Caitanya agreed to this 0700052}, and Advaita Prabhu was fortunate enough to see
the universal form of the Lord.

TRANSLATION

Srivasa Thakura then worshiped Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu by the process of

abhiseka. Sitting on a cot, the Lord exhibited transcendental opulence.
PURPORT

Abhigeka is a special function for the installation of the Deity. In this ceremony

the Deity is bathed with milk and water and then worshiped and given a change of

Text 13] Pastimes of the Lord in His Youth 263
dress. This abhiseka function was especially observed at the house of Srivisa. All the
devotees, according to their means, worshiped the Lord with all kinds of parapher-
nalia, and the Lord gave benedictions to each devotee according to his desire.

meeting; pgila—obtained; sat-bhuja-darsana—a vision of the six-armed Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu.

TRANSLATION

After this function at the house of Srivasa Thakura, Nityananda Prabhu appeared,
and when He met with Lord Caitanya He got the opportunity to see Him in His six-
armed form.

PURPORT

The form of sad-bhuja, the six-armed Lord Gaurasundara, is a representation of
three incarnations. The form of Sri Ramacandra is symbolized by a bow and arrow,
the form of Lord Sri Kysna is symbolized by a stick and flute like those generally
held by a cowherd boy, and Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu is symbolized by a
sannyasa-dapda and kamapdalu, or water pot.

Srila Nityananda Prabhu was born in the village of Ekacakra in the district of
Birbhum as the son of Padmavati and 13931 Pandita. In His childhood He played
like Balarama. When He was growing up, a sannydsi came to the house of Hadai
Pandita, begging to have the pandita’s son as his brahmacari assistant. Hadai
Pandita immediately agreed and delivered his son to him, although the separation
was greatly shocking, so much so that Hadai lost his life after the separation.
Nityananda Prabhu traveled on many pilgrimages with the sannydsi. It is said that
for many days He lived at Mathura with him, and at that time He heard about Lord
Caitanya Mahaprabhu's pastimes in Navadvipa. Therefore He came down to Bengal
to see the Lord. When Lord Nityananda came to Navadvipa, He was a guest at the
house of Nandana Acirya. Understanding that Nityananda Prabhu had arrived,
Lord Caitanya sent His devotees to Him, and thus there was a meeting between Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu and Nityananda Prabhu.

Finally the Lord showed Nityananda Prabhu His two-armed form of Krsna, the
son of Maharaja Nanda, simply playing on His flute, His bluish body dressed in yel-

ecstasy of becoming Nityananda; kaila—did; musala dhdrapa—carrying 2 plough-like

TRANSLATION
Nityananda Prabhu then arranged to offer Vyasa-piija, or worship of the spiritual
master, to Lord Sri Gaurasundara. But Lord Caitanya carried the plough-like weapon
called musala in the ecstasy of being Nityananda Prabhu.
PURPORT
By the order of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, Nityananda Prabhu arranged for Vyasa-
0013 of the Lord on the night of the full moon. He arranged for the Vyasa-pija, or
guru-paja, through the agency of Vyasadeva. Since Vyasadeva is the original guru
(spiritual master) of all who follow the Vedic principles, worship of the spiritual
master is called Vyasa-ptja. Nityananda Prabhu arranged for the Vyasa-pgja, and
sankirtana was going on, but when He tried to put a garland on the shoulder of Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu, He saw Himself in Lord Caitanya. There is no difference be-
tween the spiritual positions of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu and Nityananda Prabhu,
or Krsna and Balarama. All of them are but different manifestations of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. During this special ceremony, all the devotees of Lord
Caitanya Mahaprabhu could understand that there is no difference between Lord
Caitanya and Nityananda Prabhu.

SYNONYMS

tabe— thereafter; saci—mother Sacidevi; dekhila--saw; rama-krsna— Lord Krsna and
Lord Balarama; dui bhai—two brothers; tabe—thereafter; nistarila—delivered; prabhu

TRANSLATION

Thereafter mother Sacidevi saw the brothers Krsna and Balarama in Their mani-
festation of Lord Caitanya and Nityananda. Then the Lord delivered the two
brothers | 2221 and Madhai.

PURPORT

One night Sacidevi dreamt that the Deities in her house, Krsna and Balarama, had
taken the forms of Caitanya and Nityananda and were fighting one another, as
children do, to eat the naivedya, or offering to the Deities. On the next day, by the
will of Lord Caitanya, Sacidevi invited Nityananda to take prasdda at her house.
Thus Visvambhara {Lord Caitanya) and Nityananda were eating together, and
Sacidevi realized that They were none other than Kesna and Balarama. Seeing this,
she fainted.

] 3831 and Madhai were two brothers born in Navadvipa in a respectable bréhmana
family who later became addicted to all kinds of sinful activities. By the order of
Lord Caitanya, both Nityananda Prabhu and Haridasa Thakura used to preach the
cult of Kgsna consciousness door to door. In the course of such preaching they
found )agai and Madhai, two maddened drunken brothers, who, upon seeing them,
began to chase them. On the next day, Madhai struck Nityananda Prabhu on the
head with a piece of earthen pot, thus drawing blood. When Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu
heard of this, He immediately came to the spot, ready to punish both brothers, but
when the all-merciful Lord Gauranga saw Jagai's repentant behavior, He immediately
embraced him. By seeing the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face and em-
bracing Him, both the sinful brothers were at once cleansed. Thus they received
initiation into the chanting of the Hare Krsna mahdg-mantra from the Lord and
were delivered.

Lord; bhava-gvese—in ecstasy; yatha—anywhere; tathd—everywhere; bhakta-gapa—
the devotees; dekhila—saw; visese—specifically.
TRANSLATION

After this incident, the Lord remained in an ecstatic position for twenty-one

hours, and all the devotees saw His specific pastimes.
PURPORT

In the Deity’s room there must be a bed for the Deity behind the Deity's throne.
(This system should immediately be introduced in all our centers. It does not matter
whether the bed is big or small; it should be of a size the Deity room can conveniently
accommodate, but there must be at least a small bed.) One day in the house of
Srivasa Thakura, Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu sat down on the bed of Visnu,
and all the devotees worshiped Him with the Vedic mantras of the Purusa-sikta,
beginning with sahasra-$irsd purusah sahasraksab sahasra-pat. This veda-stuti
should also be introduced, if possible, for installations of Deities. While bathing
the Deity, all the priests and devotees must chant this Purusa-sikta and offer
the appropriate paraphernalia for worshiping the Deity, such as flowers, fruits,
incense, drgtrika paraphernalia, naivedya, vastra and ornaments. All the devotees
worshiped Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu in this way, and the Lord remained in ecsta-
sy for seven praharas, or twenty-one hours. He took this opportunity to show the
devotees that He is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, who is the
source of all other incarnations, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (ahari sarvasya
prabhavo mattah sarvarn pravartate). All the different forms of the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead, or visnu-tattva, emanate from the body of Lord Krsna. Lord
Caitanya Mahaprabhu exposed all the private desires of the devotees, and thus all of
them became fully confident that Lord Caitanya is the Supreme Personality of
Godhead.

Some devotees call this exhibition of ecstasy by the Lord sa@ta-prahariya bhava, or
“the ecstasy of twenty-one hours,” and others call it mahdbhava-prakasa or maha-
prakasa. There are other descriptions of this sG@ta-prahariya bhava in the Caitanya-
bhavagata, Chapter Nine, which mentions that Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu blessed a
maidservant named DuhkHi with the name Sukhi. He called for Sridhara, whose
name was Kholaveca Sridhara, and showed him His maha-prakasa. Then He called
for Murasi Gupta and showed him His feature as Lord Ramacandra. He offered His
blessings to Haridasa Thakura, and at this time He also asked Advaita Prabhu to ex-
plain Bhagavad-gita as it is {gitara satya: patha) and showed special favor to Mukunda.

TRANSLATION
One day Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu felt the ecstasy of the boar incarnation and got
up on the shoulders of Murari Gupta. Thus they both danced in Murari Gupta's
courtyard.
PURPORT
One day Caitanya Mahiaprabhu began to cry out, “Sakara! Stikara!”’ Thus crying
out for the boar incarnation of the Lord, He assumed His form as the boar incarna-
tion and got up on the shoulders of Murari Gupta. He carried a small gddu, a small
waterpot with a nozzle, and thus He symbolically picked up the earth from the
depths of the ocean, for this is the pastime of Lord Varaha.

After this incident the Lord ate raw rice given by Suklambara Brahmacari and ex-
plained very elaborately the import of the “harer nama’ sloka mentioned in the
Brhan-naradiya Purana:
PURPORT
र Suklambara Brahmacari resided in Navadvipa on the bank of the Ganges. When
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu was dancing in ecstasy, he approached the Lord with a
begging bag containing rice. The Lord was so pleased with His devotee that im-
mediately He snatched the bag and began to eat the raw rice. No one forbade Him,
and thus He finished the entire supply of rice.

TRANSLATION
This verse repeats the word eva [certainly] three times for emphasis, and it also
three times repeats harer nama [the holy name of the Lord] just to make common
people understand.
PURPORT
To emphasize something to an ordinary person, one may repeat it three times,
just as one might say, “You must do this! You must do this! You must do this!”
Thus the Brhan-naradiya Purana repeatedly emphasizes the chanting of the holy
name so that people may take it seriously and thus free themselves from the clutches
of maya. tt is our practical experience in the Krsna consciousness movement all over
the world that many millions of people are factually coming to the spiritual stage
of life simply by chanting the Hare Krsna mahd-mantra regularly, according to the
prescribed principles. Therefore our request to all our students is that they daily
chant at least sixteen rounds of this Aarer nama maha-mantra offenselessly, follow-
ing the regulative principles. Thus their success will be assured without a doubt.

tion of knowledge, practice of mystic yoga, and performance of austerities and

Text 26] Pastimes of the Lord in His Youth 271
PURPORT
Our Krsna consciousness movement stresses the chanting of the Hare Krsna
mantra only, whereas those who do not know the secret of success for this age of
Kali unnecessarily indulge in the cultivation of knowledge, the practice of mystic
yoga or the performance of fruitive activities or useless austerities. They are simply
wasting their time and misleading their followers. When we point this out very
plainly to an audience, members of opposing groups become angry at us. But accord-
ing to the injunctions of the sdstras, we cannot make compromises with these so-
called jnanis, yogis, karmis and tapasvis. When they say they are as good as we are, we
must say that only we are good and that they are not good. This is not our
obstinacy; it is the injunction of the s@stras. We must not deviate from the injunc-
tions of the $@stras. This is confirmed in the next verse of Caitanya-caritamrta.

ing else; e—in this; tina—three; eva-kara—bearing the meaning of emphasis.
TRANSLATION
This verse clearly states that anyone who accepts any other path cannot be de-
livered. This is the reason for the triple repetition “nothing else, nothing else, noth-
ing else,” which emphasizes the real process of self-realization.

TRANSLATION
For even if one cuts a tree, it never protests, nor even if it is drying up and dying
does it ask anyone for water.
PURPORT
This practice of forbearance (17030 api sunicena) is very difficult, but when one
actually engages in chanting the Hare Krsna mantra, the quality of forbearance auto-
matically develops. A person advanced in spiritual consciousness through the chant-

ing of the Hare Krsna mantra need not practice to develop it separately, for a devo-
tee develops all good qualities simply by chanting the Hare Krsna mantra regularly.

should be satisfied to eat whatever vegetables and fruits are easily available.

“One who thinks himself lower than the grass, who is more tolerant than a tree,
and who does not expect personal honor yet is always prepared to give all respect
to others, can very easily always chant the holy name of the Lord.”
PURPORT
The grass is specifically mentioned in this verse because everyone tramples upon
it yet the grass never protests. This example indicates that a spiritual master or
leader should not be proud of his position; being always humbler than an ordinary
common man, he should go on preaching the cult of Caitanya Mahaprabhu by
chanting the Hare Krsna mantra.

mantra. Therefore one must chant the Hare Krsna mahd-mantra according to the
principles of the above verse, 1700 api sunicena 10707 iva sahisnund. One should
note in this connection that chanting involves the activities of the upper and lower
lips as well as the tongue. All three must be engaged in chanting the Hare Krsna
mahg-maritra. The words ‘Hare Krsna’ should be very distinctly pronounced and
heard. Sometimes one mechanically produces a hissing sound instead of chanting
with the proper pronunciation with the help of the lips and tongue. Chanting is very
simple, but one must practice it seriously. Therefore the author of Caitanya-
caritamyrta, 10105030353 Kaviraja Gosvami, advises everyone to keep this verse always
strung about his neck.

This ecstatic chanting was performed with the doors closed so that nonbelievers
who came to make fun could not gain entrance.
PURPORT
Chanting of the Hare Krsna mahd-mantra is open to everyone, but sometimes
nonbelievers come to disturb the ceremony of chanting. It is indicated herein that
under such circumstances the temple doors should be closed. Only bona fide chant-
ers should be admitted; others should not. But when there is large-scale congrega-
tional chanting of the Hare Krsna mahd-mantra, we keep our temples for everyone
to join, and by the grace of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu this policy has given good
results.

TRANSLATION
One night while kirtana was going on inside Srivasa Thikura’s house, a brahmana
named Gopala (30312, the chief of the nonbelievers, who was talkative and very
rough in his speech, placed all the paraphernalia for worshiping the goddess Durga
outside Srivasa Thakura’s door.
PURPORT
This brdhmapa, Gopila (30312, wanted to defame 94353 Thakura by proving
that he was actually asgkta, or a worshiper of Bhavani, the goddess Durga, but was
externally posing as a Vaignava. In Bengal there is perpetual competition between
the devotees of goddess Kali and the devotees of Lord Krsna. Generally Bengalis,
especially those who are meat-eaters and drunkards, are very much attached to
worshiping the goddesses Durga, Kali, Sitala and Candi. Such devotees, who are
known as $aktas, or worshipers of the sakti-tattva, are always envious of Vaisnavas.
Since Srivasa Thakura was a well-known and respected Vaignava in Navadvipa,
Gopala (30313 wanted to reduce his prestige by bringing him down to the platform


--- Page 279 ---
278 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Adiila, Ch. 17
of the siktas. Therefore outside Srivasa Thakura’s door he placed various parapher-
nalia for worshiping Bhavani, the wife of Lord Siva, such as a red flower, a plantain
leaf, a pot of wine, and reddish sandalwood paste. In the morning, when Srivasa
Thakura saw all this paraphernalia in front of his door, he called for the respectable
gentlemen of the neighborhood and showed them that at night he was worshiping
Bhavani. Very much sorry, these gentlemen called for a sweeper to cleanse the place
and purify it by sprinkling water and cow dung there. T his incident concerning
Gopala Capala is not mentioned in the Caitanya-bhagavata.

“Gentlemen, every night | worship the goddess Bhavani. Since the paraphernalia

PURPORT
According to the Vedic system there are four castes—the brdhmanas, ksotriyas,
vaisyas and $@dras—and below them are the pasicamas, who are lower than the
5८/८5. The higher castes—the brghmanas, the ksatriyas and even the vai§yas— were
known as brahmana-sajjana. The brahmanas especially were known as sajjana, or
respectable gentlemen who guided the entire society. If there were disputes in the
village, people would approach these respectable brahmanias to settle them. Now it


--- Page 281 ---
280 11 Caitanya-caritamrta [Adi-lila, Ch. 17
is very difficult to find such brahmapas and sajjanas, and thus every village and town
is so disrupted that there is no peace and happiness anywhere. To revive a fully
cultured civilization, the scientific division of society into brdahmanas, ksatriyas,
vaisyas and $adras must be introduced all over the world. Unless some people are
trained as brdhmanas, there cannot be peace in human society.

PURPORT
The men in Vedic society who engage in public sanitary activities like picking up
stool and sweeping the street are called hdgis. Sometimes they are untouchable,


--- Page 282 ---
Text 45] Pastimes of the Lord in His Youth 281
especially when engaged in their profession, yet such hagis 2150 have the right to
become devotees. This is established by Sr7 Bhagavad-gita where the Lord declares:

marh hi pdrtha vyapasritya
ye ‘pi syult papa-yonayah
striyo vaiSyas (0८/15 sadras
te ‘pi yanti pardri gatim
“0 son of Prtha, those who take shelter in Me, though they be of lower birth—
women, vai$yas [merchants], as well 25 $@dras [workers]—can approach the supreme
destination.” (Bg. 9.32)

There are many untouchables of the lower caste in India, but according to
Vaisnava principles evesyone is welcome to accept this Krsna consciousness move-
ment on the spiritual platform of life and thus be freed from trouble. Equality or
fraternity on the material platform is impossible.

When Lord Caitanya declares, (7000 api sunicena taror iva sahisgund, He indicates
that one must be above the material conception of life. When one thoroughly under-
stands that he is not the material body but a spiritual soul, he is even humbler than
a man of the lower castes, for he is spiritually elevated. Such humility, in which
one thinks himself lower than the grass, is called sunicatva, and being more tolerant
than a tree is called sahisrutva, forbearance. Being situated in devotional service,
not caring for the material conception of life, is called armanitva, indifference to
material respect; yet a devotee thus situated is called /mdnada, for he is prepared to
give honor to others without hesitation.

Mahatma Gandhi started the hari-jana movement to purify the untouchables,
but he was a failure because he thought that one could become 2 hari-jang, 2 personal
associate of the Lord, through some kind of material adjustment. That is not
possible. Unless one fully realizes that he is not the body but a spiritual soul, there
is no question of his becoming 2 hari-jana. Those who do not follow in the footsteps
of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu and His disciplic succession cannot distinguish
between matter and spirit, and therefore all their ideas are but a mixed-up hodge-
podge of problems. They are virtually 1051 in the bewildering network of Mayadevi.

TRANSLATION
“As an incarnation of God, You are delivering so many fallen souls. | am also a
greatly unhappy fallen soul. Kindly deliver me by Your mercy.”
PURPORT
It appears that although Gopala Capala was sinful, talkative and insulting, he
nevertheless had the qualification of simplicity. Thus he believed Caitanya
Mahaprabhu to be the incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead who
had come to deliver all fallen souls, and he appealed for his own deliverance, seeking
the mercy of the Lord. He did not know, however, that the deliverance of the fallen
does not consist of curing their bodily diseases, although it is also a fact that when a
man is delivered from the material clutches his material bodily diseases are auto-
matically cured. Gopala Capala simply wanted to be delivered from the bodily
sufferings of leprosy, but Sri’ Caitanya, although accepting his sincere appeat,
wanted to inform him of the real cause of suffering.

PURPORT
We should note herein that all our sufferings in this material world, especially
from disease, are due to our past sinful activities. And of all sinful activities, actions
directed against a pure devotee out of sheer envy are considered extremely severe.
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu wanted Gopala Capala to understand the cause of his
suffering. Any person who disturbs a pure devotee engaged in broadcasting the
holy name of the Lord is certainly punished like Gopala Capala. This is the instruc-
tion of Sri Caitanya Mah@prabhu. As we shall see, one who offends a pure devotee

offense and thus rectifies it.

TRANSLATION

“You have made Srivasa Thakura appear to have been worshiping the goddess
Bhavani. Simply for this offense, you will have to fall down into hellish life for ten
million births.

PURPORT

There are many tantric followers who practice the black art of worshiping the
goddess Bhavani in a crematorium, wishing to eat meat and drink wine. Such fools
also consider this bhavani-paja as good as worship of Lord }< {53 in devotional
service. Such abominable tantric activities as performed by so-called svamis and
yogis are herein condemned, however, by Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu. He declares
that such bhavani-piaja for drinking wine and eating meat quickly plunges one into
hellish life. The method of worship itself is already hellish, and its results must also
be hellish and nothing more.

Many rascals say that whatever way one accepts, one will ultimately reach
Brahman. Yet we can see from this verse how such persons reach Brahman. Brahman
spreads everywhere, but appreciation of Brahman in different objects leads to
different results. In Bhagavad-gita the Lord says, ye yatha marh prapadyante 15/75
tathaiva bhajamy aham: *‘| reward everyone according to his surrender unto Me.”
(Bg. 4.11) Mayavadis certainly realize Brahman in certain aspects, but realization
of Brahman in the aspects of wine, women and meat is not the same realization of
Brahman that devotees achieve by chanting, dancing and eating prasada. Mayavadi
philosophers, being educated in paltry knowledge, think all sorts of Brahman reali-
zation one and the same and do not consider varieties. But although Krsna is every-
where, by His inconceivable potency He is simultaneously not everywhere. Thus the
Brahman realization of the tantric cult is not the same Brahman realization as that
of pure devotees. Unless one reaches the highest point of Brahman realization,

Krsna consciousness, he is punishable. All people except Kisna conscious devotees
are to some proportion pdsandis, or demons, and thus they are punishable by the
Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, as stated below.

PURPORT
Lord Caitanya’s mission is the same as that of Lord Krsna, as stated in Bhagavad-
gita:
vada yada hi dharmasya
glanir bhavati bharata
abhyutthanam adharmasya
tadatmanarn sgjamy aham
paritrapdya sadhana
vindsaya ca duskrtam

“Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of
Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion—at that time | descend Myself. In
order to deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to reestablish
the principles of religion, | advent Myself millennium after millennium." (88. 4.7-8)
As explained here, the real purpose of an incarnation of Godhead is to kill the
atheists and maintain the devotees. He does not say, like so many rascal incarnations,
that both atheists and devotees are on the same platform. Sei Caitanya Mahaprabhu
or Lord Sri Krsna, the real Personality of Godhead, does not advocate such an idea.


--- Page 288 ---
Texts 55-56] Pastimes of the Lord in His Youth 287
Atheists are punishable, whereas devotees are to be protected. To maintain this
principle is the mission of all gvatdras, or incarnations. One must therefore identify
an incarnation by His activities, not by popular votes or mental concoctions. 917
Caitanya Mahiprabhu gave protection to devotees and killed many demons in the
course of His preaching work. He specifically mentioned that the Mayavadi
philosophers are the greatest demons. Therefore He warned alt others not to hear
the Mayavada philosophy. Mdyavadi-bhasya $unile haya sarva-nasa: simply by hear-
ing the Mayavida interpretation of the $dstras, one is doomed (Cc. Madhya 6.169).

Puri and then came back to the village of Kuliya, upon His return that sinful man
took shelter at the Lord's lotus feet. The Lord, being merciful to him, gave him
instructions for his benefit.
PURPORT
Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura, in his Anubhasya, has given the following
note in connection with the village Kuliya. The village originally known as Kuliya
has developed into what is now the city of Navadvipa. In various authorized books
like Bhakti-ratnakara, Caitanya-carita-mahakavya, Caitanya-candrodaya-nataka and
Caitanya-bhagavata it is mentioned that the village Kuliyd is on the western side of
the Ganges. Even now, within the area known as Koladvipa, there is a place known
as kuliara ganja and a place called kufigra daha, both within the jurisdiction of
the present municipality of Navadvipa. In the time of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu
there were two villages named Kuliya and Pahagdapura on the western side of the
Ganges, both belonging to the jurisdiction of Bahiradvipa. At that time the place on
the eastern side of the Ganges now known as Antardvipa was known as Navadvipa.
At Sri Mayapur that place is still known as Dvipera Matha. There is another place of
the name Kuliya near Karicadapada, but it is not the same Kuliya mentioned here.
It cannot be accepted as aparddha-bhafijanera pata, or the place where the offense
was excused, for that occurred in the above-mentioned Kuliya on the western side
of the Ganges. For business reasons many envious persons oppose excavation of the
real place, and sometimes they advertise unauthorized places as the authorized one.

One should know with firm conviction that the Lord, being transcendental, is
never subject to any curse or benediction. Only ordinary living entities are subjected
to curses and the punishments of Yamaraja. As the Supreme Personality of God-
head, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is beyond such punishments and benedictions. When
one understands this fact with faith and love, he personally becomes free from ali
curses uttered by 6/2/1/720/705 or anyone else. This incident is not mentioned in the
Caitanya-bhdgavata.

TRANSLATION
Lord $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu blessed Mukunda Datta with punishment and in
that way vanquished all his mental depression.
PURPORT
Mukunda Datta was once forbidden to enter the association of Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu because of his mixing with the Mayavadi impersonalists. When Lord
Caitanya manifested His mahd-prakdsa, He called all the devotees one after another
and blessed them, while Mukunda Datta stood outside the door. The devotees in-
formed the Lord that Mukunda Datta was waiting outside, but the Lord replied,
“I shall not soon be pleased with Mukunda Datta, for he explains devotional service
among devotees, but then he goes to Mayavadis to hear from them the Yoga-
vasistha-ramdyana, which is full of Mayavada philosophy. For this ] am greatly
displeased with him." Hearing the Lord speak in that way, Mukunda Datta, standing
outside, was exceedingly glad that the Lord would at some time be pleased with
him, aithough He was not pleased at that moment. But when the Lord understood
that Mukunda Datta was going to give up the association of the Mayavadis for good,
He was pleased, and He at once called to see Mukunda. Thus He delivered him
from the association of the Mayavadis and gave him the association of pure devotees.

294 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Adi-ila, Ch. 17
PURPORT
Advaita Acarya was a disciple of Madhavendra Puri, [5५212 Puri’s spiritual master.
Therefore 1५272 Puri, the spiritual master of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, was Advaita
Acarya’s Godbrother. As such, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu treated Advaita Acarya
as His spiritual master, but Sri Advaita Acarya did not like this behavior of Lord
Caitanya, for He wanted to be treated as His eternal servant. Advaita Prabhu’s
aspiration was to be a servant of the Lord, not His spiritual master. He therefore
devised a plan to antagonize the Lord. He began to explain the path of philosophical
speculation in the midst of some unfortunate Mayavadis, and when Lord Caitanya
Mahaprabhu heard about this, He immediately went there and in a very angry mood
began to beat Advaita Aciarya. At that time, Advaita Acarya, greatly pleased, began
to dance, saying, ‘‘Just see how My desire has now been fulfilled! Lord Caitanya
Mahaprabhu used to treat Me honorably for so long, but now He is treating Me
neglectfully. This is My reward. His affection for Me is so great that He wanted to
save Me from the hands of the Mayavadis.”” Hearing this statement, Lord Caitanya
Mahaprabhu was somewhat ashamed, but He was very much pleased with Advaita
Acarya.

His sasikirtana party to the house of $ridhara, and Chand Kazi followed Him. All
the devotees rested there for some time and drank water from Sridhara’s damaged
iron pot. The Lord accepted the water because the pot belonged to a devotee.
Chand Kazi then returned home. The place where they rested is still situated on the
northeastern side of Mayapur, and it is known 25 kirtana-visrima-sthana, ‘‘the resting
place of the kirtana party.”

Him to do so. Therefore she accused Him of this, which was an offense at Advaita

When Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu explained the glories of the transcendental potency
of the Lord's holy name, the Hare Krsna mahd-mantra, one unfortunate student said
that such glorification of the holy name was an exaggeration in the Sastras to induce


--- Page 298 ---
Text 75] Pastimes of the Lord in His Youth 297
people to take to it. In this way the student interpreted the glories of the holy name.
This is called artha-vada, and it is one of the ten offenses at the lotus feet of the
holy name of the Lord. There are many kinds of offenses, but the offense
known as ndma-gpar@dha, an offense at the lotus feet of the holy name, is
extremely dangerous. The Lord therefore warned everyone not to see the
face of the offender. He immediately took a bath in the Ganges with all His
clothes to teach everyone to avoid such a nama-aparadha. The holy name is identical
with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There is no difference between the per-
son God and His holy name. This is the absolute position of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. Therefore one who distinguishes between the Lord and His name is
called a pdsapdhi, or nonbeliever, an atheistic demon. Glorification of the holy name
is glorification of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One should never attempt
to distinguish between the Lord and His name or interpret the glories of the holy
name as mere exaggerations.

TRANSLATION

[ The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, said:] “My dear Uddhava, neither
through astaniga-yoga [the mystic yoga system to control the senses], nor through
impersonal monism or an analytical study of the Absolute Truth, nor through study
of the Vedas, nor through practice of austerities, nor through charity, nor through
acceptance of sannyasa can one satisfy Me as much as one can by developing
unalloyed devotional service unto Me.”

PURPORT

Karmis, jadnis, yogis, tapasvis and students of Vedic literature who do not have
Krsna consciousness simply beat around the bush and do not get any final profit
because they have no clear knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Nor do they have faith in approaching Him by discharging devotional service,
although everywhere such service is repeatedly emphasized, as it is in this verse from
Srimad-Bhagavatam {11.14.20}. Bhagavad-gita also declares, bhaktya mam abhijanati
yavan yas cdsmi tattvatah: *‘One can understand the Supreme Personality as He is
only by devotional service.” {Bg. 18.55) If one wants to understand the Supreme
Personality factually, he must take to the path of devotional service and not waste
time in profitless philosophical speculation, fruitive activity, mystic yogic practice

Text 78] Pastimes of the Lord in His Youth 299
orsevere austerity and penance. Elsewhere in Bhagavad-gita (12.5) the Lord confirms
kleso 'dhikataras tesam avyaktasakta-cetasam: ‘For those whose minds are attached
to the wnmanifested, impersonal feature of the Supreme, advancement is very
troublesome.” People who are attached to the impersonal feature of the Lord are
obliged to take great trouble, yet nevertheless they cannot understand the Absolute
Truth. As explained in Srimad-8hagavatam (1.2.11) ,brahmeti paramatmeti bhagavan
iti Sabdyate. Unless one understands the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the
original source of both Brahman and Paramatma, one is still in darkness about the
Absolute Truth.

goddess of fortune, it is simply wonderful, my dear Lord Kfspa, that You have
embraced me with Your arms.”

PURPORT

This is a verse from Srimad-8hagavatam (10.81.16) spoken by Sudama Vipra in
the presence of Lord Sri Krsna. This and the previous verse quoted from Srimad-
Bhagovatam clearly indicate that although Krsna is so great that it is not possible
for anyone to satisfy Him, He exhibits His greatness by being personally satisfied
even with one who is disqualified from so many angles of vision. Sudama Vipra was
born in a family of brghmanas, and he was a learned scholar and a class friend of
Krsna's, yet he considered himself unfit to be strictly called a brahmana. He called
himself a brahma-bandhu, meaning “one born in a brdhmapa family but not
brahminically qualified.” Because of His great respect for brahmanas, however,
Krsna embraced Sudama Vipra, although he was not a regular brdhmana but a
brahma-bandhu, or friend of a brahmarna family. Murari Gupta could not be called
even a brahma-bandhu because he was born of a vaidya family and according to the
social structure was therefore considered a 5240. But Krsna bestowed special mercy
upon Murari Gupta because he was a beloved devotee of the Lord, 25 stated by Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu. The purport of Sri Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura's
elaborate discussion of this subject is that no qualification in this material world
can satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, yet everything becomes
successful simply through development of devotional service to the Lord.

The members of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness cannot
even call themselves brahma-bandhus. Therefore our only means for satisfying Krsna
is to pursue the injunctions of Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who says:

yare dekha, tare kaha ‘krsna’-upadesa
amara djiidya guru (0406 tara’ ef desa
“Whomever you meet, instruct him on the teachings of Krsna. In this way, on My
order, become a spiritual master and deliverthe people of this country.” (Cc. Madhya
7.128) Simply trying to follow the orders of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, we speak to
the people of the world about 8hagavad-gita As /t Is. This will make us qualified to
satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna.

TRANSLATION
Once while Caitanya Mahaprabhu was performing kirtana, clouds assembled in
the sky, and the Lord, by His own will, immediately stopped them from pouring
rain.
PURPORT
In this connection $rilaBhaktivinoda Thakura says that once when Lord Caitanya
was performing sahkirtana a short way from the village, some clouds appeared over-
head. By the supreme will of the Lord, the clouds were asked to disperse, and they
did. Because of this incident, that place is still known as meghera cara. Since the
course of the Ganges has now changed, the village of the name Belapukhuriya,
which was formerly situated in a different place, called Taranavasa, has now become
known as the meghera cara. The Madhya-khapda of the Caitanya-marngala also relates
that once at the end of the day, when evening clouds assembled overhead and
thundered threateningly, all the Vaisnavas were very much afraid. But the Lord
took His karatdlas in His hands and personally began chanting the Hare Krsna
mantra, looking up towards the sky as if to direct the demigods in the higher planets.
Thusall theassembled clouds dispersed, and as the sky became clear, with the moon
rising, the Lord began dancing very happily with His jubilant and satisfied devotees.

The Caitanyamargala, Madhya-khanda, describes this incident as follows. 517५३52
Pandita was performing the sr@ddha ceremony of his father, and, as is customary, he
was hearing the thousand names of Lord Visnu. At that time Gaurahari (Lord
Caitanya) appeared on the scene, and He also began to hear the thousand names of
Vigpu with full satisfaction. When He thus heard the holy name of Lord Nrsifmha,
Lord Caitanya became absorbed in thought, and He became angry like Nrsimha
Prabhu in His angry mood. His eyes became red, His hairs stood on end, all the parts
of His body trembled, and He made a thundering sound. All of a sudden He took up
a club, and people became greatly afraid, thinking, “We do not know what kind of
offense we have now committed!” But then Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu adjusted His
thoughts and sat down on His seat.

Then Lord Caitanya, adopting the mood of Lord $iva, got on the man's shoulders,
and thus they danced together for a long time.
PURPORT
Lord Caitanya Mahiprabhu adopted the mood of Lord Siva, for He is Siva also.
According to the philosophy of acintya-bhedabheda-tattva, 1-০10 Siva is not differ-
ent from Lord Visnu, but still Lord Siva is not Lord Visnu, just as yogurt is nothing
but mitk and yet is not mitk nevertheless. One cannot get the benefit of milk by
drinking yogurt. Similarly, one cannot get salvation by worshiping Lord Siva. If one
wants salvation, one must worship Lord Vispu. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita
(9.4). Mat-sthani sarva-bhitani na cGharh tesv avasthitah: everything is resting on the
Lord, for everything is His potential energy, yet He is not everywhere. Lord
Caitanya’s adopting the mood of Lord Siva is not extraordinary, but one should not
therefore think that by worshiping Lord Siva he is worshiping Lord Caitanya. That
would be a mistake.

312 Set Caitanya-caritimrta [Adi-lila, Ch. 17
TRANSLATION

On another day an astrologer came who was supposed to know everything—past,
present and future. Thus $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu received him with all honor and
put this question before him.

PURPORT

Brahmapas generally used to become astrologers, Ayur-vedic physicians, teachers
and priests. Although highly learned and respectable, such 87/72/7705 went from
door to door to distribute their knowledge. A brahmapa would first go to a house-
holder’s home to give information about the functions to be performed on a particu-
lar tithi, or date, but if there were sickness in the family, the family members would
consult the brahmapa as a physician, and the brahmapa would give instruction and
some medicine. Often, since the brahmapas were expert in astrology, people would
also be greatly inquisitive about their past, present and future.

Although the brahmana appeared at Lord Caitanya’s house as a beggar, Lord
Caitanya Mahaprabhu received him with great respect because he was a qualified
brahmana who knew the astrological science perfectly. Although brdhmanas
would go door to door just like beggars, they were honored as very respectable
guests. This was the system in Hindu society five hundred years ago, during
the time of Caitanya Mahaprabhu. This system was current even one hundred
years ago; even fifty orsixty years ago, when we were children, such brahmapas would
visit householders like humble beggars, and people would derive great benefit from
the mercy of such brahmapas. The greatest benefit was that a householder could save
a great deal of money from being spent on doctor bills because the brahmanas, aside
from explaining the past, present and future, could ordinarily cure all kinds of diseases
simply by giving instructions and some medicine. Thus no one was bereft of the bene-
fit of a first-class physician, astrologer and priest. The important members of ISKCON
should give careful attention to our Dallas school, where children are being taught
Sanskrit and English to become perfect brahmanpas. If they are actually trained as
perfect braghmapas, they can save society from rogues and ruffians; indeed, people
can live happily under the protection of qualified brdhmanas. Therefore Bhagavad:
gita (4.13) gives special stress to the division of society {catur-varpyarn maya srstarn
gupa-karma-vibhagasah). Unfortunately some people are now claiming to be
brahmapas simply by birthright, with no qualifications. Therefore the entire
society is in chaos.

TRANSLATION
“Please tefl Me who | was in My previous birth,” the Lord said. “Please tell Me by
your astrological computations.” Hearing the words of the Lord, the astrologer
immediately began to calculate.
PURPORT
Through astrology one can know past, present and future. Modern western
astronomers have no knowledge of the past or future, nor can they perfectly say
anything about the present. Herein we find, however, that after hearing Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu’s order, the astrologer immediately began his calculations. This was
not a facade; he actually knew how to ascertain one’s past life through astrology. A
still existing treatise called the Bhrgu-sarnhita describes a system by which anyone
can immediately get information about what he was in the past and what he is going
to be in the future. The brédhmaras who went door to door as if beggars had perfect
command of such vast knowledge. Thus the highest knowledge was easily available
even to the poorest man in society. The poorest man could inquire from an astrolo-
ger about his past, present and future, with no need for business agreements or ex-
orbitant payments. The brahmana would give him all the benefit of his knowledge
without asking remuneration, and the poor man, in return, would offer a handful of
rice, or anything he had in his possession, to satisfy the br@hmapa. In a perfect
human society, perfect knowledge in any science—medical, astrological, ecclesiasti-
cal and so on—is available even to the poorest man, with no anxiety over payment. In
the present day, however, no one can get justice, medical treatment, astrological
help or ecclesiastical enlightenment without money, and since people are generally
poor, they are bereft of the benefits of all these great sciences.

--- Page 315 ---
314 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Adi-lila, Ch. 17
PURPORT

Here we get some information of the Vaikuntha world or spiritual world.
Vaikuntha means ‘‘without anxiety.” In the material world, everyone is full of
anxiety, but another world, where there is no anxiety, is described in Bhagavad gita:

paras tasmdt tu 800৮০ ‘nyo
‘vyakto ‘vyaktat sanatanab
yal sa sarvesu bhitesu
nasyatsu na vinasyati
‘“Yet there is another nature, which is eternal and is transcendental to this mani-
fested and unmanifested matter. It is supreme and is never annihilated. When all in
this world is annihilated, that part remains as it 15. (Bg. 8.20)

As there are many planets within the material world, there are many millions of
planets, called Vaikupthalokas, in the spiritual world. All these Vaikunthalokas, or
superior planets, rest on the effulgence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As
stated in the Brahma-sarithita (yasya prabhd prabhavato jagadapgla-koli), the
Brahman effulgence emanating from the body of the Supreme Lord creates innumer-
able planets in both the spiritual and material worlds; thus these planets are creations
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The astrologer saw Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu
to be the very same Personality of Godhead. We can just imagine how learned he
was, yet he was traveling door to door, just like an ordinary beggar, for the highest
benefit of human society.

PURPORT

Herein it is clearly indicated that the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Brahman, is,

in the ultimate issue, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore a person is the

beginning of all things. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (10.8), mattafr sarvarn
pravartate: everything begins from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The
Supreme Lord is the supreme living entity. Therefore whatever exists, whether
matter or spirit, is all but an emanation from the Supreme Person or supreme life.
The modern scientists’ theory that life begins from matter is nonsense. Both matter
and life begin from life. Unfortunately the scientists do not know this scientific
fact; they are drifting in the darkness of their socalled knowledge.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is identified by the symptoms mentioned in
the sastras. It is not that anyone and everyone can become God without proof from
$dstras.

gopa-grhe—in the house of a cowherd; janma—birth; chila—there was; gabhira—
of the cows; rakhii/a—protector; sei pupye—by those pious activities; hailan—

TRANSLATION
“In My last birth | was born in the family of cowherd men, and | gave protection
to the calves and cows. Because of such pious activities, | have now become the
son of a brahmapa.”
PURPORT
The words of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu, the greatest authority, herein clearly
indicate that one becomes pious simply by keeping cows and protecting them. Un-
fortunately, people have become such rascals that they do not even care about the
words of an authority. People generally consider cowherd men lowly members of
society, but herein Caitanya Mahaprabhu confirms that they are so pious that in
their next lives they are going to be brahmanas. The caste system has a specific pur-
pose. if thisscientific systemis followed, human society will get the greatest benefit.
Heeding this instruction by the Lord, people should serve cows and calves and in
return get ample quantities of milk. There is no loss in serving the cows and calves,
but modern human society has become so degraded that instead of giving protection
to the cows and serving them, people are killing them. How can they expect peace
and prosperity in human society while committing such sinful activities? It is
impossible.

PURPORT
It appears that the astrologer not only was a knower of past, present and future
through astrological calculation, but was a great meditator as well. Therefore he
was a great devotee and could see Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu to be the same per-
sonality as Krsna. He was puzzled, however, about whether Krsna and 61 Caitanya
Mahaprabhu were actually the same person.

Srkesna-caitanya radha-krspa nahe anya: in the vision of a perfect devotee, Lord
Caitanya Mahaprabhu is a combination of Radha and Kyspa. One who sees Lord
Caitanya to be different from Krsna is under the illusory energy of the Lord. It
appears that the astrologer was already an advanced devotee, and when he came into
the presence of the Supreme Lord $7 Caitanya Mahiprabhu, he became perfectly
self-realized and could see that the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krsna and ঝা
Caitanya Mahaprabhu are one and the same Supreme Person.

TRANSLATION
The all-knowing astrologer concluded: “Whatever You may be or whoever You
may be, | offer my respectful obeisances unto You!” By His causeless mercy, the
Lord then gave him love of Godhead, thus rewarding him for his service.
PURPORT
The incident of Lord Caitanya’s meeting the all-knowing astrologer is not
mentioned in the Caitanya-bhagavata, but we cannot therefore say that it did not
take place. On the contrary, we must accept the statement of Krspadasa Kaviraja
Gosvami that whatever the Caitanya-bhagavata did not mention he has especially
mentioned in Caitanya-caritamyta.

TRANSLATION
After drinking the water, Lord Caitanya became so ecstatic that He began to
dance. Thus everyone saw the pastime of attracting the River Yamuna.
PURPORT
Yamunakarsapa-/ila is the pastime of attracting Yamuna. One day, Sri Baladeva
wanted the Yamuna River to come before Him, and when the River Yamuna refused,
He took His plow, wanting to dig a canal so that Yamuna would be obliged to
come there. Since Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is the original form of Baladeva, in His
ecstasy He asked everyone to bring honey. In this way, all the devotees standing
there saw the yamundkarsapa-/7/a. ॥॥ this (700, Baladeva was accompanied by His girl
friends. After drinking a honey beverage called Varuni, He wanted to jump in the
Yamuna and swim with the girls. It is stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.65.25-30,33)
that Lord Baladeva asked Yamuna to come near, and when the river disobeyed the
order of the Lord, He became angry and thus wanted to snatch her near to Him with
His plow. Yamuna, however, very much afraid of Lord Balarama's anger, immediately
came and surrendered unto Him, praying to the Lord, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, and admitting her fault. She was then excused. This is the sum and sub-
stance of the yamundkarsapa-iita. The incident is also described in the prayer of
Jayadeva Gosvami concerning the ten incarnations:

When the sarikirtana movement thus started, no one in Navadvipa could hear

PURPORT
The International Society for Krishna Consciousness now has its world center in
Navadvipa, Mayapur. The managers of this center should see that twenty-four hours
a day there is chanting of the holy names of the Hare Krsna maha-mantra, with the
addition of haraye namah, krsria yadavaya namah, for this song was a favorite of
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. But all such sarikirtana must be preceded by the
chanting of the holy names of the five tattvas—Sri-krspa-caitanya prabhu nityananda
$ri-advaita gadadhara srivasadi-gaura-bhakta-vrnda. We are already accustomed to
chant these two mantras—s$ri-krspa-caitanya prabhu nitydnanda sri-advaita gadadhara
Srivasadi-goura-bhakta-vrnda and Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/
Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. Now, after these, the other two
lines—namely, haraye namah, krsna yadavaya namah] gopdla govinda rama গা
madhusidana—should be added, especially in Mayapur. Chanting of these six lines
should go on so perfectly well that no one there hears any other vibration than the
chanting of the holy names of the Lord. That will make the center spiritually all-
perfect.

Hearing the resounding vibration of the Hare Krsna mantra, the local

PURPORT
The phaujadara, or city magistrate, was called the kgji (Kazi). The jamidaras
(Zamindars), or landholders {mangalerds), levied taxes on the land, but keeping law
and order and punishing criminals was the duty entrusted to the Kazi. Both the Kazi
and the landholders were under the control of the governor of Bengal, which at
that time was known 25 Suba-barigala. The districts of Nadia, Islampura and Bagoyana
were all under the Zamindar named Hari Hoda or his descendant known as Kgsnadasa
Hoda. It is said that Chand Kazi was the spiritual master of Nawab Hussain Shah.
According to one opinion his name was Maulana Sirajuddina, and according to
another his name was Habibara Rahamana. Descendants of Chand Kazi are still
living in the vicinity of Mayapur. People still go see the tomb of Chand Kazi, which
is underneath a campaka tree and is known as Chand Kazi’s samadhi.

TRANSLATION
‘““For so long you did not follow the regulative principles of the Hindu religion,
but now you are following them with great enthusiasm. May | know by whose
strength you are doing so?
PURPORT
It appears that from the aggression of Vaktiyara Khiliji in Bengal until the time of
Chand Kazi, Hindus, or the followers of the Vedic principles, were greatly sup-
pressed. Like the Hindus in present-day Pakistan, practically no one could execute
the Hindu religious principles freely. Chand Kazi referred to this condition of Hindu
society. Formerly the Hindus had not been straightforward in executing their Hindu
principles, but now they were freely chanting the Hare Krsna mohd-mantra. There-
fore it must have been by the strength of someone else that they were so daring.
Actually, that was the fact. Although the members of the so-called Hindu society
had followed the social customs and formulas, they had practically forgotten to
execute their religious principles strictly. But with the presence of Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu they actually began following the regulative principles according to
His order. That order is still existing, and anywhere and everywhere, in all parts of
the world, one can execute it. That order is to become a spiritual master under the
direction of Sri Caitanya Mahiaprabhu by following the regulative principles,
chanting daily at least sixteen rounds of the Hare Krsna mahd-mantra, and preaching
the cult of Krsna consciousness all over the world. If we adhere to the order of Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu, we shall get spiritual strength without a doubt, and we shall
be free to preach this cult of the Hare Krsna movement and not be hampered by
anyone.

PURPORT
Such orders stopping sankirtana in the streets of the world’s great cities have
been imposed upon members of the Hare Kysna movement. We have hundreds of
centers all over the world, and we have been specifically persecuted in Australia.
In most cities of the western world we have been arrested many times by the police,
but we are nevertheless executing the order ০811 Caitanya Mahaprabhu by chanting
on the streets of all the important cities, like New York, London, Chicago, Sydney,
Melbourne, Paris and Hamburg. We must remember that such incidents took place
in the past, five hundred years ago, and the fact that they are still going on indicates
that our sankirtana movement is really authorized, for if sankirtana were an insig-
nificant material affair, demons would not object to it. The demons of the time
tried to obstruct the sarnkirtana movement started by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.
Similar demons are trying to obstruct the sarkirtana movement we are executing all
over the world, and this proves that our sankirtana movement is still pure and
genuine, following in the footsteps of $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.

“The next time | see someone performing such sankirtana, certainly | shall

PURPORT
To convert a Hindu into a Mohammedan was an easy affair in those days. If a
Mohammedan simply sprinkled water on the body of a Hindu, it was supposed that
the Hindu had already become a Mohammedan. During the transition of the British
in Bangladesh during the last Hindu-Muslim riots, many Hindus were converted into

Text 130) Pastimes of the Lord in His Youth 327
Mohammedans by having cows’ flesh forcibly pushed into their mouths. Hindu
society was so rigid at the time of Lord Caitanya that if a Hindu were converted
into a Mohammedan, there was no chance of his being reformed. In this way the
Mohammedan population in India increased. None of the Mohammedans came from
outside; 50013] customs somehow or other forced Hindus to become Mohammedans,
with no chance of returning to Hindu society. Emperor Auranzeb also inaugurated
a tax that Hindus had to pay because of their being Hindus. Thus all the poor
Hindus of the lower class voluntarily became Mohammedans to avoid the tax. In
this way the Mohammedan population in India increased. Chand Kazi threatened
to convert the people into Mohammedans by the simple process of sprinkling water
on their bodies.

PURPORT
Gandhi is known for having started the movement of nonviolent civil disobedience
in India, but about five hundred years before him, € Caitanya Mahaprabhu started
His movement of nonviolent civil disobedience to the order of Chand Kazi. it is not
necessary to commit violence to stop the opposition from hindering a movement,
for one can kill their demoniac behavior with reason and argument. Following in
the footsteps of Lord Caitanya Mahiprabhu, whenever there are obstacles the Hare
Krsna movement should kill the opposition with reason and argument and thus stop
their demoniac behavior. If we became violent in every case, it would be difficult for
us to manage our affairs. We should therefore follow in the footsteps of Lord
Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who disobeyed the order of Chand Kazi but subdued him
with reason and argument.

The Kazi had issued an order not to perform kirtana, congregational chanting of

Mah3prabhu, He ordered civil disobedience to the Kazi's order. Lord Caitanya and
all His devotees, naturally enthusiastic although agitated, must have made a great
noise with their loud cries.

Text 141] Pastimes of the Lord in His Youth 333
TRANSLATION

The loud sound of the chanting of the Hare Krspa mantra certainly made the
Kazi very much afraid, and he hid himself within his room. Hearing the people thus
protesting, murmuring in great anger, the Kazi would not come out of his home.

PURPORT

The Kazi’s order not to perform sasikirtana could stand only as long as there was
no civil disobedience. Under the leadership of the Supreme Lord, Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu, the chanters, increasing in number, disobeyed the order of the Kazi.
Thousands assembled together and formed parties, chanting the Hare Krsna maha-
mantra and making a tumultuous sound of protest. Thus the Kazi was very much
afraid, as naturally one should be under such circumstances.

In the present day also, people all over the world may join together in the Krsna
consciousness movement and protest against the present degraded governments of
the world’s godless societies, which are based on all kinds of sinful activities. The
Srimad-Bhagavatam states that in the age of Kali, thieves, rogues and fourth-class
people who have neither education nor culture capture the seats of governments to
exploit the citizens. This is a symptom of Kali-yuga that has already appeared.
People cannot feel secure about their lives and property, yet the so-called govern-
ments continue, and its ministers get fat salaries, although they are unable to do
anything good for society. The only remedy for such conditions is to enhance the
sankirtana movement under the banner of Krsna consciousness and protest against
the sinful activities of all the world’s governments.

The Krsna consciousness movement is not a sentimental religious movement; it is
a movement for the reformation of all the anomalies of human society. If people
take to it seriously, discharging this duty scientifically, as ordered by Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu, the world will see peace and prosperity instead of being confused and
hopeless under useless governments. There are always rogues and thieves in human
society, and as soon as a weak government is unable to execute its duties, these
rogues and thieves come out to do their business. Thus the entire society becomes
a hell unfit for gentlemen to live in. There is an immediate need for a good govern-
ment—a government by the people, with Krsna consciousness. Unless the masses of
people become Krsna conscious, they cannot be good men. The Krsna consciousness
movement that Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu started by chanting the Hare Krsna maha-
mantra still has its potency. Therefore people should understand it seriously and
scientifically and spread it all over the world.

The sankirtana movement started by ऽं Caitanya Mahaprabhu is described in the
Caitanya-bhagavata, Madhya-khanda, Twenty-third Chapter, beginning with verse
241, which states, “My dear Lord, let my mind be fixed at Your lotus feet.” Follow-
ing Lord Caitanya’s chanting, all the devotees reproduced the same sound He chanted.
In this way the Lord proceeded, leading the entire party on the strand roads by the
bank of the Ganges. When the Lord came to His own ghdta, or bathing place, He
danced more and more. Then He proceeded to Madhai’sghata. In this way ("नं
Mahaprabhu, the Supreme Lord, who was known as Visvambhara, danced all over
the banks of the Ganges. Then He proceeded to Biarakona-ghata, the Nagariya-ghata,

and, traveling through Ganganagara, reached Simuliya, a quarter at one end of the
town. All these places surround Sri Mayapur. After reaching Simuliya, the Lord
proceeded towards the Kazi's house, and in this way He reached the door of Chand
Kazi.

Some of the men in Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s civil disobedience movement were
agitated because they could not control their minds. But the Lord was thoroughly
peaceful,sober and unagitated. Therefore when the Kazi came down to see Him, the
Lord offered him proper respect and a seat because he was a respectable government
officer. Thus the Lord taught us by His personal behavior. In pushing on our
sankirtana movement of Krsna consciousness, we might have to face difficult days,
but we should always follow in the footsteps of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and do
the needful according to the time and circumstances.

TRANSLATION
“In our village relationship, Nilambara Cakravarti Thakura was my uncle. Such
a relationship is stronger than a bodily relationship.
PURPORT
In India, even in the interior villages, all the Hindu and Muslim communities
used to live very peacefully by establishing a relationship between them. The young
men called the elderly members of the village by the name cdca or (९2९2, “uncle,”
and men of the same age called each other dada, ‘‘brother.” The relationship was
very friendly. There were even invitations from Mohammedan houses to Hindu
houses and from Hindu houses to Mohammedan houses. Both the Hindus and the
Mohammedans accepted the invitations to go to each other’s houses to attend
ceremonial functions. Even until fifty or sixty years ago, the relationship between
Hindus and Muslims was very friendly, and there were no disturbances. We do not
find any Hindu-Muslim riots in the history of India, even during the days of the
Mohammedans’ 1819 over the country. Conflict between Hindus and Muslims was
created by polluted politicians, especially foreign rulers, and thus the situation
gradually became so degraded that India was divided into Hindustan and Pakistan.
Fortunately, the remedy to unite not only the Hindus and Muslims but all
communities and all nations can still be implemented by the Hare Krsna movement
on the strong basic platform of love of Godhead.

“Since the bull and cow are your father and mother, how can you kill and eat
them? What kind of religious principle is this? On what strength are you so daring
that you commit such sinful activities?’
PURPORT
Everyone can understand that we drink the milk of cows and take the help of
bulls in producing agricultural products. Therefore, since our real father gives us


--- Page 341 ---
340 iT Caitanya-caritimrta [Adi-lila, Ch. 17
food grains and our mother gives us milk with which to live, the cow and bull are
considered our father and mother. According to Vedic civilization, there are seven
mothers, of which the cow is one. Therefore Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu challenged
the Mohammedan Kazi, “What kind of religious principle do you follow by killing
your father and mother to eat them?” In any civilized human society, no one
would dare kill his father and mother for the purpose of eating them. Therefore Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu challenged the system of Mohammedan religion as patricide
and matricide. In the Christian religion also, a principal commandment is “Thou
shalt not kill.” Nevertheless, Christians violate this rule; they are very expert in
killing and in opening slaughterhouses. In our Krsna consciousness movement, our
first provision is that no one should be allowed to eat any kind of flesh. It does not
matter whether it is cows’ flesh or goats' flesh, but we especially stress the pro-
hibition against cows’ flesh because according to $astra the cow is our mother. Thus
the Mohammedans’ cow killing was challenged by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.

The Kazi replied: “As You have Your scriptures called the Vedas and Puranas,

PURPORT
Chand Kazi agreed to talk with Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu on the strength of the
scriptures. According to the Vedic scripture, if one can support his position by
quoting from the Vedas, his argument is perfect. Similarly, when the Mohammedans
support their position with quotations from the Koran, their arguments are also
authorized. When Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu raised the question of the
Mohammedans’ cow killing and bull killing, Chand Kazi came to the standard of
understanding from his scriptures.

TRANSLATION
On the path of material activities, there is regulation for killing cows. If such
killing is done under the guidance of scripture, there is no sin.
PURPORT
The word $dstra is derived from the dhdtu, or verbal root, sas. Sas-dhatu pertains
to controlling or ruling. A government's ruling through force or weapons is called
Sastra. Thus whenever there is ruling, either by weapons or by injunctions, the sas-
dhatu is the basic principle. Between sastra {ruling through weapons) and &25 ८/८
{ruling through the injunctions of the scriptures), the better is 525८८. Our Vedic
scriptures are not ordinary law books of human common sense; they are the state-
ments of factually liberated persons unaffected by the imperfectness of the senses.
$astra must be correct always, not sometimes correct and sometimes incorrect.
In the Vedic scriptures, the cow is described as a mother. Therefore she is a mother


--- Page 343 ---
342 SIT Caitanya-caritamsta [Adi-lila, Ch. 17
for all time; it is not, as some rascals say, that in the Vedic age she was a mother but
she is not in this age. If $Gstra is an authority, the cow is a mother always; she was a
mother in the Vedic age, and she is a mother in this age also.

If one acts according to the injunctions of $Gstra, he is freed from the reactions
of sinful activity. For example, the propensities for eating flesh, drinking wine and
enjoying sex life are all natural to the conditioned soul. The path of such enjoyment
is called pravrtti-marga. The $astra says,pravrttir esarin bhitanarn nivrttis tu maha-
phalam: one should not be carried away by the propensities of defective conditioned
life; one should be guided by the principles of the $astras. A child's propensity is to
play all day long, but it is the injunction of the $@stras that the parents should take
care to educate him. The sdstros are there just to guide the activities of human
society. But because people do not refer to the instructions of $gstras, which are free
from defects and imperfections, they are therefore misguided by so-called educated

Text 161] Pastimes of the Lord in His Youth 343
TRANSLATION
Refuting the Kazi’s statement, the Lord immediately replied, “The Vedas clearly
enjoin that cows should not be killed. Therefore any Hindu, whoever he may be,
does not indulge in cow killing.
PURPORT
In the Vedic scriptures there are concessions for meat-eaters. It is said that if one
wants to eat meat, he should kill a goat before the goddess Kali and then eat its
meat. Meat-eaters are not allowed to purchase meat or flesh from a market or
slaughterhouse. There are no sanctions for maintaining regular slaughterhouses to
satisfy the tongues of meat-eaters. As far as cow killing is concerned, it is completely
forbidden. Since the cow is considered a mother, how could the Vedas allow cow
killing? Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu pointed out that the Kazi's statement was faulty.
In Bhagavad-gita there is a clear injunction that cows should be protected. /৫ঠ/-
goraksya-vanijyarh vaisya-karma svabhava-jam: ‘The duty of vaisyas is to produce
agricultural products, trade and give protection to cows.’’ (Bg. 18.44) Therefore itis a
false statement that the Vedic scriptures contain injunctions permitting cow killing.

After hearing these statements by ও Caitanya Mahaprabhu, the Kazi, his argu-
ments stunned, could not put forward any more words. Thus, after due considera-
tion, the Kazi accepted defeat and spoke as follows.
PURPORT
In our practical preaching work we meet many Christians who talk about state-
ments of the Bible. When we question whether God is limited or unlimited, Christian
priests say that God is unlimited. But when we question why the unlimited God
should have only one son and not unlimited sons, they are unable to answer.
Similarly, from a scientific point of view, the answers of the Old Testament, New
Testament and Koran to many questions have changed. But a s@stra cannot change
at a person’s whim. All $dstras must be free from the four defects of human nature.
The statements of $dstras must be correct for all time.

TRANSLATION
“My dear Nimai Papdita, what You have said is all true. Our scriptures have de-
veloped only recently, and they are certainly not logical and philosophical.
PURPORT
The $dstras of the yavenas, or meat-eaters, are not eternal scriptures. They have
been fashioned recently, and sometimes they contradict one another. The scriptures
of the yavanas are three: the Old Testament, the New Testament and the Koran.
Their compilation has a history; they are not eternal like the Vedic knowledge.
Therefore although they have their arguments and reasonings, they are not very
sound and transcendental. As such, modern people advanced in science and
philosophy deem these scriptures unacceptable.
Sometimes Christian priests come to us inquiring, ‘Why are our followers neglect-
ing our scriptures and accepting yours?" But when we ask them, “Your Bible says,


--- Page 349 ---
348 ऽन Caitanya-caritamrta [Adi-lila, Ch. 17
‘Do not kill." Why then are you killing so many animals daily?" they cannot answer.
Some of them imperfectly answer that the animals have no souls. But then we ask
them, ‘How do you know that animals have no souls? Animals and children are of
the same nature. Does this mean that the children of human society also have no
souls?” According to the Vedic scriptures, within the body is the owner of the
body, the soul. in Bhagavad-gita it is said:
dehino ‘smin yathd dehe
kaumadrarh yauvanam jara
10100 dehantara-praptir
dhiras tatra na muhyati
‘As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to
old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. The self-realized soul
is not bewildered by such a change.” (৪8. 2.13)

Because the soul is within the body, the body changes through so many forms.
There is a soul within the body of every living entity, whether animal, tree, bird or
human being, and the soul is transmigrating from one type of body to another.
When the scriptures of the yawsnas—namely, the Old Testament, New Testament
and Koran—cannot properly answer inquisitive followers, naturally those advanced
in scientific knowledge and philosophy lose faith in such scriptures. The Kazi
admitted this while talking with Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. The Kazi was a very in-
telligent person. He had full knowledge of his position, as stated in the following verse.

‘“*Vibrating ‘Hari, Hari,” the Hindus make a tumultuous sound. If the king

PURPORT
Pdtasdha refers to the king. Nawab Hussain Shah, whose full name was Ala
Uddina Saiyada Husena Sa, was at that time (1498-1511) the independent King of
Bengal. Formerly he was the servant of the cruel Nawab of the Habst dy nasty named
Mujahphara Khan, but somehow or other he assassinated his master and became the
King. After gaining the throne of Bengal {technically called Masnada), he declared
himself Saiyada Husena Ala Uddina Seripha Mukka. There is a book called Riydja
Us-salatina, whose author, Golama Husena, says that Nawab Hussain Shah belonged
to the family of Mukka Seripha. To keep his family’s glory, he took the name
Seripha Mukka. Generally, however, he is known as Nawab Hussain Shah. After
his death, his eldest son, 14385313153, became King of Bengal (1521-1533). This
King also was very cruel. He committed many atrocities against the Vaisnavas. Asa
result of his sinful activities, one of his servants from the Khoja group killed him
while he was praying in the mosque.

Text 203] Pastimes of the Lord in His Youth 361
PURPORT
Sometimes demoniac nonbelievers, not understanding the potency of the holy
name, make fun of the Vaispavas when the Vaispavas chant the Hare Krsna
mahda-mantra. This joking is also beneficial for such persons. Srimad-Bhagavatam,
Sixth Canto, Second Chapter, verse 14, indicates that the chanting of the Hare
Krsna maha-mantra, even in joking, in the course of ordinary discussion, in indicating
something extraneous, or in negligence, is called ndmabhasa, which is chanting that
is almost on the transcendental stage. This ndmabhdsa stage is better than nama-
aparadha. Namabhasa awakens the supreme remembrance of Lord Vispu. When one
remembers Lord Visnu, he becomes free from material enjoyment. Thus he
gradually comes forward toward the transcendental service of the Lord and becomes
eligible to chant the holy name of the Lord in the transcendental position.

PURPORT

The word pdsandT refers to nonbelievers engaged in fruitive activities and idola-
trous worshipers of many demigods. Pdsangdis do not believe in one God, the
Supreme Personality, Lord Visnu; they think that all the demigods have the same
potency as Him. The definition of a pdsandr is given in the tantra-sastra:

yas tu nardyaparn devari brahma-rudradi-daivataih

samatvenaiva vikseta 50200500017 bhaved dhruvam
“A 60/27 15 one who considers the great demigods such as 1 070 Brahma and Lord
Siva equal to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana.” (Hari-bhakti-
vilasa, 1.73)

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is asarnaurdhva; in other words, no one
can be equal to or greater than Him. But pdsandis do not believe this. They worship
any kind of demigod, thinking it all right to accept whomever they please as the
Supreme Lord. The pasandis were against the Hare Krsna movement of Lord Sri
Krsna Caitanya 31730130817 4, and now we see practically that they also do not like
our humble attempts to spread Krsna consciousness all over the world. On the
contrary, these pdsandis say that we are spoiling the Hindu religion because
people all over the world are accepting Lord Krsna as the Supreme Personality of
Godhead according to the version of Bhagavad-gita As It Is. The pasandis condemn
this movement, and sometimes they accuse Vaisnavas from foreign countries of
being not bona fide. Even so-called Vaisnavas or followers of the Vaisnava cult do
not agree with our activities in making Vaisnavas in the western countries. Such
pasandis existed even during the time of Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and they
still continue to exist. Despite all the activities of these pdsandis, however, the
prediction of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu will triumph: prthivite ache yata nagaradi
grama/ sarvatra pracara haibe mora nama. *'In every town and village, the chanting of
My name will be heard.” No one can check the spread of the Krsna consciousness
movement because upon this movement is the benediction of the Supreme Person-
ality of Godhead, Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu.

PURPORT
In the list of offenses in the chanting of the holy name of the Lord, it is said,
dharma-vrata-tyaga-hutadi-sarva-subha-kriya-samyam api pramadah: to consider the
chanting of the holy name of the Lord equal to the execution of some auspicious
religious ceremony is an offense. According to the materialistic point of view, ob-
serving a religious ceremony invokes an auspicious atmosphere for the material
benefit of the entire world. Materialists therefore manufacture religious principles
to live comfortably and without disturbance in executing their material activities.
Since they do not believe in the existence of God, they have manufactured the idea
that God is impersonal and that to have some conception of God one may imagine
any form. Thus they respect the many forms of the demigods as different represen-
tations or manifestations of the Lord. They are called bahv-i$vara-vadis, or followers
of thousands and thousands of gods. They consider the chanting of the names of the


--- Page 368 ---
Text 212] Pastimes of the Lord in His Youth 367
demigods an auspicious activity. Great so-called svamis have written books saying
that one may chant any name—Durga, Kal7, Siva, Krsna, Rama, and so on—because
any name is all right to invoke an auspicious atmosphere in society. Thus they are
called pdsangdis—unbelievers or faithless demons.

Such pdsandis do not know the actual value of the chanting of the holy name of
Lord Krsna. Foolishly proud of their material birth as brdghmanas and their conse-
quently higher position in the social order, they think of the other classes—namely,
the ksatriyas, the vaisSyas and $adras—as lower classes. According to them, no one
but the brahmanas can chant the holy name of Krsna, for if others chanted the
holy name, its potency would be reduced. They are unaware of the potency of Lord
Krsna’s name. The Brhan-naradiya Purana recommends:

harer nama harer nama harer namaiva kevalam
kalau nasty eva nasty eva nasty eva gatir anyatha
“For spiritual progress in this age of Kali, there is no alternative, no alternative,
no alternative to the holy name, the holy name, the holy name of the Lord." The
pasandis do not accept that the potency of the holy name of Krsna is so great that
one can be delivered simply by chanting the holy name, although this is confirmed
in Srimad-Bhagavatam (12.3.51). Kirtanad eva krspasya mukta-sarigah parari1 vrajet:
any man from any part of the world who practices chanting of the holy name of
Krsna can be liberated and after death go back home, back to Godhead. The rascal
pasandis think that if anyone but a brghmana chants the holy name, the potency of
the holy name is vanquished. According to their judgment, instead of delivering the
fallen souls, the potency of the holy name is reduced. Believing in the existence of
many gods and considering the chanting of the holy name of Krsna no better than
other hymns, these 20544045 do not believe in the words of the $astra (harer nama
harer nama harer namaiva kevalam). But 57 Caitanya Mahaprabhu confirms in His
Siksastaka, kirtaniyaf 5008 harifi: one must chant the holy name of the Lord always,
twenty-four hours a day. The pdsang’is, however, are so fallen and falsely proud of
having taken birth in brghmana families that they think that instead of delivering
all the fallen souls, the holy name becomes impotent when constantly chanted by
lower-class men,

Significant in verse 211 are the words nica 85390 8000 because anyone can join in
the sapkirtana movement, as mentioned in Srimad-Bhagavatam (2.4.18): kirata-
hanandhra-pulinda-pulkasa abhira-Sumbha yavanah khasadayah. This is a list of the
names of candalas. The pasandrs say that when these lower-class men are allowed to
chant, their influence is enhanced. They do not like the idea that others should also
develop spiritual qualities because this would curb their false pride in having taken
birth in families of theelevated brdhmana caste, with a monopoly on spiritual activi-
ties. But despite all protests from so-called Hindus and members of the brahmana
caste, we are propagating the Krsna consciousness movement all over the world,
according to the injunctions of the $dstras and the order of SriCaitanya Mahaprabhu.
Thus we are sure that we are delivering many fallen souls, making them bona fide
candidates for going back home, back to Godhead.

TRANSLATION
‘“*Sir, you are the ruler of this town. Whether Hindu or Moslem, everyone is under

PURPORT
The word thakura has two meanings. One meaning is “God” or "‘a godly person,’
and another meaning is “ksatriya.’* Here the pasapdi brahmapas address the Kazi as
thakura, considering him the ruler of the town. There are different names by which
to address the members of different castes. The brdhmanas are addressed as mahardja,
the ksatriyas as thdkura, the vaiSyas as Setha or mahajana, and the $adras as caudhuri.
This etiquette is still followed in Northern India, where the ksatriyas are addressed
25 Thakura Sahab. The pdsandis went so far as to request the Magistrate, or Kazi, to
have 31 Caitanya Mahaprabhu expelled from the town because of His introducing
hari-nama-sankirtana, Fortunately our Hare Krsna movement all over the world,
especially in the civilized world of Europe and America, has become very popular.
Generally no one complains against us to have us removed from a city. Although
such an attempt was indeed made in Melbourne, Australia, the attempt failed. Thus
we are now introducing this Hare Krsna movement in great cities of the world like
New York, London, Paris, Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne and Aukland, and by the
grace of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu everything is going on nicely. People are happy
to accept the principle of chanting the Hare Krsna mantra, and the result is most
satisfactory.

SYNONYMS
tomdra mukhe—in your mouth; krspa-ndma—chanting of the holy name of Krsna;
e—this; bada—very much; vicitra—wonderful; papa-ksaya—nullifying of sinful activi-
ties; gela—has become a fact; hafla—became; parama—topmost; pavitra—purified.
TRANSLATION
“The chanting of the holy name of Kgsna from your mouth has performed a
wonder —it has nullified the reactions of all your sinful activities. Now you have be-
come supremely pure.
PURPORT
Confirming the potency of the saskirtana movement, these words from the very
mouth of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu express how people can be purified simply by
chanting the holy name of Lord Krsna. The Kazi was a Mohammedan m/eccha, or
meat-eater, but because he several times uttered the holy name of Lord Krsna, auto-
matically the reactions of his sinful life were vanquished, and he was fully purified
of all material contamination. We do not know why the pdsandis of the present day
protest that we are deteriorating the Hindu religion by spreading Krsna conscious-
ness all over the world and claiming all classes of men to the highest standard of
Vaignavism. But these rascals disagree with us so vehemently that some of them do
not allow European and American Vaispavas to enter into the temples of Visnu.
Thinking religion to be meant for material benefit, these so-called Hindus have ac-
tually become vicious by worshiping the numerous forms of the demigods. In the
next verse Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu confirms the Kazi's purification.

TRANSLATION
“Because you have chanted three holy names of the Lord—Hari, Krspa and
Narayana—you are undoubtedly the most fortunate and pious."
PURPORT
Here the Supreme Lord, Sri Caitanya Mahiprabhu, confirms that anyone who
chants the holy names Hari, Krsna and Narayana without offense is certainly ex-
tremely fortunate, and whether Indian or non-Indian, Hindu or non-Hindu, he im-
mediately comes to the level of the most pious personality. We therefore do not
care about the statements of pgsasd7s who protest against our movement's making
the members of other cities or countries into Vaisnavas. We have to follow in the
footsteps of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu, executing our mission peacefully, or, if
necessary, kicking the heads of such protestors.

Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu caused the dead son to speak about knowledge, and
then the two brothers personally became the sons of $rivasa Thakura.
PURPORT
This incident is described as follows by Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura in his
Amrta-praviha-bhasya. One night while 971 Caitanya Mahaprabhu was dancing with
His devotees at the house of Srivasa Thakura, one of Srivasa Thakura’s sons, who
was suffering from some disease, died. Srivasa Thakura was so patient, however,
that he did not allow anyone to express sorrow by crying, for he did not want the
kirtana going on at his house to be disturbed. Thus kirtana continued without a
sound of lamentation. But when the kirtana was over, Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who
could understand the incident, declared, “There must have been some calamity in this
house.” When He was then informed about the death of Srivasa Thakura's son, He


--- Page 377 ---
376 ऽन Caitanya-caritamrta [Adi-Iia, Ch. 17
expressed His regret, saying, “Why was this news not given to Me ০6162” He went
to the place where the son was lying dead and asked him, “My dear boy, why are
you leaving the house of Srivasa Thakura?” The dead son immediately replied, “I
was living in this house as long as | was destined to live here. Now that the time is
over, | am going elsewhere, according to Your direction. | am Your eternal servant,
a dependent living being. | must act only according to Your desire. Beyond Your
desire, | cannot do anything. | have no such power.” Hearing these words of the
dead son, all the members of 517५352 Thakura’s family received transcendental
knowledge. Thus there was no cause for lamentation. This transcendental knowl-
edge is described in Bhagavad-gita (2.13). 70103 dehantara-praptir dhiras tatra na
mubhyati: when someone dies, he accepts another body; therefore sober persons do
not lament. After the discourse between the dead boy and SriCaitanya Mahaprabhu,
funeral ceremonies were performed, and Lord Caitanya assured Srivasa Thakura,
“You have lost one son, but Nityananda Prabhu and | are your eternal sons. We
shall never be able to give up your company.” This is an instance of a transcendental
relationship with Krsna. We have eternal transcendental relationships with Krsna as
His servants, friends, fathers, sons or conjugal lovers. When the same relationships
are pervertedly reflected in this material world, we have relationships as the sons,
fathers, friends, lovers, masters or servants of others, but all these relationships are
subject to termination within a definite period. If we revive our relationship with
Krsna, however, by the grace of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, our eternal relationship
will never break to cause our lamentation.

are motivated by enmity against the Vaisnavas.

to dance, saying, | have seen! | have seen!” He became absorbed in ecstatic love

One who takes the dust of a great personality’s lotus feet transfers his sinful
activities to that great personality. Unless one is very strong, he must suffer the
sinful activities of the person who takes the dust. Therefore ordinarily it should not
be allowed. Sometimes in big meetings people come to take the same advantage by
touching our feet. On account of this, sometimes we have to suffer from some
disease. As far as possible, no outsider should be allowed to touch one’s feet to take
dust from them. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu personally showed this by His example,
as explained in the next verse.

TRANSLATION
Immediately He ran to the River Ganges and jumped in to counteract the sinful
activities of that woman. Lord Nityananda and Haridasa Thakura caught Him and
raised Him from the river.
PURPORT
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is God Himself, but He was playing the part of a
preacher. Every preacher should know that being allowed to touch a Vaisnava’s
feet and take dust may be good for the person who takes it, but it is not good for
the person who allows it to be taken. As far as possible, this practice should
ordinarilv be avoided. Only initiated disciples should be allowed to take this
advantage, not others. Those who are full of sinful activities should generally
be avoided.

PURPORT
\t is said, vaispavera kriyd madha vijiie ng bujhdya: no one can understand the
activities of a pure devotee. A student or neophyte devotee could not possibly
understand why Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu was chanting the name of the 40/75, nor
should the student have asked the Lord about the potency of chanting "9০০7,
407. ** The neophyte student was certainly convinced of the piety in the chanting
of Krsna’s holy name, but this sort of attitude is also offensive. Dharma-vrata-
tyaga-hutadi-sarva-subha-kriya-samyam api pramdda#: to chant the holy name of
Krsna in exchange for the achievement of piety is an offense. This, of course, was
unknown to the student. Thus he innocently asked, “What piety is there in the
chanting of the name 9০721 He did not know that there is no question of piety or
impiety. The chanting of the holy name of Krsna or the holy name 407 is on the
transcendental platform of loving affairs. Since he was not expert in understanding
such transcendental activities, his question was merely impudent. Thus Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu, apparently greatly angry at him, reacted as follows.

TRANSLATION
Hearing the foolish student, the Lord, greatly angry, rebuked Lord Krsna in
various ways. Taking up a stick, He rose to strike the student.
PURPORT
It is mentioned in Srimad-Bhagavatam that when Uddhava came from Lord Krsna
with a message for the 407, all the 4075, especially Srimati Radharani, denounced
Krsna in various ways. Such denunciations, however, reflect an exuberant loving
attitude that an ordinary man cannot understand. When the foolish student ques-
tioned Lord SrT Caitanya Mahaprabhu, Lord Caitanya similarly rebuked Lord Krsna
in loving exuberance. When S17 Caitanya Mahaprabhu was in the mood of the gopis
and the student advocated the cause of Sri Krsna, Lord Caitanya was greatly angry.
Seeing His anger, the foolish student, who was an ordinary atheisticsmadarta-brihmata,
foolishly misjudged Him. Thus he and a party of students were ready to strike the
Lord in retaliation. After this incident, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu decided to take
sannyadsa so that people would not commit offenses against Him, considering Him an
ordinary householder, for in India even now a sannydsr is naturally offered respect.

The brzhmapa student ran to a place where a thousand students were studying
together. There he described the incident to them.
PURPORT
in this verse we find the word dvija, indicating that the student was a bréhmana.
Actually, in those days, only members of the brdhmanpa class became students of
Vedic literature. Schooling is meant especially for brdhmanas; previously there was
no question of schooling for ksatriyas, vaisyas or Siadras. Ksatriyas used to learn the
technology of warfare, and wisyas learned business from their fathers or other
businessmen; they were not meant to study the Vedas. At the present, however,


--- Page 389 ---
388 Si Caitanya-caritamrta [Adi-lila, Ch. 17

everyone goes to school, and everyone is given the same type of education, although
no one knows what the result will be. The result, however, is most unsatisfactory,
as we have seen in the western countries especially. The United States has vast
educational institutions where everyone is allowed to receive an education, but the
resuft is that most students become like hippies.

Higher education is not meant for everyone. Only selected individuals trained in
brahminical culture should be allowed to pursue a higher education. Educational
institutions should not aim to teach technology, for a technologist cannot properly
be called educated. A technologist is a s@dra; only one who studies the Vedas may
properly be called a learned man (017611८) . The duty of a brdhmapa is to become
learned in the Vedic literature and teach the Vedic knowledge to other brahmanas.
In our Krsna consciousness movement we are simply teaching our students to be-
come fit brahmanas and Vaisnavas. In our school at Dallas, the students are learning
English and Sanskrit, and through these two languages they are studying all our
books, such as Srimad-8hagavatam, Bhagavad-gita and Nectar of Devotion. It is a
mistake to educate every student as a technologist. There must be a group of
students who become brdhmanas. Without bradhmanas who study the Vedic literature,
human society will be entirely chaotic.

TRANSLATION
When all the students thus resolved, criticizing $i Caitanya Mahaprabhu, their
intelligence was spoiled. Thus although they were learned scholars, because of this
offense the essence of knowledge was not manifest in them.
PURPORT
In Bhagavad-gita it is said, mayayapahrta-jrand dsurarh bhavam asritah: when,
one becomes inimical to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, adopting an atheistic
attitude (dsurarin bhavam), even if one is a learned scholar the essence of knowledge
does not become manifest in him; in other words, the essence of his knowledge is
stolen by the illusory energy of the Lord. In this connection Sri Bhaktisiddhanta
6३725217 Thikura quotes a mantra from the Svetdsvatara Upanisad:
yasya deve para bhaktir
yatha deve tatha qurau
tasyaite kathita hy arthah
prakasante mahatmanah
The purport of this verse is that one who is unflinchingly devoted to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Visnu, and similarly devoted to the spiritual master, with
no ulterior motive, becomes a master of all knowledge. In the heart of such a
devotee, the real essence of the Vedic knowledge becomes manifest. This essence
is nothing but surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead {vedai$ ८८
sarvair aham eva vedyah). Only unto one who fully surrenders to the spiritual
master and the Supreme Lord does the essence of Vedic knowledge become mani-
fest, not to anyone else. This same principle is emphasized by Sri Prahlada Maharaja
in Srimad-Bhagavatam (7.5.24):
iti purnsarpita vispau
bhaktis cen nava-laksopa
kriyate bhagavaty addha
tan manye 'dhitam uttamam
“A person who directly applies these nine principles hearing, chanting, remember-
ing, etc.] in the service of the Lord is to be understood as a greatly learned man
who has assimilated the Vedic literatures very well, for the goal of studying the
Vedic literature is to understand the supremacy of Lord Sri Krsna.” Sridhara Svami
confirms in his commentary that first one must surrender to the spiritual master;
then the process of devotional service will develop. 1† is not a fact that only one who
diligently pursues an academic career can become a devotee. Even with no academic
career, if one has full faith in the spiritual master and the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, he develops in spiritual life and real knowledge of the Vedas. The
example of Maharaja Khatvanga confirms this. One who surrenders is understood
to have learned the subject matter of the Vedas very nicely. One who adopts this
Vedic process of surrender learns devotional service and is certainly successful. One


--- Page 392 ---
Text 259] Pastimes of the Lord in His Youth 391
who is very much proud, however, is unable to surrender either to the spiritual
master or to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus he cannot understand the
essence of any Vedic literature. §rimad-8hagavatam declares:

Sabda-brahmani nispato
na nispdyat pare yadi
$ramas tasya Srama-phalo
hy adhenum ive raksatah

“If one is learned in Vedic literature but is not a devotee of Lord ৬1500), his work is
a useless waste of labor, just like the keeping of a cow that does not give milk."
(Bhag. 11.11.18)

Anyone who does not follow the surrendering process but is simply interested
in an academic career cannot make any advancement. His profit is only his labor
for nothing. If one is expert in the study of the Vedas but does not surrender to a
spiritual master or Visnu, all his cultivation of knowledge is but a waste of time and
labor.

‘AH the so-called professors and scientists and their students generally follow the
regulative principles of religion, fruitive activities and austerities,” the Lord thought,
“yet at the same time they are blasphemers and rogues.
PURPORT
Here is a depiction of materialists who have no knowledge of devotional service.
They may be very religious and may work very systematically or perform austerities
and penances but if they blaspheme the Supreme Personality of Godhead they are
nothing but rogues. This is confirmed in the Hari-bhakti-sudhoddya (3.11):
bhagavad-bhakti-hinasya
jatih $astrarm japas tapah
apranasyaiva dehasya
mandanari loRa-rafijanam
Without knowledge of devotional service to the Lord, great nationalism, fruitive,
political or social work, science or philosophy are all simply like costly garments
decorating a dead body. The only offense of persons adhering to these principles is
that they are not devotees; they are always blasphemous toward the Supreme
Personality of Godhead and His devotees.

Text 265] Pastimes of the Lord in His Youth 395
PURPORT

Among the members of the varpdsrama institution's social orders (brahmana,
ksatriya, vaiSya and $adra), the brahmana is considered the foremost, for he is the
teacher and spiritual master of all the other varpas. Similarly, among the spiritual
orders (brahmacarya, grhastha, vanaprastha and sannydsa}, the sannydsa order is the
most elevated. Therefore a sannydsi is the spiritual master of all the ৮০/005 and
৫5/70/7705, and a brahmana is also expected to offer obeisances to a sannyasi. Unfor-
tunately, however, caste brahmanas do not offer obeisances to a Vaisnava sannyasi,
They are so proud that they do not offer obeisances even to indian sannyas’s, not to
speak of European and American sannyasrs. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, however, ex-
pected that even the caste brahmanas would offer respectful obeisances to a sannyds?
because five hundred years ago the social custom was to offer obeisances im-
mediately to any 50/77/7051, known or unknown.

The sannydsis of the Krsna consciousness movement are bona fide. All the
students of the Krsna consciousness movement have undergone the regular pro-
cess of initiation. As enjoined in the Hari-bhakti-vi/asa by Sanatana Gosvami, 1010৫
diksg-vidhanena dvijatvar jayate nrpam: by the regular process of initiation, any
man can become a brahmata. Thus in the beginning the students of our Krsna con-
sciousness movement agree to live with devotees, and gradually, having given up
four prohibited activities—illicit sex, gambling, meat-eating and intoxication—they
become advanced in the activities of spiritual life. When one is found to be regularly
following these principles, he is given the first initiation {hari-nama),and he regular-
ly chants at least sixteen rounds a day. Then, after six months or a year, he is
initiated for the second time and given the sacred thread with the regular sacrifice
and rituals. After some time, when he advances still further and is willing to give
up this material world, he is given the sannyasa order. At that time he receives the
title svami or gosvami, both of which mean “master of the senses.” Unfortunately,
debauched so-called brahmanas in India neither offer them respect nor accept them
as bona fide sannyasrs. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu expected the so-called brahmanas
to offer respect to such Vaisnava sannyasis. Nevertheless, it does not matter whether
they offer respect, nor whether they accept these 50/11/2575 as bona fide, for the
$astra describes punishment for such disobedient so-called brahmanas. The sastric
injuction declares:

devata-pratimarh drstva
yatim caive tridandinam
namaskaram na Ruryad yah
prayascittiyate narah
“One who does not offer respect to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, to His
Deity in the temple or to a 40/77 sannyasi must undergo préyascitta {atonement]."
If one does not offer obeisances to such a sannyasi, the prescribed prayascitta is to
fast for one day.

pranatite—by offering obeisances; ha 'be—there will be; jhara—of such offenders;
aparadha—the offenses; ksaya—destruction; nirmala—pure; hrdaye—in the heart;
bhakti—devotional service; kardiba—| shall cause; udaya—the rising.
TRANSLATION
“Offering obeisances will relieve them of all the reactions to their offenses. Then,
by My grace, devotional service [bhakti] will awaken in their pure hearts.
PURPORT
_ According to Vedic injunctions, only a brahmana may be offered sannyasa. The
Sankara-sampradaya {ekadanda-sannyasa-sampraddya) awards the sannydsa order
only to caste brahmanas, os born brahmanas, but in the Vaispava system even one
not born in a brahmana family may be made a brdhmana according to the direction
of the Hari-bhakti-vildsa (tathd diksa-vidhdnena dvijatvam jayate nrpam). Any person
from any part of the world may be made a brahmapa by the regular process of
initiation, and when he follows brakminical behavior, observing the principle of
abstaining from intoxication, illicit sex, meat-eating and gambling, he may be
offered sannydsa. All the sannyasis in the Kgsna consciousness movement, who are
preaching all over the world, are regular brahmana-sannydsis. Thus the so-called
caste brahmanas should not object to offering them respectful obeisances. By
offering such obeisances, as recommended by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, they will
diminish their offenses and automatically awaken to their natural position of de-
votional service. As it is said, nitya-siddha krsna-prema sadhya kabhu naya: krsna-
prema can be awakened in a purified heart. The more we offer obeisances to
sannyasrs, especially Vaispava sannydsis, the more we diminish our offenses and
purify our hearts. Only in a purified heart can krspa-prema awaken. This is the
process of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s cult, the Krspa consciousness movement.

PURPORT
According to the system of Vedic society, whenever an unknown sannydsi comes
to a village or town, someone must invite him to take prasdda in his home. Sannydsis
generally take prasdda in the house of a br@dhmapa because the brdhmana worships
the Lord Narayana $i/d, or $alagrama-sila, and therefore there is prasdda that the
sannydsi may take. Kesava Bharati accepted the invitation of Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu. Thus the Lord had a good opportunity to explain His desire to take
sannydsa from him.

TRANSLATION

After saying this, Kedava Bharati, the spiritual master, went back to his village,
Katwa. Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu went there and accepted the renounced order
of life [52009352] .

PURPORT

At the end of His twenty-fourth year, at the end of the fortnight of the waxing
moon, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu left Navadvipa and crossed the River Ganges at a
place known as Nidayara-ghata. Then He reached Kantaka-nagara, or Katoya
(Katwa), where He accepted ekadangda-sannydsa according to the Sarikarite system.
Since Ke$ava 8131217 belonged to the Sarikarite sect, he could notaward the Vaignava
sannydsa order, whose members carry the tridagda.

Candrasekhara Acarya assisted in the routine ceremonial work of the Lord's
acceptance of sannydsa. By the order of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, kirtana was per-
formed for the entire day, and at the end of the day the Lord shaved off His hair.
On the next day He became a regular sannydsi, with one rod (ekadarida). From that
day on, His name was 5r Krsna Caitanya. Before that, He was known as Nimai
Pandita. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, in the sannydsa order, traveled all over the
Radhadesa, the region where the Ganges River cannot be seen. Kesava Bharati
accompanied Him for some distance.

loving affairs between Radharani and Krsna; asvadite—to taste; radha-bhava—

TRANSLATION
To taste the mellow quality of Srimati Radharani’s loving affairs in Her relation-
ship with Ksna, and to understand the reservoir of pleasure in 10093, Krsna Himself,
as SrT Caitanya Mahaprabhu, accepted the mood of Radharani.
PURPORT
In this connection Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura writes in his
Anubhdsya, "917 Gaurasundara is Krsna Himself with the attitude of Srimati
Radharani. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu never gave up the attitude of the 4०75. He
remained everlastingly predominated by Krsna and never accepted the part of the
predominator by imitating conjugal love with an ordinary woman, as sahajiyas
generally do. He never placed Himself in the position of a debauchee. Lusty
materialists like the members of the sahagjiya-sampraddya hanker after women,
even others’ wives. But when they try to ascribe the responsibility for their lusty
activities to Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, they become offenders to ५५7५0०१ Damodara
and Srila Vrndavana dasa Thakura. In Sr7 Caitanya-bhagavata, Adi-khapga, Chapter
Fifteen, it is said:
sabe para-strira prati nghi parihdsa
stri dekhi' dire prabhu hayena eka-pasa
‘Sri Caitanya 14317301380 never even joked with others’ wives. As soon 25 He saw a
woman coming, He would immediately give her ample room to pass without talking.
He was extremely strict regarding the association of women. The sahajiyds, however,
pose as followers of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, although they indulge in lusty
affairs with women. In His youth Lord Caitanya was very humorous with everyone,
but He never joked with any woman, nor in this incarnation did He talk about
women. The gauranga-nagari party is not approved by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu or

402 छन Caitanya-caritamsta [Adi-lila, Ch. 17
Vrndavana dasa Thakura. Even though one may offer all kinds of prayers to
Caitanya Mahaprabhu, one should strictly avoid worshiping Him as the Gaurariga
Nagara. The personal behavior of Sri Caitanya Mah@prabhu and the verses written
by Sri Vrndavana dasa Thakura have completely repudiated the lusty desires of the
gauranga-nagaris. **

original form of Lord Krsna as the son of Nanda Maharaja. The wonderful feelings
of the gopis in ecstatic parama-rasa with Krsna are the greatest mystery in spiritual
life.”

is the wonderful glory of Her love.”

PURPORT
In verses 296 through 301 the emotional devoted service of Sri Nityananda
and Sri Advaita Prabhu has been fully described. Describing such individual service,
the Gauwra-gapoddesa-dipika, verses 11 through 16, declares that although Lord


--- Page 414 ---
Text 303] Pastimes of the Lord in His Youth 413
Caitanya Mahaprabhu appeared as a devotee, He is none other than the son of
Nanda Maharaja. Similarly, aithough Sri Nityananda Prabhu appeared as Lord
Caitanya’s assistant, He is none other than Baladeva, the carrier of the plow. Advaita
Acarya is the incarnation of Sadasiva from the spiritual world. All the devotees
headed by Srivasa Thakura are His marginal energy, whereas the devotees headed
by Gadadhara Pandita are manifestations of His internal potency.

Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, Advaita Prabhu and Nityananda Prabhu all belong to
the vispu-tattva category. Because Lord Caitanya is an ocean of mercy, He is
addressed as mahaprabhu, whereas Nityananda and Advaita, being two great
personalities who assist Lord Caitanya, are addressed as prabhu. Thus there are
two prabhus and one mahaprabhu. Gadadhara Gosvami is a representative of a
perfect br@hmanpa spiritual master. Srivasa Thakura represents a perfect brahmana
devotee. These five are known as the Panca-tattva.

dictory; acintya—inconceivable; caritra—character; prabhura—of the Lord; ati—

TRANSLATION
He is Krsna, yet He has accepted the mood of the gopis. How is it so? 1015 the
inconceivable character of the Lord, which is very difficult to understand.
PURPORT
Krsna's accepting the part of the 90215 is certainly contradictory according to
any mundane calculations, but the Lord, by His inconceivable character, may act
like the 405 and feel separation from Krsna, although He is Krsna Himself. Such a
contradiction can be reconciled only in the Supreme Personality of Godhead
because He has energy that is inconceivable (acintya), which can make possible that
which is impossible to do (agatdn gatdn patiyasi). Such contradictions are very
difficult to understand unless a devotee strictly follows the Vaisnava philosophy
under the direction of the Gosvamis. Therefore Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami ends
every chapter with this verse:
Sri-rupa-raghundtha-pade ydra asa
caitanya-caritamrta kahe krspadasa
“Praying at the lotus feet of Sri Rupa and Sri Raghunatha, always desiring their
mercy, |, Krsnadasa, narrate Sri Caitanya-caritamrta, following in their footsteps.”
10 a song by Narottama dasa Thakura it is stated:
rapa-raghunatha-pade ha-ibe kuti
kabe hama bujhaba se yugala-piriti
The conjugal love between Radha and Krsna, which is called yugala-piriti, is not
understandable by mundane scholars, artists or poets. It is simply to be understood


--- Page 416 ---
Text 306] Pastimes of the Lord in His Youth 415
by devotees who strictly follow in the footsteps of the six Gosvamis. Sometimes
so-called artists and poets try to undesstand the love affairs of Radha and Krsna,
and they publish cheap books of poetry and pictures on the subject. Unfortunately,
however, they do not understand the transcendental affairs of Radha and Krsna
even to the smallest degree. They are simply meddling in a matter in which they are
not fit even to enter.

contradictions are possible.

(5.26.13), wherein it is said that a person who cooks living birds and beasts to
satisfy his tongue is brought before Yamarzja after death and punished in the
Kumbhipaka hell. There he is put into boiling oil cailed kumbhi-paka, from which
there is no deliverance. Kumbhipaka is meant for persons who are unnecessarily
envious. Those who are envious of the activities of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu are
punished in that hellish condition.
