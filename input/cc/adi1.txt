Preface

There is no difference between the teachings of Lord Caitanya presented here and
the teachings of Lord Krsna in Bhagavad-gita. The teachings of Lord Caitanya are
practical demonstrations of Lord Krsna’s teachings. Lord Krsna’s ultimate instruc-
tion in Bhagavad-gitd is that everyone should surrender unto Him, Lord Krsna. Krsna
promises to take immediate charge of such a surrendered soul. The Lord, the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, is already in charge of the maintenance of this
creation by virtue of His plenary expansion, Ksirodakasayi Visnu, but this main-
tenance is not direct. However, when the Lord says that He takes charge of His
pure devotee, He actually takes direct charge. A pure devotee is a soul who is
forever surrendered to the Lord, just as a child is surrendered to his parents or an
animal to its master. In the surrendering process, one should: (1) accept things
favorable for discharging devotional service, (2) reject things unfavorable, (3) believe
firmly in the Lord's protection, (4) feel exclusively dependent on the mercy of the
Lord, (5) have no interest separate from the interest of the Lord, and (6) always
feel oneself meek and humble.

The Lord demands that one surrender unto Him by following these six guide-
lines, but the unintelligent so-called scholars of the world misunderstand these
demands and urge the general mass of people to reject them. At the conclusion of
the Ninth Chapter of Bhagavad-gita, Lord Krsna directly says: “Engage your mind
always in thinking of Me, offer obeisances and worship Me. Being completely
absorbed in Me, surely you will come to Me.” (Bg. 9.34) However, the scholarly
demons misguide the masses of people by directing them to the impersonal,
unmanifest, eternal, unborn truth rather than the Personality of Godhead. The
impersonalist Mayavadi philosophers do not accept that the ultimate aspect of the
Absolute Truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If one desires to understand
the sun as it is, one must first face the sunshine, then the sun globe and, after
entering into that globe, come face to face with the predominating deity of the sun.
Due to a poor fund of knowledge, the Mayavadi philosophers cannot go beyond the
Brahman effulgence, which may be compared to the sunshine. The Upanisads
confirm that one has to penetrate the dazzling effulgence of Brahman before one
can see the real face of the Personality of Godhead.

Lord Caitanya therefore teaches direct worship of Lord Krsna, who appeared as
the foster child of the King of Vraja. He also suggests that the place known as
Vindavana is as good as Lord Krsna because there is no difference between the
name, quality, form, pastimes, entourage and paraphernalia of Lord Krsna and
Lord Krsna Himself. That is the absolute nature of the Absolute Truth.

Lord Caitanya also recommended that the highest mode of worship in the
highest perfectional stage is the method practiced by the damsels of Vraja. These
damsels (gopTs, or cowherd girls) simply loved Krsna without a motive for material
or spiritual gain. Caitanya also recommended Srimad-Bhagavatam as the spotless
narration of transcendental knowledge, and He pointed out that the highest goal in

human life is to develop unalloyed love for Krsna, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead.

Lord Caitanya’s teachings are identical to those given by Lord Kapila, the original
propounder of sarikhya-yoga, the sarikhya system of philosophy. This authorized
system of yoga recommends meditation on the transcendental form of the Lord.
There is no question of meditating on something void or impersonal. One can
meditate on the transcendental form of Lord Visnu even without practicing involved
sitting postures. Such meditation is called perfect samadhi. This perfect samadhi is
verified at the end of the Sixth Chapter of Bhagavad-gitd where Lord Krsna says:
“And of all yogis, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in
transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the
highest of all.” (Bg. 6.47)

Lord Caitanya instructed the mass of people in the sarikhya philosophy of acintya-
bhedabheda-tattva, which maintains that the Supreme Lord is simultaneously one
with and different from His creation. Lord Caitanya taught this philosophy through
the chanting of the holy name of the Lord. He taught that the holy name of the
Lord is the sound incarnation of the Lord and that since the Lord is the absolute
whole, there is no difference between His holy name and His transcendental form.
Thus by chanting the holy name of the Lord one can directly associate with the
Supreme Lord by sound vibration. As one practices this sound vibration, he passes
through three stages of development: the offensive stage, the clearing stage and the
transcendental stage. In the offensive stage one may desire all kinds of material
happiness, but in the second stage one becomes clear of all material contamination.
When one is situated on the transcendental stage, he attains the most coveted
position—the stage of loving God. Lord Caitanya taught that this is the highest
stage of perfection for human beings.

Yoga practice is essentially meant for controlling the senses. The central control
ling factor of all the senses is the mind; therefore one first has to practice controlling
the mind by engaging it in Krsna consciousness. The gross activities of the mind are
expressed through the external senses either for the acquiring of knowledge or the
functioning of the senses in accordance to the will. The subtle activities of the mind
are thinking, feeling and willing. In accordance to one’s consciousness, the indi-
vidual is either polluted or clear. If one’s mind is fixed on Krsna (His name, quality,
form, pastimes, entourage and paraphernalia), all one’s activities—both subtle and
gross—become favorable. The Bhagavad-gita’s process of purifying consciousness is
the process of fixingone’s mind on Krsna by talking of His transcendental activities,
cleansing His temple, going to His temple, seeing the beautiful transcendental form
of the Lord nicely decorated, hearing His transcendental glories, tasting food
offered to Him, associating with His devotees, smelling the flowers and 14/05
leaves offered Him, engaging in activities for the Lord’s interest, etc. No one can
bring the activities of the mind and senses to a stop, but one can purify these
activities through a change in consciousness. This change is indicated in Bhagavad-
gita when Krsna tells Arjuna of the knowledge of yoga whereby one can work
without fruitive results. “0 son of Prth3, when you act by such intelligence, you


--- Page 3 ---
Preface xi
can free yourself from the bondage of works,” (Bg. 2.39) A human being is some-
times restricted in sense gratification due to certain circumstances such as disease,
etc., but this is not the prescription. Without knowing the actual process by which
the mind and senses can be controlled, less intelligent men either try to stop the
mind and senses by force, or they give in to them and are carried away by the waves
of sense gratification.

The regulative principles and the rules of yoga, the various sitting postures and
breathing exercises performed in an attempt to withdraw one’s senses from the
sense objects are methods meant for those who are too much engrossed in the
bodily conception of life. The intelligent man who is situated in Krsna consciousness
does not try to forcibly stop his senses from acting. Rather, he engages his senses in
the service of Krsna. No one can stop a child from playing by leaving him inactive.
A child can be stopped from engaging in nonsense by being engaged in superior
activities. The forceful restraint of sense activities by the eight principles of yoga is
recommended for inferior men. Being engaged in the superior activities of Krsna
consciousness, superior men naturally retire from the inferior activities of material
existence.

In this way Lord Caitanya teaches the science of Krsna consciousness. That
science is absolute. Dry mental speculators try to restrain themselves from material
attachment, but it is generally found that the mind is too strong to be controlled
and that it drags them down to sensual activities. A person in Krsna consciousness
does not run this risk. One has to engage his mind and senses in Krsna conscious
activities, and Lord Caitanya teaches one how to do this in practice. Before accepting
sannydsa (the renounced order), Lord Caitanya was known as Vi§vambhara. The
word viSvambhara refers to one who maintains the entire universe and who leads
all living entities. This maintainer and leader appeared as Lord Sri Krsna Caitanya
to give humanity these sublime teachings. Lord Caitanya is the ideal teacher of life’s
prime necessities. He is the most munificent bestower of love of Krsna. He is the
complete reservoir of all mercies and good fortune. As confirmed in Srimad-
Bhagavatam, Bhagavad-gitd, Mahabharata and the Upanisads, He is the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Krsna Himself, and He is worshipable by everyone in this
age of disagreement. Everyone can join in His sarikiftana movement. No previous
qualification is necessary. Just by following His teachings, anyone can become a
perfect human being. If one is fortunate enough to be attracted by His features, one
is sure to be successful in one’s life mission. In other words, those who are interested
in attaining spiritual existence can be easily relieved from the clutches of mdya by
the grace of Lord Caitanya. These teachings presented in this book are nondifferent
from the Lord.

Being engrossed in the material body, the conditioned soul increases the pages of
history by all kinds of material activities. The teachings of Lord Caitanya can help
human society stop such unnecessary and temporary activities. By these teachings,
humanity can be elevated to the topmost platform of spiritual activity. These
spiritual activities actually begin after liberation from material bondage. Such
liberated activities in Krsna consciousness constitute the goal of human perfection.

The false prestige one acquires by attempting to dominate material nature is illusory.
Illuminating knowledge can be acquired from the teachings of Lord Caitanya, and
by such knowledge one can advance in spiritual existence.

Everyone has to suffer or enjoy the fruits of his activity; no one can check the
laws of material nature which govern such things. As long as one is engaged in
fruitive activity, he is sure to be baffled in an attempt to attain the ultimate goal of
life. | sincerely hope that by understanding the teachings of Lord Caitanya, human
society will experience a new light of spiritual life which will open the field of
activity for the pure soul.

Introduction

(Originally delivered as five morning lectures on Caitanya-caritimrta—the
authoritative biography of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu by Krsnadasa Kaviraja
Gosvami—before the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, New York
City, April 10-14, 1967)

The word caitanya means living force. As living entities, we can move, but a table
cannot because it does not possess living force. Movement and activity may be con-
sidered to be signs or symptoms of the living force. Indeed, it may be said that there
can be no activity without the living force. Although the living force is present in
the material condition, it is not amrta, immortal. The words caitanya-caritamita,
then, may be translated as “106 character of the living force in immortality.”

But how is this living force displayed immortally? It is not displayed by man or
any other creature in this material universe, for none of us are immortal in these
bodies. We possess the living force, we perform activities, and we are immortal by
our nature and constitution, but the material condition into which we have been
put does not allow our immortality to be displayed. It is stated in the Katha
Upanisad that eternality and the living force belong both to ourselves and God.
Although this is true in that both God and ourselves are immortal, there is a
difference. As living entities, we perform many activities, but we have a tendency to
fall down into material nature. God has no such tendency. Being all-powerful, He
never comes under the control of material nature. Indeed, material nature is but one
display of His inconceivable energies.

On the ground we may see only clouds in the sky, but if we fly above the clouds
we can see the sun shining. From the sky, skyscrapers and cities seem very tiny;
similarly, from God's position this entire material creation is insignificant. The
tendency of the conditioned living entity is to come down from the heights where
everything can be seen in perspective. God, however, does not have this tendency.
The Supreme Lord is not subject to fall down into illusion (maya) any more than
the sun issubject to fall beneath the clouds. Because the Supreme Lord is not subject
to illusion, He is unconditioned; because we, as finite living entities, are prone to
fall into illusion, we are called conditioned. Impersonalist philosophers (Mayavadis)
maintain that both the living entity and God Himself are under the control of maya
when they come into this material world. This may be true of the living entity, but
it is not true of God, for in all instances the material energy is working under His
direction. Those who consider the Supreme Lord to be subject to material con-
ditioning are called fools by Krsna Himself in Bhagavad-gita:

avajananti mam magha
manugim tanum asritam
pararii bhavam ajananto
mama bhiita-mahesvaram
1


--- Page 6 ---

“Fools deride Me when | descend in the human form. They do not know My
transcendental nature and My supreme dominion over all that be.” (Bg. 9.11)

Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu should not be considered to be one of us. He is Krsna
Himself, the supreme living entity, and as such He never comes under the cloud of
maya. Kggna, His expansions, and even His higher devotees never fall into the
clutches of illusion. Lord Caitanya came to earth simply to preach krsna-bhakti,
love of Krsna. In other words, He is Lord Krsna Himself teaching the living entities
the proper way to approach Krsna. He is like a teacher who, seeing a student doing
poorly, takes up a pencil and writes, saying, “Do it like this: A, B, C.” By this, one
must not foolishly think that the teacher is learning his ABC's. Although He appears
in the guise of a devotee, we should always remember that Lord Caitanya is Krsna
(God) Himself teaching us how to become Krsna conscious, and we must study Him
in that light.

In Bhagavad-gita Lord Kgsna sets forth the highest religious principle in this way:

sarva-dharman parityajya
mam ekarn Saranarh vraja
aha tvarn sarva-papebhyo
moksayisyami ma Sucah
“Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. | shall deliver you
from all sinful reaction. Do not fear.” (Bg. 18.66)

This may seem to be a simple instruction to follow, but invariably our reaction
is, “Oh, surrender? Give up? But | have so many responsibilities.” And maya,
illusion, says to us, “Don’t do it, or you'll be out of my clutches. Just stay in my
clutches, and I'll kick you.” It is a fact that we are constantly being kicked by
maya, just as the male-ass is kicked in the face by the she-ass when he comes for sex.
Similarly, cats and dogs are always fighting and whining when they have sex. These
are the tricks of nature. Even an elephant in the jungle is caught by the use of a
trained she-elephant who leads him into a pit. Maya has many activities, and in the
material world her strongest shackle is the female. Of course in actuality we are
neither male nor female—for these designations refer only to the outer dress, the
body. We are all actually Krsna's servants. In conditioned life, however, we are
shackled by the iron chains which take the form of beautiful women. Thus every
male is bound by sex life, and therefore when one attempts to gain liberation from
the material clutches, he must first learn to control the sex urge. Unrestricted sex puts
one fully in the clutches of illusion. Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu officially renounced
this illusion at the age of twenty-four, although His wife was sixteen and His mother
seventy, and He was the only male member of the family. Although He was a
brahmana and was not rich, He took sannydsa, the renounced order of life, and thus
extricated Himself from family entanglement.

If we wish to become fully Krsna conscious, we have to give up the shackles of
maya, or, if we remain with maya, we should live in such a way that we will not be
subject to illusion. It is not necessary for one to abandon his family, for there were
many householders amongst Lord Caitanya’s closest devotees. What must be re-


--- Page 7 ---
Introduction 3
nounced is the propensity for material enjoyment. Although Lord Caitanya
approved of a householder having regulated sex in marriage, He was very strict with
those in the renounced order, and He even banished Junior Haridasa for glancing
lustfully at a young woman. The point is that one must take up a particular path
andstick to it, obeying all the rules and regulations necessary for success in spiritual
life. It was Lord Caitanya’s mission that He teach the path of Krsna consciousness
to all men and thereby enable them to partake of the immortality of spiritual life.

From Caitanya-caritamgta we learn how Caitanya taught people to become im-
mortal, and thus the title may be properly translated 25 ‘‘the immortal character of
the living force.” The supreme living force is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
He is also the supreme entity. There are innumerable living entities, and all of them
are individual. This is very easy to understand: We are all individual in thought and
desires, and the Supreme Lord is also an individual person. He is different, though,
in that He is the leader, the one whom no one can excel. Amongst the created living
entities, one being can excel another in one capacity or another. The Lord is an
individual, just as the living entities are individual, but He is different in that He is
the supreme individual. God is also infallible, and in Bhagavad-gita He is addressed
as Acyuta, which means, ‘““He who never falls down.” This is indicated because in
Bhagavad-gita Arjuna had fallen into delusion but Krsna had not. We often hear it
said that God is infallible, and in Bhagavad-gita Krsna states:

nanyarn gunebhyah kartararn
yada drastanupasyati
gunebhyas ca param vetti
mad-bhavarn so 'dhigacchati
“When you see that there is nothing beyond these modes of nature in all activities
and that the Supreme Lord is transcendental to all these modes, then you can
know My spiritual nature.” (Bg. 14.19)

Thus we should not think that Krsna is overpowered by the material potency
when He is in the material world. Krsna and His incarnations are not under the
control of material nature. They are totally free. Indeed, in Srimad-Bhagavatam
one who has a godly nature is actually defined as one who is not affected by the
modes of material nature, although in material nature. If even a devotee can attain
this freedom, then what to speak of the Supreme?

The real question is how can we remain unpolluted by material contamination
while in the material world. It was RGpa Gosvami who explained that we can remain
uncontaminated while in the world if we simply make it our ambition to serve
Krsna. One may then justifiably ask, “How can | serve?” Obviously this is not simply
a matter of meditation, which is just an activity of the mind, but of practical work.
Love of Krgna's service can only be attained by working for Krsna. In such work,
we should leave no resource unused. Whatever is there, whatever we have, should
be used for Krgna. We can use everything: typewriters, automobiles, airplanes,
missiles—anything. If we simply speak to people about Krsna consciousness, we are
also rendering service. If our minds, senses, speech, money and energies are thus


--- Page 8 ---

engaged in the service of Krsna, we cannot be considered to be existing in material
nature. By virtue of spiritual consciousness, or Krsna consciousness, we transcend
the platform of material nature. It is a fact that Krsna, His expansions and His
devotees—that is, those who work for Him—are not in material nature, although
people with a poor fund of knowledge think that they are.

Caitanya-caritamrta teaches that the spirit soul is immortal and that our activities in
the spiritual world are also immortal. The Mayavadis, who hold to the view that the
Absolute is impersonal and formless, contend that a realized soul has no need to
talk. However, the Vaisnavas, who are devotees of Krsna, contend that when one
reaches the stage of realization, he really begins to talk. “Previously we only talked
of nonsense,” the Vaispava says. ‘Now let us begin our real talks, talks of Krsna."
The Mayavadis are also fond of using the example of the water pot, maintaining
that when a pot is not filled with water it makes a sound, but that when it is filled
it makes no sound. But are we waterpots? How can we be compared to them? A
good analogy utilizes as many similarities between two objects as possible. A water
pot is not an active living force, but we are. Ever silent meditation may be adequate
for a water pot, but not for us. Indeed, when one has realized he has so much to
say about Krsna, twenty-four hours in a day is not sufficient. It is the fool who is
celebrated as long as he does not speak, for when he breaks his silence his lack of
knowledge is exposed. Caitanya-caritamrta shows that there are many wonderful
things to discover by glorifying the Supreme.

In the beginning of Caitanya-caritamrta, Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami writes: “1
offer my respects to my spiritual masters.” He uses the plural here to indicate the
disciplic succession. It is not that he offers obeisances to his spiritual master alone
but to the whole parampara, the chain of disciplic succession beginning with Lord
Krsna Himself. Thus the guru is addressed in the plural to show the author’s
highest respect for all the Vaispavas. After offering obeisances to the disciplic
succession, the author pays obeisances to all other devotees, Godbrothers, the
expansions of Godhead and the first manifestation of Krsna’s energy. Lord Caitanya
Mahaprabhu (sometimes called Krsna Caitanya) is the embodiment of all of these;
He is God, guru, devotee and the expansion of God. As His associate, Nityananda,
He is the first manifestation of energy; as Advaita, He is an incarnation; as
Gadadhara, He is the internal potency; and as Srivasa, He is the marginal living
entity. Thus Krsna should not be thought of as being alone but should be considered
as eternally existing with all His manifestation, as described by Ramanujacarya. In
visSistadwaita philosophy, God's energies, expansions and incarnations are considered
to be oneness in diversity. In other words, God is not separate from all of these;
everything together is God. ॥

Actually Caitanya-caritamrta is not intended for the novice, for it is the post-
graduate study of spiritual knowledge. Ideally, one begins with Bhagavad-gita and
advances through Srimad-Bhagavatam to the Caitanya-caritamrta. Although all
these great scriptures are on the same absolute level, for the sake of comparative
study Caitanya-caritamrta is considered to be on the highest platform. Every verse
in it is perfectly composed. Indeed, Lord Caitanya and Nityananda are compared

Introduction (1
to the sun and moon in that They dissipate the darkness of the material world. In
this instance both the sun and moon have risen together, and it is proper to offer
obeisances directly to Lord Caitanya and Nityananda.

In the Western world where the glories of Lord Caitanya are relatively unknown,
one may inquire, “Who is Krsna Caitanya?'’ The scriptural conclusion in answer to
that question is that He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Generally in the
Upanigads the Supreme Absolute Truth is described in an impersonal way, but the
personal aspect of the Absolute Truth is mentioned in the Sopanisad, where, after
a description of the all-pervading, we find the following verse:

hiranmayena patrena
satyasyapihitarn mukham

tat tvam pasann apavinu
satya-dharmaya drstaye

“O my Lord, sustainer of all that lives, Your real face is covered by Your
dazzling effulgence. Kindly remove that covering and exhibit Yourself to Your pure
devotee.” (57 [Sopanisad, Mantra 15)

The impersonalists do not have the power to go beyond the effulgence of God
and arrive at the personality from whom this effulgence is emanating. At the end
of Sopanisad, however, there is a hymn to the Personality of Godhead. It is not that
the impersonal Brahman is denied; it is also described, but that Brahman is con-
sidered to be the glaring effulgence of the body of Caitanya. In other words, Krsna
Caitanya is the basis of the impersonal Brahman. It is also stated by Krsna in
Bhagavad-gita that the impersonal Brahman rests on Him (brahmano hi pratisthaham,
Bg. 14.27). The Paramatma, or Supersoul, which is present within the heart of
every living entity and within every atom of the universe, is but the partial repre-
sentation of Caitanya. Krsna Caitanya is therefore the basis of Brahman and the
Supreme Personality of Godhead as well. As the Supreme He is full in six opulences:
wealth, fame, strength, beauty, knowledge and renunciation. In short, we should
know that He is Krsna, God, and nothing is equal to or greater than Him. There is
no superior to be conceived. He is the Supreme Person.

It was Ripa Gosvami, a confidential devotee taught for more than ten days
continuously by Lord Caitanya, who wrote:

namo maha-vadanyaya Rrsna-prema-pradaya te

krsndya krspa-caitanya-namne gaura-tvise namah
“I offer my respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Lord Sri Krsna Caitanya
who is more magnanimous than any other avatara, even Krsna Himself, because He
is bestowing freely what no one else has ever given—pure love of Krsna.”

It is not that Caitanya teaches a long and elaborate path to God realization. He
iscompletely spiritual, and He begins from the point of surrender to Krsna. He does
not pursue the paths of karma-yoga or jfigna-yoga or hatha-yoga but begins at the


--- Page 10 ---
6

end of material existence, at the point where one gives up all material attachment.
In Bhagavad-gita Krsna began His teachings by distinguishing the soul from matter
and in the Eighteenth Chapter concluded at the point where the soul surrenders to
Him in devotion. The Mayavadis would have all talk cease there, but at that point
the real discussion only begins. It is the Vedanta-siitra which begins: athato brahma-
jijaasa: “Now let us begin to inquire about the Supreme Absolute Truth.” Ripa
Gosvami thus praises Caitanya as the most munificent incarnation of all, for He gives
the greatest gift by indicating the highest form of devotional service. In other words,
He answers the most important inquiries that anyone can make.

There are different stages of devotional service and God realization. Strictly
speaking, anyone who accepts the existence of God is situated in devotional
service. To acknowledge that God is great is something, but not much. Caitanya,
preaching as an d@carya, a great teacher, taught that we can enter into a relationship
with God and actually become God's friend. In Bhagavad-gita Krsna showed Arjuna
His universal form because Arjuna was His “very dear friend.” Upon seeing Krsna as
the Lord of the universes, however, Arjuna actually asked Krsna to forgive the
familiarity of his friendship. Caitanya goes beyond this point. Through Lord
Caitanya we can become friends with Krsna, and there is no limit to this friendship.
We can become friends of Krsna not in awe or adoration but in complete freedom.
We can even relate to God as His father. This is not only the philosophy of Caitanya-
caritamgta but of Srimad-Bhagavatam as well. There are no other literatures in
the world in which God is treated as the son of a devotee. Usually God is seen as
the almighty Father who supplies the demands of His sons. The great devotees,
however, sometimes treat God as a son in their execution of devotional service.
The son demands, and the father supplies, and in supplying Krsna the devotee
becomes like a father. Instead of taking from God, we give to God. It was in this
relationship that Krsna's mother, Yasoda, told the Lord, “Here, eat this or You'll
die. Eat nicely.” In this way Krsna, although the proprietor of everything, depends
on the mercy of His devotee. This is a uniquely high level of friendship in which the
devotee actually believes himself to be the father of Krsna.

However, Lord Caitanya’s greatest gift was His teaching that Krsna can be actually
treated as one’s lover. In this relationship the Lord is so much attached that He
expresses His inability to reciprocate. Krsna was so obliged to the 40/05, the cowherd
girls of Vrndavana, that He felt unable to return their love. “I cannot repay your
love,” He told them. “I have no more assets to return.” Thus devotional service is
performed on this excellent platform, and knowledge of the devotees relationship
to Krsna as lover and beloved was given by Caitanya Mahaprabhu. It was never
given by any previous incarnation or dcarya. Thus ९२००३ Gosvami wrote of Caitanya:
“Devotional service itself is the highest platform, the glorious platform which You
have contributed. You are Krsna in a yellow complexion, and You are Sactnandana,
the son of mother ৩30. Those who hear Caitanya-caritamyta will keep You in their
hearts. It will be easy to understand Krsna through You.” Thus Caitanya Mahaprabhu
came to deliver Krsna. His method of deliverance was not meditation, fruitive
activities or scriptural study, but love.

Introduction 7

We have often heard the phrase “love of Godhead.” How far this love of Godhead
can actually be developed can be learned from the Vaisnava philosophy. Theoretical
knowledge of love of God can be found in many places and in many scriptures, but
what that love of Godhead actually is and how it is developed can be found in
Vaignava literatures. It is the unique and highest development of love of God that
is given by Caitanya Mahaprabhu.

Even in this material world we can have a little sense of love. How is this possible?
It is due to the love which is found in the Godhead. Whatever we find within our
experience within this conditional life is situated in the Supreme Lord, who is the
ultimate source of everything. In our original relationship with the Supreme Lord
there is real love, and that love is reflected pervertedly through material conditions.
Our real love is continuous and unending, but because that love is reflected per-
vertedly in this material world, it lacks continuity and is inebriating. If we want
real transcendental love, we have to transfer our love to the supreme lovable object—
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the basic principle of Krsna con-
sciousness.

In material consciousness we are trying to love that which is not at all lovable. We
give our love to dogs and cats, running the risk that at the time of death we may
think of them and consequently take birth in a family of cats or dogs. Thus love
that does not have Krsna as its object leads downward. It is not that Krsna or God
is something obscure or something that only a few chosen people can attain.
Caitanya Mahaprabhu informs us that in every country and in every scripture there
is some hint of love of Godhead. Unfortunately no one knows what love of God-
head actually is. The Vedic scriptures, however, are different in that they can
direct the individual in the proper way to love God. Other scriptures do not give
information on how one can love God, nor do they actually define or describe
what or who the Godhead actually is. Although they officially promote love of
Godhead, they have no idea how to execute it. But Caitanya Mahaprabhu gives a
practical demonstration of how to love God in a conjugal relationship. Taking the
part of Radharani, Caitanya tries to love Krsna 25 Radharani loved Him. Krsna was
always amazed by Radharani’s love. “How does Radharani give Me such pleasure?”
He would ask. In order to study Radharani, Krsna lived in Her role and tried to
understand Himself. This is the secret of Lord Caitanya’s incarnation. Caitanya is
Krsna, but He has taken the mode or role of Radharani to show us how to love
Krsna. Thus He is addressed: ^“ offer my respectful obeisances unto the Supreme
Lord who is absorbed in Radharant’s thoughts.”

This brings up the question of who Radharani is and what Radha-Krsna is.
Actually Radha-Krsna is the exchange of love. This is not ordinary love; Krsna has
immense potencies, of which three are principal: internal, external and marginal.
In the internal potency there are three divisions: sarmvit, hladini and sandhini. The
hladinr potency is the pleasure potency. All living entities have this pleasure-seeking
potency, for all beings are trying to have pleasure. This is the very nature of the
living entity. At present we are trying to enjoy our pleasure potency by means of
the body in this material condition. By bodily contact we are attempting to derive


--- Page 12 ---

pleasure from material sense objects. We should not think, however, that Krsna, who
is always spiritual, tries to seek pleasure on this material plane like us. Krsna
describes the material universe as a nonpermanent place full of miseries. Why, then,
would He seek pleasure in the material form? He is the Supersoul, the supreme
spirit, and His pleasure is beyond the material conception.

In order to learn how Krsna’s pleasure can be obtained, we must read the Tenth
Canto of $rimad-Bhagavatam in which Krsna’s pleasure potency is displayed in His
pastimes with ২3017317301 and the damsels of Vraja. Unfortunately, unintelligent
people turn at once to the sports of Krsna in the Dasama-skandha, the Tenth
Canto. ।< {51725 embracing Radharani or His dancing with the cowherd girls in the
rasa dance are generally not understood by ordinary men because they consider
these pastimes in the light of mundane lust. They incorrectly think that Krsna is
like themselves and that He embraces the 0/5 just as an ordinary man embraces
a young girl. Some people thus become interested in Krsna because they think that
His religion allows indulgence in sex. This is not krspa-bhakti, love of Krsna, but
prakrta-sahajiya—materialistic lust.

In order to avoid such errors, we should understand what Radha-Krsna actually
is. Radha and Krsna display their pastimes through Krsna's internal energy. The
pleasure potency of Krsna's internal energy is a most difficult subject matter, and
unless one understands what Krsna is, he cannot understand it. Krsna does not take
any pleasure in this material world, but He has a pleasure potency. Because we are
part and parcel of Krsna, the pleasure potency is within us also, but we are trying
to exhibit that pleasure potency in matter. Krsna, however, does not make such a
vain attempt. The object of Krsna’s pleasure potency is Radharani, and He exhibits
His potency or His energy 25 Radharani and then engages in loving affairs with Her.
In other words, Krsna does not take pleasure in this external energy but exhibits
His internal energy, His pleasure potency, as Radharani. Thus Krsna manifests
Himself as Radharani in order to exhibit His internal pleasure potency. Of the many
extensions, expansions and incarnations of the Lord, this pleasure potency is the
foremost and chief.

It is not that Radharani is separate from Krsna. Radharani is also Krsna, for
there is no difference between the energy and the energetic. Without energy, there
is no meaning to the energetic, and without the energetic, there is no energy.
Similarly, without Radha there is no meaning to Krsna, and without Krsna, there
is no meaning to Radha. Because of this, the Vaisnava philosophy first of all pays
obeisances to and worships the internal pleasure potency of the Supreme Lord.
Thus the Lord and His potency are always referred to as Radha-Krsna. Similarly,
those who worship the name of Narayana first of all utter the name of Laksmf, as
Laksmi-Narayana. Similarly, those who worship Lord Rama first of all utter the
name of Sita. In any case—Sita-Rama, Radha-Krsna, Laksmi-Nardyana—the potency
always comes first.

Radha and Krsna are one, and when Krsna desires to enjoy pleasure, He manifests
Himself as Radharani. The spiritual exchange of love between Radha and Krsna is
the actual display of the internal pleasure potency of Krsna. Although we speak of


--- Page 13 ---
Introduction 9
“when” Krsna desires, just when He did desire we cannot say. We only speak in this
way because in conditional life we take it that everything has a beginning; however,
in the absolute or spiritual life there is neither beginning nor end. Yet in order to
understand that Radha and Krsna are one and that They also become divided, the
question “When?” automatically comes to mind. When Krsna desired to enjoy His
pleasure potency, He manifested Himself in the separate form of Radharani, and
when He wanted to understand Himself through the agency of Radha, He united
with Radharant, and that unification is called Lord Caitanya.

Why did Krsna assume the form of Caitanya Mahaprabhu? It is explained that
Krsna desired to know the glory of Radha’s love. “Why is She so much in love with
Me?” Krsna asked. “What is My special qualification that attracts Her so? And what
is the actual way in which She loves Me?” It seems strange that Krsna, as the
Supreme, should be attracted by anyone's love. We search after the love of a woman
or a man because we are imperfect and lack something. The love of a woman, that
potency and pleasure, is absent in man, and therefore a man wants a woman, but
thisisnot the case with Krsna, who is full in Himself. Thus Krsna expressed surprise:
“Why am | attracted by Radharani? And when Radharani feels My love, what is She
actually feeling?” In order to taste the essence of that loving affair, Krsna appeared
just as the moon appears on the horizon of the sea. Just as the moon was produced
by the churning of the sea, by the churning of spiritual love affairs the moon of
Caitanya Mahaprabhu appeared. Indeed, Caitanya’s complexion was golden, just
like the moon. Although this is figurative language, it conveys the meaning behind
the appearance of Caitanya Mahaprabhu. The full significance of His appearance will
be explained in later chapters.

The manifestations of the Supreme are also explained in Caitanya-caritamrta.
After offering respects to Lord Caitanya, Krsnadasa Kaviraja next offers them to
Nityananda. He explains that Nityananda is a manifestation of Sankarsana, who is
the origin of the Maha-Visnu. Krsna’s first manifestation is as Balarama and then
Sankarsana, and after Sarikarsana He is manifest as Pradyumna. In this way so many
expansions take place. Although there are many expansions, Lord Sri ।< {57215 the ori-
gin, as confirmed in Brahma-sarhhita. He is like the original candle from which many
thousands and millions of candles are lit. Although any number of candles can be
lighted, the original candle still retains its identity as the origin. In this way Krsna
expands, Himself into so many lights, and all these expansions are called visnu-tattva.
Visnu is a large light, and we are small lights, but all are expansions of Krsna.

When it is necessary to create the material universe, Visnu expands Himself as the
Maha-Vispu. This Maha-Vispu lies down on the Causal Ocean and breathes all the
universes from His nostrils. Thus from the Maha-Vispu and the Causal Ocean all the
universesspring, and all these universes float in the Causal Ocean. In this regard there
is the story of Vamana, who, when He took three steps, stuck His foot through the
covering of the universe. Water from the Causal Ocean flowed through the hole
which His foot made, and it is said that that flow of water became the River Ganges.
Therefore the Ganges is accepted as the most sacred water of Visnu and is worshiped
by all Hindus from the Himalayas down to the Bay of Bengal.


--- Page 14 ---
10

That Maha-Visnu who lies on the Causal Ocean is actually an expansion of
Balarama, who is Krsna's first expansion, and, in the Vyndavana pastimes, is the
brother of Krsna. In the maha-mantra Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare
Hare/ Hare Rima, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, the word Rama refers to
Balarama. Since Nityananda is an expansion. of Balarama, Rama also refers to Lord
Nityananda. Thus Hare Krsna, Hare Rama addresses not only Krsna and Balarama
but Lord Caitanya and Nityananda as well.

The subject matter of Caitanya-caritamyta primarily deals with what is beyond
this material creation. The cosmic material expansion is called maya because it has
no eternal existence. Because it is sometimes manifested and sometimes not
manifested, it is regarded as illusory. But beyond this temporary manifestation
there is a higher nature, as indicated in Bhagavad-gita:

paras tasmat tu bhavo ‘nyo
'vyakto 'vyaktat sanatanah
yah sa sarvesu bhiitesu
nasyatsu na vinaSyati
“Yet there is another nature, which is eternal and is transcendental to this manifested
and unmanifested matter. It is supreme and is never annihilated. When all in this
world is annihilated, that part remains as it is.” (Bg. 8.20)

That supreme nature is beyond the manifested (vyaktah) and unmanifested
(avyaktah). This superior nature which is beyond both creation and annihilation is
the living force which is manifest in the bodies of all living entities. The body itself
is composed of inferior nature, matter, but it is the superior nature that is moving
the body. The symptom of that superior nature is consciousness. Thus in the
spiritual world, where everything is composed of the superior nature, everything is
conscious. In the material world inanimate objects are not conscious, but in the
spiritual world this is not so. There a table is conscious, the land is conscious, the
trees are conscious—everything is conscious.

It is not possible to imagine how far this material manifestation extends. In the
material world everything is calculated by imagination or by some imperfect
method, but Vedic literatures give information of what lies beyond the material
universe. Those who believe in experimental knowledge may doubt the Vedic con-
clusions, for they cannot even calculate how far this universe is extended, nor can
they reach far into the universe itself. It is not possible to obtain information of
anything beyond this material nature by experimental means. That which is beyond
our power of conception is called acintya, inconceivable. It is useless to argue or
speculate about what is inconceivable. If it is truly inconceivable, it is not subject to
speculation or experimentation. Our energy is limited, and our sense perception is
limited; therefore we must rely on the Vedic conclusions regarding that subject
matter which is inconceivable. Knowledge of the superior nature must simply be
accepted without argument. How is it possible to argue about something to which
we have no access? The method for understanding transcendental subject matter is


--- Page 15 ---
Introduction 11
given by Lord Krsna Himself in Bhagavad-gita, where Krsna tells Arjuna at the be-
ginning of the Fourth Chapter:

imam vivasvate yogam
proktavan aham avyayam
vivasvan manave praha
manur iksvakave 'bravit
“linstructed this imperishable science of yoga to the sun-god, Vivasvan, and Vivasvan
instructed it to Manu, the father of mankind, and Manu in turn instructed it to
Iksvaku.” (Bg. 4.1)

This is the method of parampara, or disciplic succession. Similarly, in Srimad-
Bhagavatam Krsna imparted knowledge into the heart of Brahma, the first created
creature within the universe. Brahma imparted those lessons to his disciple, Narada,
and Naradaimparted that knowledge to his disciple, Vyasadeva. Vyasadeva imparted
it to Madhvacarya, and from Madhvacarya the knowledge comes down to
Madhavendra Puri, to Tsvara Puri and from him to Caitanya Mahaprabhu.

One may ask that if Caitanya Mahaprabhu is Krsna Himself, then why did He
need a spiritual master? Of course He did not need a spiritual master, but because
He was playing the role of acarya (one who teaches by example), He accepted a
spiritual master. Even Krsna Himself accepted a spiritual master, for that is the
system. In this way the Lord sets the example for men. We should not think, how-
ever, that the Lord takes a spiritual master because He is in want of knowledge. He
is simply stressing the importance of accepting the disciplic succession. The knowl-
edge of that disciplic succession actually comes from the Lord Himself, and if the
knowledge descends unbroken, it is perfect. Although we may not be in touch with
the original personality who first imparted the knowledge, we may receive the same
knowledge through this process of transmission. In Srimad-Bhagavatam, it is stated
that Krsna, the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead, transmitted transcen-
dental knowledge into the heart of Brahma. This, then, is one way knowledge is
received—through the heart. Thus there are two processes by which one may receive
knowledge: One depends upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is situated
as the Supersoul within the heart of all living entities, and the other depends upon
the guru or spiritual master, who is an expansion of Krsna. Thus Krsna transmits
information both from within and from without. We simply have to receive it. If
knowledge isreceived in this way, it doesn’t matter whether itis inconceivable or not.

In S$rimad-Bhagavatam there is a great deal of information given about the
Vaikuntha planetary systems which are beyond the material universe. Similarly, a
great deal of inconceivable information is given in Caitanya-caritamrta. Any attempt
to arrive at this information through experimental knowledge is not possible. The
knowledge simply has to be accepted. According to the Vedic method, $abda, or
transcendental sound, is regarded as evidence. Sound is very important in Vedic
understanding, for, if it is pure, it is accepted as authoritative. Even in the material
world we accept a great deal of information which is sent thousands of miles by


--- Page 16 ---
12

telephone or radio. In this way we also accept sound as evidence in our daily lives.
Although we cannot see the informant, we accept his information as valid on the
basis of sound. Sound vibration then is very important in the transmission of
Vedic knowledge.

The Vedas inform us that beyond this cosmic manifestation there are extensive
planets and the spiritual sky. This material manifestation is regarded as only a small
portion of the total creation. The material manifestation includes not only this
universe but innumerable others as well, but all the material universes combined
comprise only one fraction of the total creation. The majority of the creation is
situated in the spiritual sky. In that sky innumerable planets float, and these are
called Vaikunthalokas. In every Vaikunthaloka Nardyana presides in the form of
His four-armed expansions: 53113195303, Pradyumna, Aniruddha and Vasudeva.

As stated before, the material universes are manifested by the Lord in the form
of Maha-Visnu. Just as a husband and wife combine to beget offspring, the Maha-
Visnu combines with His wife Maya, or material nature. This is also confirmed in
the Bhagavad-gita where Krsna states:

sarva-yonigu kaunteya
martayah sambhavanti yah
tasam brahma mahad yonir
aharh bija-pradah pita
“It should be understood that all species of life, O son of KuntT, are made possible
by birth in this material nature, and that | am the seed-giving father.” (Bg. 14.4)

Visnu impregnated Maya or material nature simply by glancing at her. This is the
spiritual method. Materially we are limited to impregnate by only one particular
part of our body, but the Supreme Lord, Krsna or Maha-Visnu, can impregnate any
part by any part. Simply by glancing the Lord can conceive countless living entities
in the womb of material nature. The Brahma-sarnhita also confirms that the spiritual
body of the Supreme Lord is so powerful that any part of that body can perform
the functions of any other part. We can only touch with our hands or skin, but
Krsna can touch just by glancing. We can only see with our eyes, we cannot touch
or smell with them. Krsna, however, can smell and also eat with His eyes. When
foodstuffs are offered to Krsna we don’t see Him eating, but He eats simply by
glancing at the food. We cannot imagine how things work in the spiritual world
where everything is spiritual. It is not that Krsna does not eat or that we imagine
that He eats; He actually eats, but His eating is different from ours. Our eating
process will be similar to His when we are completely on the spiritual platform.
On that platform every part of the body can act on behalf of any other part.

Visnu does not require anything in order to create. He does not require the
goddess Laksmi in order to give birth to Brahma, for Brahma is born from a lotus
flower which grows from the navel of Visnu. The goddess Laksmi sits at the feet of
Visnu and serves Him. In this material world sex is required to produce children,
but in the spiritual world one can produce as many children as he likes without


--- Page 17 ---
Introduction 13
having to take help from his wife. Because we have no experience with spiritual
energy, we think that Brahma’s birth from the navel of Visnu is simply a fictional
story. We are not aware that spiritual energy is so powerful that it can do anything
and everything. Material energy is dependent on certain laws, but spiritual energy is
fully independent.

Brahma is born from the navel of Garbhodakaéayi Visnu, who is but a partial
manifestation of the Maha-Visnu. Countless universes reside like seeds within the
skin pores of the Maha-Visnu, and when He exhales, they all are manifest. In the
material world we have no experience of such a thing, but we do experience a
perverted reflection in the phenomenon of perspiration. We cannot imagine,
however, the duration of one breath of the Maha-Visnu, for within one breath all of
the universes are created and annihilated. Lord Brahma only lives for the duration
of one breath, and according to our time scale 4,320,000,000 years constitute only
twelve hours of Brahma, and Brahma lives one hundred of his years. Yet the whole
life of Brahma is contained within one breath of the Maha-Visnu. Thus it is not
possible for us to imagine the breathing power of the Supreme Lord. That Maha-
Visnu is but a partial manifestation of Krsna.

Thus Krspadasa Kaviraja Gosvami discusses Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu as Sri
Krsna Himself, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and Lord Nityananda as
Balarama, the first expansion of Krsna. Advaitacarya, another principal disciple of
Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s, is accepted as an expansion of the Maha-Visnu. Thus
Advaitacarya is also the Lord, or, more precisely, an expansion of the Lord. The
word advaita means nondual, and his name is such because he is nondifferent from
the Supreme Lord. He is also called acarya, teacher, because he disseminated Krsna
consciousness. In this way he is just like Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Although Caitanya
is Sri Krsna Himself, He appears as a devotee to teach people in general how to love
Krsna. Similarly, Advaitacarya appeared just to distribute the knowledge of Krsna
consciousness. Thus he is also the Lord incarnated as a devotee. Krsna is manifested
in five different expansions, and He and all of His associates appear as devotees of
the Supreme Lord in the form of $ri Krsna Caitanya, Nityananda, Advaitacarya,
Gadadhara, Srivasa and others. In all cases, Caitanya Mahaprabhu is the source of
energy for all His devotees. Since this is the case, if we take shelter of Caitanya
Mahaprabhu for the successful execution of Krsna consciousness, we are sure to
make progress. One devotional song by Narottama dasa Thakura states: “My dear
Lord Caitanya, please have mercy upon me. There is no one who is as merciful as
You. My plea is most urgent because Your mission is to deliver fallen souls, and no
one is more fallen than |. | beg priority.”

The author of Caitanya-caritamyta, Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvamt, was an inhabitant
of Vrndavana and a great devotee. He had been living with his family in Katwa, a
small town in the district of Burdwan in Bengal. His family also worshiped Radha-
Krsna, and once when there was some misunderstanding amongst his family about
devotional service, Krsnadasa Kaviraja was advised by Nityananda Prabhu in a dream
to leave home and go to Vrndavana. Although he was very old, he started out that
very night and went to live in Vrndavana. While he was there, he met some of the


--- Page 18 ---
14

Gosvamis, principal disciples of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu. He was requested to
write Caitanya-caritamrta by the devotees of Vrndavana. Although he began this
work at a very old age, by the grace of Lord Caitanya he finished it. Today it
remains the most authoritative book on Caitanya’s philosophy and life.

When Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami was living in Vrndavana, there were not very
many temples. At that time Madana-mohana, Govindaji and Gopinatha were the
three principal temples. As a resident of Vrndavana, he offered his respects to the
Deities in these temples and requested God's favor: “My progress in spiritual life is
very slow, so I'm asking Your help.” In Caitanya-caritamrta, Krsnadasa first offers
his obeisances to Madana-mohana vigraha, the Deity who can help us progress in
Krsna consciousness. In the execution of Krsna consciousness, our first business is to
know Krsna and our relationship with Him. To know Krsna is to know one’s self,
and to know one’s self is to know one’s relationship with Krsna. Since this relation-
ship can be learned by worshiping Madana-mohana vigraha, Krsnadisa Kavirija
Gosvami first establishes his relationship with Him.

When this is established, Krsnadasa begins to worship the functional Deity,
Govinda. Govinda resides eternally in Vrndavana. In the spiritual world of Vrndavana
the buildings are made of touchstone, the cows are known as surabhi cows, givers
of abundant milk, and the trees are known as wish-fulfilling trees, for they yield
whatever one desires. In Vrndavana Krsna herds the surabhi cows, and He is
worshiped by hundreds and thousands of gop7s, cowherd girls, who are all goddesses
of fortune. When Krsna descends to the material world, this same Vrndavana
descends just as an entourage accompanies an important personage. Because when
Krsna comes, His land also comes, Vrndavana is not considered to exist in the
material world. Therefore devotees take shelter of the Vrndavana in India, for it is
considered to be a replica of the original Vrndavana. Although one may complain
that no kalpa-vrksa, wish-fulfilling trees, exist there, when the Gosvamis were there,
the kalpa-vrksa were present. It is not that one can simply go to such a tree and
make demands; one must first become a devotee. The Gosvamis would live under a
tree for one night only, and the trees would satisfy all their desires. For the common
man this may all seem very wonderful, but as one makes progress in devotional
service, all this can be realized.

Vrndavana is actually experienced as it is by persons who have stopped trying to
derive pleasure from material enjoyment. “When will my mind become cleansed of
all hankering for material enjoyment so | will be able to see Vrndavana?” one great
devotee asks. The more Krsna conscious we become and the more we advance, the
more everything is revealed as spiritual. Thus Krsnadasa Kavirdja Gosvamt considered
Vrndavana in India to be as good as the Vrndavana in the spiritual sky, and in
Caitanya-caritamrta he describes Radharani and Krsna as seated beneath a wish-
fulfilling tree in Vrndavana on a throne decorated with valuable jewels. There Krsna's
dear friends, the cowherd boys and the 40/72, serve Radha and Krsna by singing,
dancing, offering betel nuts and refreshments and decorating Their Lordships with
flowers. Even today in India people decorate thrones and recreate this scene
during the month of July. Generally at that time people go to Vrndavana to offer
their respects to the Deities there.


--- Page 19 ---
Introduction 15

Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami maintains that the Radha and Krsna Deities show us
how to serve Radha and Krsna. The Madana-mohana Deities simply establish that
“I am Your eternal servant.” With Govinda, however, there is actual acceptance of
service, and therefore He is called the functional Deity. The Gopinatha Deity is
Krsna as master and proprietor of the 407. He attracted all the 40/78, or cowherd
girls, by the sound of His flute, and when they came, He danced with them. These
activities are all described in the Tenth Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam. These gopis
were childhood friends of Krsna, and they were all married, for in India the girls
are married by the age of twelve. The boys, however, are not married before
eighteen, so Krsna, who was fifteen or sixteen at the time, was not married.
Nonetheless He called these girls from their homes and invited them to dance with
Him. That dance is called the rasa-/7/a dance, and it is the most elevated of all the
Vrndavana pastimes. Krsna is therefore called Gopinatha because He is the beloved
master of the 40775.

Krspadasa Kaviraja Gosvami petitions the blessings of Lord Gopinatha. “May
that Gopinatha, the master of the 40/75, Krsna, bless you. May you become blessed
by Gopinatha.” Just as Krsna attracted the gopTs by the sweet sound of His flute,
the author of Caitanya-caritamyta prays that He will also attract the reader’s mind
by His transcendental vibration.

Sri Caitanya 14317313860 is none other than the combined form of 910 Radha
and Krsna. He is the life of those devotees who strictly follow in the footsteps of
Srila Ripa Gosvami. Srila Rupa Gosvami and Srila Sanatana Gosvami are the two
principal followers of Srila Svarlipa [21100213 Gosvami, who acted as the most
confidential servitor of Lord Sri Krsna CaitanyaMahaprabhu, known as Visvambhara
in His early life. A direct disciple of Srila Ripa Gosvami was Srila Raghunitha dasa
Gosvami. The author of $ri Caitanya-caritamrta, Srila Kisnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami,
stands as the direct disciple of Srila २००३ Gosvami and Srila Raghunatha 0353
Gosvami. ॥ A

The direct disciple of Srila Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami was Srila Narottama dasa
Thakura, who accepted Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti as his servitor. Srila Visvanitha
Cakravarti Thakura accepted Srila Jagannatha dasa Babaji, who initiated Srila
Bhaktivinoda Thakura, who in turn initiated Srila Gaurakisora dasa 8383], the
spiritual master of Or Visnupada Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami Maharaja,
the divine master of our humble self.

Since we belong to this chain of disciplic succession from Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu,
this edition of $7 Caitanya-caritamrta will contain nothing newly manufactured by
our tiny brains, but only remnants of foodstuff originally eaten by the Lord Himself.
Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu does not belong to the mundane plane of the three
qualitative modes. He belongs to the transcendental plane beyond the reach of the
imperfect sense perception of a living being. Even the most erudite mundane
scholar cannot approach the transcendental plane unless he submits himself to
transcendental sound with a receptive mood, for in that mood only can one realize
the message of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. What will be described herein, therefore,
has nothing to do with the experimental thoughts created by the speculative habits
of inert minds. The subject matter of this book is not a mental concoction but a
factual spiritual experience that one can realize only by accepting the line of
disciplic succession described above. Any deviation from that line will bewilder the
reader's understanding of the mystery of 5/7 Caitanya-caritamrta, which is a tran-
scendental literature meant for the post-graduate study of one who has realized
all the Vedic literatures such 25 the Upanigsads and Vedanta and their natural com-
mentaries such as S$rimad-Bhagavatam and Bhagavad-gita.

This edition of ऽत Caitanya-caritamrta is presented for the study of sincere
scholars who are really seeking the Absolute Truth. It is not the arrogant scholarship
of a mental speculator but a sincere effort to serve the order of a superior authority
whose service is the life and soul of this humble effort. It does not deviate even

17

18 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta

slightly from the revealed scriptures, and therefore anyone who follows in the
disciplic line will be able to realize the essence of this book simply by the method
of aural reception.

The First Chapter of $7 Caitanya-caritamrta begins with fourteen Sanskrit verses
that describe the Absolute Truth. Then the next three Sanskrit verses describe the
principal Deities of Vrndavana, namely, Sri Radha-Madana-mohana, Sri Radha-
Govindadeva and Sri Radhi-Gopinathaji. The first of the fourteen verses is a
symbolic representation of the Supreme Truth, and the entire First Chapter is in
actuality devoted to this single verse, which describes Lord Caitanya in His six
different transcendental expansions.

The first manifestation described is the spiritual master, who appears in two
plenary parts called the initiating spiritual master and instructing spiritual master.
They are identical because both of them are phenomenal manifestations of the
Supreme Truth. Next described are the devotees, who are divided into two classes,
namely, the apprentices and the graduates. Next are the incarnations (avatdras) of
the Lord, who are explained to be nondifferent from the Lord. These incarnations
are considered in three divisions—incarnations of the potency of the Lord, incarna-
tions of His qualities, and incarnations of His authority. In this connection, Lord
Sri Krsna's direct manifestations and His manifestations for transcendental pastimes
are discussed. Next considered are the potencies of the Lord, of which three prin-
01031 manifestations are described: the consorts in the kingdom of God (Vaikuntha),
the queens of Dvarakadhama and, highest of all, the damsels of Vrajadhama.
Finally, there is the Supreme Lord Himself, who is the fountainhead of all these
manifestations.

Lord Sri Krsna and His plenary expansions are all in the category of the Lord
Himself, the energetic Absolute Truth, whereas His devotees, His eternal associates,
are His energies. The energy and energetic are fundamentally one, but since their
functions are differently exhibited, they are simultaneously different also. Thus the
Absolute Truth is manifested in diversity in one unit. This philosophical truth, which
is pursuant to the Vedanta-satras, is called acintya-bhedabheda-tattva, or the con-
ception of simultaneous oneness and difference. In the latter portion of this chapter,
the transcendental position of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and that of Srila Nityananda
Prabhu are described with reference to the above theistic facts.

These three Deities of Vndavana [Madana-mohana, Govinda and Gopinatha]
have absorbed the heart and soul of the Gaugiya Vaisnavas [followers of Lord
Caitanya]. | worship Their lotus feet, for They are the Lords of my heart.

PURPORT

The author of &/7 Caitanya-caritamyta offers his respectful obeisances unto the
three Deities of Vrndavana named Sri Radha-Madana-mohana, 5 Radha-
Govindadeva and Sri Radha-Gopinathaji. These three Deities are the life and soul of
the Bengali Vaisnavas, or Gaudiya Vaisnavas, who have a natural aptitude for re-
siding in Vrndavana. The Gaudiya Vaisnavas who follow strictly in the line of Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu worship the Divinity by chanting transcendental sounds
meant to develop a sense of one’s transcendental relationship with the Supreme
Lord, a reciprocation of mellows (rasas) of mutual affection, and, ultimately, the
achievement of the desired success in loving service. These three Deities are wor-
shiped in three different stages of one’s development. The followers of Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu scrupulously follow these principles of approach.

Gaudiya Vaisnavas perceive the ultimate objective in Vedic hymns composed of
eighteen transcendental letters that adore Krsna as Madana-mohana, Govinda and
Gopijana-vallabha. Madana-mohana is He who charms Cupid, the god of love,
Govinda is He who pleases the senses and the cows, and Gopijana-vallabha is the
transcendental lover of the 40275. Krsna Himself is called Madana-mohana, Govinda,
Gopijana-vallabha and countless other names as He plays in His different pastimes
with His devotees.

The three Deities—Madana-mohana, Govinda and Gopfjana-vallabha—have very
specific qualities. Worship of Madana-mohana is on the platform of reestablishing
our forgotten relationship with the Personality of Godhead. In the material world
we are presently in utter ignorance of our eternal relationship with the Supreme
Lord. Pangoh refers to one who cannot move independently by his own strength,
and manda-mateh is one who is less intelligent because he is too absorbed in material-
istic activities. It is best for such'persons not to aspire for success in fruitive activities
or mental speculation, but instead simply to surrender to the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. The perfection of life is simply to surrender to the Supreme. In the
beginning of our spiritual life we must therefore worship Madana-mohana so that
He may attract us and nullify our attachment for material sense gratification. This
relationship with Madana-mohana is necessary for neophyte devotees. When one
wishes to render service to the Lord with strong attachment, one then worships
Govinda on the platform of transcendental service. Govinda is the reservoir of all


--- Page 33 ---
30 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta

pleasures. When by the grace of Krsna and the devotees one reaches perfection in
devotional service, he can appreciate Krsna as Gopijana-vallabha, the pleasure Deity
of the damsels of Vraja.

Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu explained this mode of devotional service in three
stages, and therefore these worshipable Deities were installed in Vrndavana by dif-
ferent Gosvamis. They are very dear to the Gaudiya Vaisnavas there, who visit the
temples at least once a day. Besides the temples of these three Deities, many other
temples have been established in Vindavana, such as the temple of Radha-Damodara
of Jiva Gosvami, the temple of Syamasundara of Syamananda Gosvami, the temple
of Gokulananda of Lokanatha Gosvami, and the temple of Radharamana of Gopala
Bhatta Gosvami. There are seven principal temples over four hundred years old that
are the most important of the 5,000 temples now existing in Vrndavana.

“‘Gaudrya” indicates the part of India between the southern side of the Himalayan
Mountains and the northern part of the Vindhya Hills, which is called Aryavarta, or
the Land of the Aryans. This portion of India is divided into five parts or provinces
(Panca-gaudadesa): Sarasvata (Kashmir and Punjab), Kanyakubja (Uttar Pradesh,
including the modern city of Lucknow), Madhya-gauda (Madhya Pradesh), Maithila
(Bihar and part of Bengal) and Utkala (part of Bengal and the whole of Orissa).
Bengal is sometimes called Gaugdadesa, partly because it forms a portion of Maithila
and partly because the capital of the Hindu king Raja Laksmana Sena was known as
Gauga. This old capital later came to be known as Gaudapura and gradually Mayapur.

The devotees of Orissa are called Udiyas, the devotees of Bengal are called Gaudiyas,
and the devotees of southern India are known 25 Dravigi devotees. As there are five
provinces in Aryavarta, 50 Daksinatya, southern India, is also divided into five
provinces, which are called Pafica-dravida. The four Vaisnava dcdryas who are the
great authorities of the four Vaisnava disciplic successions, as well as Sripada
Sarikaracarya of the Mayavada school, appeared in the Parica-dravida provinces.
Among the four Vaisnava dcdryas, who are all accepted by the Gaudiya Vaisnavas,
Sri Ramanuja Acarya appeared in the southern part of Andhra Pradesh at Mahabhiita-
puri, Sri Madhva Acarya appeared at Pajakam (near Vimanagiri) in the district of `
Myargalora, Sri Visnusvami appeared at Pandya, and Sri Nimbarka appeared at
Murigera-patana in the extreme south.

Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu accepted the chain of disciplic succession from Madhva
Acarya, but the Vaisnavas in His line do not accept the tattva-vadis, who also claim
to belong to the Madhva-sampradaya. To distinguish themselves clearly from the
tattva-vadi branch of Madhva’s descendants, the Vaisnavas of Bengal prefer to call
themselves Gaudiya Vaisnavas. < Madhva Acirya is also known as Sri Gauda-
00131731703, and therefore the name Madhva-Gaudiya-sampradaya is quite suitable
for the disciplic succession of the Gaudiya Vaisnavas. Our spiritual master, Om
৬1510740303 Srimad Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami Maharaja, accepted initiation
in the Madhva-Gaudiya-sampradaya.

Lord Caitanya is the Absolute Truth, Krsna Himself. This is substantiated by
evidence from the authentic spiritual scriptures. Sometimes people accept a man as
God on the basis of their whimsical sentiments and without reference to the revealed
scriptures, but the author of Caitanya-caritamrta proves all his statements by citing
the sdstras. Thus he establishes that Caitanya Mahaprabhu is the Supreme Personality
of Godhead.

Lord, the Lord’s incarnations, His plenary portions, His energies, and the primeval
Lord Himself, Sri Krsna Caitanya.

PURPORT

Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami has composed this Sanskrit verse for the beginning
of his book, and now he will explain it in detail. He offers his respectful obeisances
to the six principles of the Absolute Truth. Guran is plural in number because any-
one who gives spiritual instructions based on the revealed scriptures is accepted as a
spiritual master. Although others give help in showing the way to beginners, the guru
who firstinitiates one with the maha-mantra is to be known as the initiator, and the
saints who give instructions for progressive advancement in Krsna consciousness are
called instructing spiritual masters. The initiating and instructing spiritual masters
are equal and identical manifestations of Krsna, although they have different dealings.
Their function is to guide the conditioned souls back home, back to Godhead. There-
fore Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami accepted Nityananda Prabhu and the six Gosvamis
in the category of guru. „

Isa-bhaktan refers to the devotees of the Lord like Sri Srivasa and all other such
followers, who are the energy of the Lord and are qualitatively nondifferent from
Him. Tsavatdarakan refers to acaryas like Advaita Prabhu, who is an avatdra of the
Lord. Tat-prakasan indicates the direct manifestation of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Nityananda Prabhu, and the initiating spiritual master. Tac-chaktih refers
to the spiritual energies (Sakis) of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Gadadhara, Damodara
and Jagadananda belong to this category of internal energy.

Thesix principles are differently manifested but allequally worshipable. Krsnadasa
Kaviraja begins by offering his obeisances unto them to teach us the method of
worshiping Lord Caitanya. The external potency of Godhead called mdya can never
associate with the Lord, just as darkness cannot remain in the presence of light; yet
darkness, being but an illusory and temporary covering of light, has no existence in-
dependent of light.

TRANSLATION

I first offer my respectful obeisances at the lotus feet of my initiating spiritual

master and all my instructing spiritual masters.
PURPORT

Srila Jiva Gosvami, in his thesis Bhakti-sandarbha (202), has stated that uncon-
taminated devotional service is the objective of pure Vaisnavas and that one has to
execute such service in the association of other devotees. By associating with devotees
of Lord Krsna, one develops a sense of Krsna consciousness and thus becomes in-
clined toward the loving service of the Lord. This is the process of approaching the
Supreme Lord by gradual appreciation in devotional service. If one desires unalloyed
devotional service, one must associate with devotees of Sri Krsna, for by such asso-
ciation only can a conditioned soul achieve a taste for transcendental love and thus
revive his eternal relation with Godhead in a specific manifestation and in terms of
the specific transcendental mellow (rasa) that one has eternally inherent in him.

If one develops love for Krsna by Krspa conscious activities, one can know the
Supreme Absolute Truth, but he who tries to understand God simply by logical
arguments will not succeed, nor will he get a taste for unalloyed devotion. The
secret is that one must submissively listen to those who know perfectly the science
of God, and one must begin the mode of service regulated by the preceptor. A
devotee already attracted by the name, form, qualities, etc., of the Supreme Lord
may be directed to his specific manner of devotional service; he need not waste time
in approaching the Lord through logic. The expert spiritual master knows well how
to engage his disciple’s energy in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, and
thus he engages a devotee in a specific devotional service according to his special
tendency. A devotee must have only one initiating spiritual master because in the
scriptures acceptance of more than one is always forbidden. There is no limit, how-
ever, to the number of instructing spiritual masters one may accept. Generally a
spiritual master who constantly instructs a disciple in spiritual science becomes his
initiating spiritual master later on.

One should always remember that a person who is reluctant to accept a spiritual
master and be initiated is sure to be baffled in his endeavor to go back to Godhead.
One who is not properly initiated may present himself as a great devotee, but in fact
he is sure to encounter many stumbling blocks on his path of progress toward spiri-
tual realization, with the result that he must continue his term of material existence
without relief. Such a helpless person is compared to a ship without a rudder, for
such a ship can never reach its destination. It is imperative, therefore, that one accept
a spiritual master if he at all desires to gain the favor of the Lord. The service of the
spiritual master is essential. If there is no chance to serve the spiritual master directly,
a devotee should serve him by remembering his instructions. There is no difference
between the spiritual. master’s instructions and the spiritual master himself. In his
absence, therefore, his words of direction should be the pride of the disciple. If one
thinks that he is above consulting anyone else, including a spiritual master, he is at
once an offender at the lotus feet of the Lord. Such an offender can never go back
to Godhead. It is imperative that a serious person accept a bona fide spiritual master


--- Page 42 ---
Adi-Iila, Chapter 1 39
in terms of the sastric injunctions. Sri Jiva Gosvami advises that one not accept a
spiritual master in terms of hereditary or customary social and ecclesiastical con-
ventions. One should simply try to find a genuinely qualified spiritual master for
actual advancement in spiritual understanding.

manifestation of the Lord. With this conviction, a disciple can advance in Krsna con-
sciousness. The spiritual master is nondifferent from Krsna because he is a mani-
festation of Krsna.

Lord Nityananda, who is Balarama Himself, the first direct manifestation or
expansion of Krsna, is the original spiritual master. He helps Lord Krsna in His
pastimes, and He is a servant of the Lord.

Every living entity is eternally a servant of Sri Krsna Caitanya; therefore the
spiritual master cannot be other than a servant of Lord Caitanya. The spiritual
master’s eternal occupation is to expand the service of the Lord by training disciples
in a service attitude. A spiritual master never poses as the Supreme Lord Himself;
he is considered a representative of the Lord. The revealed scriptures prohibit one’s
pretending to be God, but a bona fide spiritual master is a most faithful and con-
fidential servant of the Lord and therefore deserves as much respect as Krsna.

with the Supreme Lord. A spiritual master always represents himself as the humblest
servitor of the Personality of Godhead, but the disciple must look upon him as the

“One should know the acarya as Myself and never disrespect him in any way. One
should not envy him, thinking him an ordinary man, for he is the representative of
all the demigods.”

PURPORT

This is a verse from Srimad-Bhdgavatam (11.17.27) spoken by Lord Krsna when
He was questioned by Uddhava regarding the four social and spiritual orders of
society. He was specifically instructing how a brahmacari should behave under the
care of a spiritual master. A spiritual master is not an enjoyer of facilities offered
by his disciples. He is like a parent. Without the attentive service of his parents,
a child cannot grow to manhood; similarly, without the care of the spiritual master
one cannot rise to the plane of transcendental service.

The spiritual master is also called dcarya, or a transcendental professor of spiritual
science. The Manu-sarnhitd (2.140) explains the duties of an dcdrya, describing that
a bona fide spiritual master accepts charge of disciples, teaches them the Vedic
knowledge with all its intricacies, and gives them their second birth. The ceremony
performed to initiate a disciple into the study of spiritual science is called upaniti,
or the function that brings one nearer to the spiritual master. One who cannot be
brought nearer to a spiritual master cannot have a sacred thread, and thus he is
indicated to be a s@dra. The sacred thread on the body of 2 brahmana, ksatriya or
vaisya is a symbol of initiation by the spiritual master; it is worth nothing if worn
merely to boast of high parentage. The duty of the spiritual master is to initiate a
disciple with the sacred thread ceremony, and after this sarhskdra, or purificatory
process, the spiritual master actually begins to teach the disciple about the Vedas.
A person born a sadra is not barred from such spiritual initiation, provided he is
approved by the spiritual master, who is duly authorized to award a disciple the
right to be a brahmapa if he finds him perfectly qualified. In the Vayu Purapa an
dcdrya is defined as one who knows the import of all Vedic literature, explains the
purpose of the Vedas, abides by their rules and regulations, and teaches his disciples
to act in the same way.

Only out of His immense compassion does the Personality of Godhead reveal
Himself as the spiritual master. Therefore in the dealings of an dcdrya there are no
activities but those of transcendental loving service to the Lord. He is the Supreme
Personality of Servitor Godhead. It is worthwhile to take shelter of such a steady


--- Page 48 ---
Adi-Ia, Chapter 1 45
devotee, who is called dsraya-vigraha, or the manifestation or form of the Lord of
whom one must take shelter.

If one poses himself as andcdrya but does not have an attitude of servitorship:to
the Lord, he must be considered an offender, and this offensive attitude disqualifies
him from being an dcdrya. The bona fide spiritual master always engages in unalloyed
devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. By this test he is known
to be a direct manifestation of the Lord and a genuine representative of $riNityananda-
Prabhu. Such a spiritual master is known as dcaryadeva. Influenced by an envious
temperament and dissatisfied because of an attitude of sense gratification, mundaners
criticize a real dcdrya. In fact, however, a bona fide dcarya is nondifferent from the
Personality of Godhead, and therefore to envy such an dcdrya is to envy the Person-
ality of Godhead Himself. This will produce an effect subversive to transcendental
realization.

As mentioned previously, a disciple should always respect the spiritual master as
amanifestation of Sri Krsna, but at the same time one should always remember that
a spiritual master is never authorized to imitate the transcendental pastimes of the
Lord. False spiritual masters pose themselves as identical with Sri Krsna in every
respect to exploit the sentiments of their disciples, but such impersonalists can only
mislead their disciples, for their ultimate aim is to become one with the Lord. This
is against the principles of the devotional cult.

The real Vedic philosophy is acintya-bhedabheda-tattva, which establishes every-
thing to be simultaneously one with and different from the Personality of Godhead.
Srila Raghunatha dasa Gosvami confirms that this is the real position of a bona fide
spiritual master and says that one should always think of the spiritual master in
terms of his intimate relationship with Mukunda (तं Krsna). Srila Jiva Gosvami, in
his Bhakti-sandarbha (213), has clearly defined that a pure ५९५०1९९5 observation of
the spiritual master and Lord Siva as one with the Personality of Godhead exists in
terms of their being very dear to the Lord, not identical with Him in all respects.
Following in the footsteps of Srila Raghunatha dasa Gosvami and Srila Jiva Gosvami,
later dcaryas like Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura have confirmed the same
truths. In his prayers to the spiritual master, Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura
confirms that all the revealed scriptures accept the spiritual master to be identical
with the Personality of Godhead because he is a very dear and confidential servant
of the Lord. Gaugdiya Vaisnavas therefore worship Srila Gurudeva (the spiritual
master) in the light of his being the servitor of the Personality of Godhead. In all
the ancient literatures of devotional service and in the more recent songs of Srila
Narottama dasa Thakura, Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura and other unalloyed Vaignavas,
the spiritual master is always considered either one of the confidential associates of
Srimati Radharani or a manifested representation of Srila Nitydnanda Prabhu.

TRANSLATION

One should know the instructing spiritual master to be the Personality of Krspa.
Lord Krsna manifests Himself as the Supersoul and as the greatest devotee of the
Lord.

PURPORT

Srila Krspadasa Kaviraja Gosvami states that the instructing spiritual master is a
bona fide representative of $ri Krsna. Sri Krsna Himself teaches us as the instructing
spiritual master from within and without. From within He teaches as Paramatma,
our constant companion, and from without He teaches from Bhagawad-gita as the
instructing spiritual master. There are two kinds of instructing spiritual masters.
One is the liberated person fully absorbed in meditation in devotional service, and
the other is he who invokes the disciple’ spiritual consciousness by means of relevant
instructions. Thus the instructions in the science of devotion are differentiated in
terms of the objective and subjective ways of understanding. The dcdrya in the true
sense of the term, who is authorized to deliver Krsna, enriches the disciple with full
spiritual knowledge and thus awakens him to the activities of devotional service.

When by learning from the self-realized spiritual master one actually engages
himself in the service of Lord Visnu, functional devotional service begins. The
procedures of this devotional service are known as abhidheya, or action one is duty-
bound to perform. Our only shelter is the Supreme Lord, and one who teaches
how to approach Krsna is the functioning form of the Personality of Godhead. There
is no difference between the shelter-giving Supreme Lord and the initiating and
instructing spiritual masters. If one foolishly discriminates between them, he commits
an offense in the discharge of devotional service.

Srila Sanatana Gosvamii is the ideal spiritual master, for he delivers one the shelter
of the lotus feet of Madana-mohana. Even though one may be unable to travel on
the field of Vrndavana due to forgetfulness of his relationship with the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, he can get an adequate opportunity to stay in Vrndavana
and derive all spiritual benefits by the mercy of Sanatana Gosvami. तं Govindaji
acts exactly like the $iksdguru (instructing spiritual master) by teaching Arjuna
Bhagavad-gita. He is the original preceptor, for He gives us instructions and an
opportunity to serve Him. The initiating spiritual master is a personal manifestation
of Srila Madana-mohana vigraha, whereas the instructing spiritual master is a personal
representative of Srila Govindadeva vigraha. Both of these Deities are worshiped at
Vrndavana. Srila Gopinatha is the ultimate attraction in spiritual realization.

PURPORT
This verse of Bhagavad-gita (10.10) clearly states how Govindadeva instructs His
bona fide devotee. The Lord declares that by enlightenment in theistic knowledge
He awards attachment for Him to those who constantly engage in His transcendental
loving service. This awakening of divine consciousness enthralls a devotee, who
thus relishes his eternal transcendental mellow. Such an awakening is awarded only
to those convinced by devotional service about the transcendental nature of the
Personality of Godhead. They know that the Supreme Truth, the all-spiritual and
all-powerful person, is one without a second and has fully transcendental senses.
He is the fountainhead of all emanations. Such pure devotees, always merged in
knowledge of Krsna and absorbed in Krsna consciousness, exchange thoughts and
realizations as great scientists exchange their views and discuss the results of their
research in scientific academies. Such exchanges of thoughts in regard to Krsna give
pleasure to the Lord, who therefore favors such devotees with all enlightenment.

Personality of Godhead’s acting as the spiritual master from within. He was
the spiritual master who instructed Brahma, the original living being in the
cosmic creation. When Brahma was first created, he could not apply his creative
energy to arrange the cosmic situation. At first there was only sound,
vibrating the word tapa, which indicates the acceptance of hardships for
spiritual realization. Refraining from sensual enjoyment, one should voluntarily
acceptall sorts of difficulty for spiritual realization. This is called tapasya. An enjoyer
of the senses can never realize God, godliness or the science of theistic knowledge.
Thus when Brahma, initiated by Sri Krsna by the sound vibration tapa, engaged
himself in acts of austerity, by the pleasure of Visnu he was able to visualize the
transcendental world, Sri Vaikuntha, through transcendental realization. Modern
science can communicate using material discoveries such as radio, television and
computers, but the science invoked by the austerities of Sri Brahma, the original
father of mankind, was still more subtle. In time, material scientists may also know
how we can communicate with the Vaikuntha world. Lord Brahma inquired about
the potency of the Supreme Lord, and the Personality of Godhead answered his
inquiry in the following six consecutive statements. These instructions, which are
reproduced in the Srimad-Bhagavatam (2.9.31-36), were imparted by the Personality
of Godhead, acting as the supreme spiritual master.

everything else related to Him. There is nothing in existence not related with Sit
Krsna. In a sense, there is nothing but $iT Krsna, and yet nothing is $ri Krsna save
and except His primeval personality. This knowledge constitutes a complete tran-
scendental science, and Visnu wanted to give 8121117 [† full knowledge about that
science. The mystery of this knowledge culminates in personal attachment to the
Lord, with a resulting effect of detachment from anything “non-Krsna.”” There are
nine alternative transcendental means to attain this stage: hearing, chanting, remem-
bering, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, worshiping, praying, assisting, fraternizing
with the Lord, and sacrificing everything for Him. These are different parts of the
same devotional service, which is full of transcendental mystery. The Lord said to
Brahma that since He was pleased with him, by His grace the mystery was being
revealed.

The transcendental personal forms of the Lord are a mystery, and the symptoms
of these forms, which are absolutely different from anything made of mundane
elements, are also mysterious. The innumerable forms of the Lord, such as
Syamasundara, Narayana, Rima and Gaurasundara; the colors of these forms (white,
red, yellow, cloudlike syama and others); His qualities, as the responsive Personality
of Godhead to pure devotees and as impersonal Brahman to dry speculators; His
uncommon activities like lifting Govardhana Hill, marrying more than 16,000
queens at Dvaraka, and entering the rasa dance with the damsels of Vraja, expanding
Himself in as many forms as there were damsels in the dance—these and innumerable
other uncommon acts and attributes are all mysteries, one aspect of which is pre-

sented in the scientific knowledge of Bhagavad-gita, which is read and adored all
over the world by all classes of scholars, with as many interpretations as there are
empiric philosophers. The truth of these mysteries was revealed to Brahma by a
descending process, without the help of the ascending one. His mercy descends
to a devotee like Brahma and, through Brahma, to Narada, from Narada to Vyasa,
from Vyasadeva to Sukadeva and so on in the bona fide chain of disciplic succession.
We cannot discover the mysteries of the Lord by our mundane endeavors; they are
only revealed, by His grace, to the proper devotees. These mysteries are gradually
disclosed to the various grades of devotees in proportion to the gradual development
of their service attitude. In other words, impersonalists who depend upon the
strength of their poor fund of knowledge and morbid speculative habits, without
submission and service in the forms of hearing, chanting and the others mentioned
above, cannot penetrate to the mysterious region of transcendence where the
supremetruth is atranscendental person, free from all tinges of the material elements.
Discovering the mystery of the Lord eliminates the impersonal feature realized by
common spiritualists who are merely trying to enter the spiritual region from the
mundane platform.

TRANSLATION

“Prior to the cosmic creation, only | exist, and no phenomena exist, either

PURPORT

Aham means “1”; therefore the speaker who is saying aham, “1,” must have His
own personality. The MayavadT philosophers interpret this word aham as referring
to the impersonal Brahman. These Mayavadis are very proud of their grammatical
knowledge, but any person who has actual knowledge of grammar can understand


--- Page 55 ---
52 Sri Caitanya-caritimrta

that aham means “|” and that “I” refers to a personality. Therefore, the Personality
of Godhead, speaking to Brahma, uses aham while describing His own transcendental
form. Aham has a specific meaning; it is not a vague term that can be whimsically
interpreted. Aham, when spoken by Krsna, refers to the Supreme Personality of
Godhead and nothing else.

Before the creation and after its dissolution, only the Supreme Personality of
Godhead and His associates exist; there is no existence of the material elements.
This is confirmed in the Vedic literature. Vasudevo va idam agra asin na brahma na
ca sahkarah. The meaning of this mantra is that before creation there was no exist-
ence of Brahma or Siva, for only Visnu existed. Visnu exists in His abode, the
Vaikunthas. There are innumerable Vaikuntha planets in the spiritual sky, and on
each of them Visnu resides with His associates and His paraphernalia. It is also con-
firmed in Bhagavad-gita that although the creation is periodically dissolved, there
is another abode, which is never dissolved. The word ‘‘creation” refers to the material
creation because in the spiritual world everything exists eternally and there is no
creation or dissolution.

The Lord indicates herein that before the material creation He existed in fullness
with all transcendental opulences, including all strength, all wealth, all beauty, all
knowledge, all fame and all renunciation. If one thinks of a king, he automatically
thinks of his secretaries, ministers, military commanders, palaces and so on. Since a
king has such opulences, one can simply try to imagine the opulence of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. When the Lord says aham, therefore, it is to be understood
that He exists with full potency, including all opulences.

The word yat refers to Brahman, the impersonal effulgence of the Lord. In the
Brahma-sarhhita (5.40) it is said, tad-brahma niskalam anantam asesa-bhiatam: the
Brahman effulgence expands unlimitedly. Just as the sun is a localized planet
although the sunshine expands unlimitedly from that source, so the Absolute Truth
is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but His effulgence of energy, Brahman,
expands unlimitedly. From that Brahman energy the creation appears, just as a
cloud appears in sunshine. From the cloud comes rain, from the rain comes vegetation,
and from the vegetation come fruits and flowers, which are the basis of subsistence for
many other forms of life. Similarly, the effulgent bodily luster of the Supreme Lord
is the cause of the creation of infinite universes. The Brahman effulgence is im-
personal, but the cause of that energy is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
From Him, in His abode, the Vaikunthas, this brahmajyoti emanates. He is never
impersonal. Since they cannot understand the source of the Brahman energy,
impersonalists mistakenly choose to think this impersonal Brahman the ultimate
or absolute goal. But as stated in the Upanisads, one has to penetrate the impersonal
effulgence to see the face of the Supreme Lord. If one desires to reach the source
of the sunshine, he has to travel through the sunshine to reach the sun and then
meet the predominating deity there. The Absolute Truth is the Supreme Person,
Bhagavan, as the S$rimad-Bhagavatam explains.

Sat means “effect,” 05৫1 means ‘‘cause,” and param refers to the ultimate
truth, which is transcendental to cause and effect. The cause of the
creation is called the mahat-tattva, or total material energy, and its effect


--- Page 56 ---
Adi-Iia, Chapter 1 53
is the creation itself. But neither cause nor effect existed in the beginning;
they emanated from {116 Supreme Personality of Godhead, as did the energy of
time. This is stated in the Vedanta-satra (janmddy asya yatah). The source of birth
of the cosmic manifestation or mahat-tattva is the Personality of Godhead. This is
confirmed throughout the $rimad-Bhagavatam and Bhagavad-gita. \n Bhagavad-gita
(10.8) the Lord says, ahari sarvasya prabhavah: “| am the fountainhead of all
emanations.” The material cosmos, being temporary, is sometimes manifest and
sometimes unmanifest, but its energy emanates from the Supreme Absolute Lord.
Before the creation there was neither cause nor effect, but the Supreme Personality
of Godhead existed with His full opulence and energy.

The words pascad aham indicate that the Lord exists after the dissolution of
the cosmic manifestation. When the material world is dissolved, the Lord still exists
personally in the Vaikunthas. During the creation the Lord also exists as He is in
the Vaikunthas, and He also exists as the Supersoul within the material universes.
This is confirmed in the Brahma-sarhhita (5.37). Goloka eva nivasati: although He is
perfectly and eternally present in Goloka Vrndavana in Vaikuntha, He is neverthe-
less all-pervading (akhilatma-bhiitah). The all-pervading feature of the Lord is called
the Supersoul. In Bhagavad-gTta it is said, aharh krtsnasya jagatah prabhavah: the cos:
mic manifestation is a display of the energy of the Supreme Lord. The material
elements (earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego) display the
inferior energy of the Lord, and the living entities are His superior energy. Since the
energy of the Lord is not different from Him, in fact everything that exists is Krsna
in His impersonal feature. Sunshine, sunlight and heat are not different from the
sun, and yet simultaneously they are distinct energies of the sun. Similarly, the cos-
mic manifestation and the living entities are energies of the Lord, and they are con-
sidered to be simultaneously one with and different from Him. The Lord therefore
says, ^| am everything,” because everything is His energy and is therefore non-
different from Him.

Yo "vasisyeta so 'smy aham indicates that the Lord is the balance that exists after
the dissolution of the creation. The spiritual manifestation never vanishes. It belongs
to the internal energy of the Supreme Lord and exists eternally. When the external
manifestation is withdrawn, the spiritual activities in Goloka and the rest of the
Vaikunthas continue, unrestricted by material time, which has no existence in the
spiritual world. Therefore in Bhagavad-gita it is said, yad gatva na nivartante tad
dhama paramarn mama: “The abode from which no one returns to this material
world is the supreme abode of the Lord.” (Bg. 15.6)

TRANSLATION

“What appears to be truth without Me is certainly My illusory energy, for nothing
can exist without Me. It is like a reflection of a real light in the shadows, for in the
light there are neither shadows nor reflections.

PURPORT

In the previous verse the Absolute Truth and its nature have been explained. One
must also understand the relative truth to actually know the Absolute. The relative
truth, which is called maya, or material nature, is explained here. Maya has no
independent existence. One who is less intelligent is captivated by the wonderful
activities of maya, but he does not understand that behind these activities is the
direction of the Supreme Lord. In Bhagavad-gita it is said, mayadhyaksena prakrtih
sayate sa-caracaram: the material nature is working and producing moving and
nonmoving beings only by the supervision of Krsna (Bg. 9.10).

The real nature of maya, the illusory existence of the material manifestation, is
clearly explained in Srimad-Bhagavatam. The Absolute Truth is substance, and the
relative truth depends upon its relationship with the Absolute for its existence.
Maya means energy; therefore the relative truth is explained to be the energy of the
Absolute Truth. Since it is difficult to understand the distinction between the
absolute and relative truths, an example can be given for clarification. The Absolute
Truth can be compared to the sun, which is appreciated in terms of two relative
truths: reflection and darkness. Darkness is the absence of sunshine, and a reflection
is a projection of sunlight into darkness. Neither darkness nor reflection has an
independent existence. Darkness comes when the sunshine is blocked. For example,
if one stands facing the sun, his back will be in darkness. Since darkness stands in
the absence of the sun, it is therefore relative to the sun. The spiritual world is com-
pared to the real sunshine, and the material world is compared to the dark regions
where the sun is not visible.

When the material manifestation appears very wonderful, this is due to a perverted
reflection of the supreme sunshine, the Absolute Truth, as confirmed in the Vedanta-
58170. Whatever one can see here has its substance in the Absolute. As darkness is
situated far away from the sun, so the material world is also far away from the
spiritual world. The Vedic literature directs us not to be captivated by the dark
regions (tamah) but to try to reach the shining regions of the Absolute (yogi-dhdma).


--- Page 58 ---
Adi-Iila, Chapter 1 55
The spiritual world is brightly illuminated, but the material world is wrapped in
darkness. In the material world, sunshine, moonshine or different kinds of artificial
light are required to dispel darkness, especially at night, for by nature the material
world is dark. Therefore the Supreme Lord has arranged for sunshine and moonshine.
But in His abode, as described in Bhagavad-gita (15.6), there is no necessity for
lighting by sunshine, moonshine or electricity because everything is self-effulgent.
That which is relative, temporary and far away from the Absolute Truth is called
mdya, or ignorance. This illusion is exhibited in two ways, as explained in Bhagavad-
gita. The inferior illusion is inert matter, and the superior illusion is the living entity.
The living entities are called illusory in this context only because they are implicated
in the illusory structures and activities of the material world. Actually the living
entities are not illusory, for they are parts of the superior energy of the Supreme
Lord and do not have to be covered by mdya if they do not want to be so. The
actions of the living entities in the spiritual kingdom are not illusory; they are the
actual, eternal activities of liberated souls.

TRANSLATION
“As the material elements enter the bodies of all living beings and yet remain
outside them all, | exist within all material creations and yet am not within them.
PURPORT
The gross material elements (earth, water, fire, air and ether) combine with the
subtle material elements (mind, intelligence and false ego) to construct the bodies
of this material world, and yet they are beyond these bodies as well. Any material
construction is nothing but an amalgamation or combination of material elements in
varied proportions. These elements exist both within and beyond the body. For
example, although the sky exists in space, it also enters within the body. Similarly,


--- Page 59 ---
56 $ri Caitanya-caritamrta
the Supreme Lord, who is the cause of the material energy, lives within the material
world as well as beyond it. Without His presence within the material world, the
cosmic body could not develop, just as without the presence of the spirit within the
physical body, the body could not develop. The entire material manifestation
develops and exists because the Supreme Personality of Godhead enters it as
Paramatma, or the Supersoul. The Personality of Godhead in His all-pervading
feature of Paramatma enters every entity, from the biggest to the most minute.
His existence can be realized by one who has the single qualification of submissive-
ness and who thereby becomes a surrendered soul. The development of submissive-
ness is the cause of proportionate spiritual realization, by which one can ultimately
meet the Supreme Lord in person, as a man meets another man face to face.

Because of his development of transcendental attachment for the Supreme Lord,
a surrendered soul feels the presence of his beloved everywhere, and all his senses
are engaged in the loving service of the Lord. His eyes are engaged in seeing the
beautiful couple $ri Radha and Krsna sitting on a decorated throne beneath a desire
tree in the transcendental land of Vrndavana. His nose is engaged in smelling the
spiritual aroma of the lotus feet of the Lord. Similarly, his ears are engaged in
hearing messages from Vaikuntha, and his hands embrace the lotus feet of the
Lord and His associates. Thus the Lord is manifested to a pure devotee from within
and without. This is one of the mysteries of the devotional relationship in which
a devotee and the Lord are bound by a tie of spontaneous love. To achieve this love
should be the goal of life for every living being.

Adi-lila, Chapter 1 57
PURPORT

Those who are serious about the knowledge of the transcendental world, which
is far beyond the material cosmic creation, must approach a bona fide spiritual
master to learn the science both directly and indirectly. One must learn both the
means to approach the desired destination and the hindrances to such progress. The
spiritual master knows how to regulate the habits of a neophyte disciple, and there-
fore a serious student must learn the science in all its aspects from him.

There are different grades and standards of prosperity. The standard of comfort
and happiness conceived by a common man engaged in material labor is the lowest
grade of happiness, for it is in relationship with the body. The highest standard of
such bodily comfort is achieved by a fruitive worker who by pious activities reaches
the plane of heaven, or the kingdom of the creative gods with their delegated powers.
But the conception of comfortable life in heaven is insignificant in comparison to
the happiness enjoyed in the impersonal Brahman, and this brahmananda, the
spiritual bliss derived from impersonal Brahman, is like the water in the hoofprint
of a calf compared to the ocean of love of Godhead. When one develops pure love
for the Lord, he derives an ocean of transcendental happiness from the association
of the Personality of Godhead. To qualify oneself to reach this stage of life is the
highest perfection.

One should try to purchase a ticket to go back home, back to Godhead. The
price of such a ticket is one’s intense desire for it, which is not easily awakened,
even if one continuously performs pious activities for thousands of lives. All mun-
dane relationships are sure to be broken in the course of time, but once one
establishes a relationship with the Personality of Godhead in a particular rasa, it is
never to be broken, even after the annihilation of the material world.

One should understand, through the transparent medium of the spiritual master,
that the Supreme Lord exists everywhere in His transcendental spiritual nature
and that the living entities’ relationships with the Lord are directly and indirectly
existing everywhere, even in this material world. In the spiritual world there are
five kinds of relationships with the Supreme Lord—s$anta, dasya, sakhya, vatsalya
and madhurya. The perverted reflections of these rasas are found in the material
world. Land, home, furniture and other inert material objects are related in santa,
or the neutral and silent sense, whereas servants work in the dasya relationship.
The reciprocation between friends is called sakhya, the affection of a parent for a
child is known as vatsalya, and the affairs of conjugal love constitute madhurya.
These five relationships in the material world are distorted reflections of the original
pure sentiments, which should be understood and perfected in relationship with the
Supreme Personality of Godhead under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master.
In the material world the perverted rasas bring frustration. If these rasas are re-
established with Lord Krsna, the result is eternal blissful life.

From this and the preceding three verses of Caitanya-caritamrta, which have
been selected from the Srimad-Bhagavatam, the missionary activities of Lord
Caitanya can be understood. Srimad-Bhagavatam has 18,000 verses, which are
summarized in the four verses beginning with aham evasam evagre (53) and con-


--- Page 61 ---
58 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta
cluding with yat syat sarvatra sarvada (56). In the first of these verses (53) the
transcendental nature of Lord Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is
explained. The second verse (54) further explains that the Lord is detached from
the workings of the material energy, maya. The living entities, as parts and parcels
of Lord Krsna, are prone to be controlled by the external energy because although
they are spiritual, in the material world they are encased in bodies of material
energy. The eternal relationship of the living entities with the Supreme Lord is ex-
plained in that verse. The next verse (55) instructs that the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, by His inconceivable energies, is simultaneously one with and different
from the living entities and the material energy. This knowledge is called acintya-
bhedabheda-tattva. When an individual living entity surrenders to Lord Krsna, he
can then develop natural transcendental love for the Supreme Lord. This surrender-
ing process should be the primary concern of a human being. In the next verse (56)
it is said that a conditioned soul must ultimately approach a bona fide spiritual
master and try to understand perfectly the material and spiritual worlds and his
own existential position. Here the words anvaya-vyatirekabhyam, ‘directly and
indirectly,” suggest that one must learn the process of devotional service in its two
aspects: one must directly execute the process of devotional service and indirectly
avoid the impediments to progress.

desire trees, Jayasri [Radharani] enjoys the transcendental mellow of an eternal
consort.”

PURPORT

This verse is from the Krspa-karpamta, which was written by a great Vaisnava
sannyasi named Bilvamangala Thakura, who is also known as Lilasuka. He intensely
desired to enter into the eternal pastimes of the Lord, and he lived at Vgndavana for
seven hundred years in the vicinity of Brahma-kunda, a still existing bathing tank in
৬0703431713. The history of Bilvamangala Thakura is given in a book called 6
Vallabha-digvijaya. He appeared in the Eighth Century Saka Era in the province of
Dravida and was the chief disciple of Visnusvami. In a list of temples and monaster-
ies kept in Sarikaracirya’s monastery in Dvaraka, Bilvamarigala is mentioned as the
founder of the Dvarakadhisa Temple there. He entrusted the service of his Deity to
Hari Brahmacari, a disciple of Vallabha Bhatta.

Bilvamarigala Thakura actually entered into the transcendental pastimes of Lord
Krsna. He has recorded his transcendental experiences and appreciation in the book
known as Krspa-karpampta. In the beginning of that book he has offered his obei-
sances to his different gurus, and it is to be noted that he has adored them all
equally. The first spiritual master mentioned is Cintamani, who was his instructing
spiritual master because she first showed him the spiritual path. Cintamani was a
prostitute with whom Bilvamarigala was intimate earlier in his life. She gave him the
inspiration to begin on the path of devotional service, and because she convinced
him to give up material existence to try for perfection by loving Krsna, he has first
offered his respects to her. Next he offers his respects to his initiating spiritual
master, Somagiri, and then to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who was also
his instructing spiritual master. He explicitly mentions Bhagavan, who has peacock
feathers on His crown, because the Lord of V(ndavana, Krsna the cowherd boy,
used to come to Bilvamangala to talk with him and supply him with milk. In his
adoration of Sri Krsna, the Personality of Godhead, he describes that | ayasri, the
goddess of fortune, Srimati’ Radharani, takes shelter in the shade of His lotus feet
to enjoy the transcendental rasa of nuptial love. The complete treatise Krsna-
karpamyrta is dedicated to the transcendental pastimes of Sri Krsna and Srimati’
Radharani. It is a book to be read and understood by the most elevated devotees of
Sri Krsna.

It is not possible for a conditioned soul to directly meet Krsna, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, but if one becomes a sincere devotee and seriously engages
in devotional service, Lord Krsna sends an instructing spiritual master to show him
favor and invoke his dormant propensity for serving the Supreme. The preceptor
appears before the external senses of the fortunate conditioned soul, and at the
same time the devotee is guided from within by the caittyaguru, Krsna, who is
seated as the spiritual master within the heart of the living entity.

This verse, which appears in the Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.26.26), was spoken by
Lord Krspa to Uddhava in the text known as the Uddhava-gita. The discussion re-
lates to the story of Purlirava and the heavenly courtesan Urvasi. When {17४25 left

Puriirava, he was deeply affected by the separation and had to learn to overcome his
grief.

It is indicated that to learn the transcendental science, it is imperative that one
avoid the company of undesirable persons and always seek the company of saints
and sages who are able to impart lessons of transcendental knowledge. The potent
words of such realized souls penetrate the heart, thereby eradicating all misgivings
accumulated by years of undesirable association. For a neophyte devotee there are
two kinds of persons whose association is undesirable: (1) gross materialists who
constantly engage in sense gratification and (2) unbelievers who do not serve the
Supreme Personality of Godhead but serve their senses and their mental whims in
terms of their speculative habits. Intelligent persons seeking transcendental realiza-
tion should very scrupulously avoid their company.

“The spiritually powerful message of Godhead can be properly discussed only in
a society of devotees, and it is greatly pleasing to hear in that association. If one
hears from devotees, the way of transcendental experience quickly opens to him,
and gradually he attains a taste in knowledge that in due course develops into
attraction and devotion.”

PURPORT

This verse appears in the Srimad-Bhagavatam (3.25.25), where Kapiladeva replies

to the questions of His mother, Devahiti, about the process of devotional service. As


--- Page 65 ---
62 Sri Caitanya-caritimrta
one advances in devotional activities, the process becomes progressively clearer and
more encouraging. Unless one gets this spiritual encouragement by following the
instructions of the spiritual master, it is not possible to make advancement. There-
fore, one’s development of a taste for executing these instructions is the test of
one’s devotional service. ‘Initially, one must develop confidence by hearing the
science of devotion from a qualified spiritual master. Then, as he associates with
devotees and tries to adopt the means instructed by the spiritual master in his own
life, his misgivings and other obstacles are vanquished by his execution of devotional
service. Strong attachment for the transcendental service of the Lord develops as he
continues listening to the messages of Godhead, and if he steadfastly proceeds in
this way, he is certainly elevated to spontaneous love for the Supreme Personality
of Godhead.

A pure devotee constantly engaged in the loving service of the Lord is identical

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is one without a second, and therefore He is
all-powerful. He has inconceivable energies, of which three are principal. The devo-
tee is considered to be one of these energies, never the energetic. The energetic is
always the Supreme Lord. The energies are related to Him for the purpose of eternal
service. A living entity in the conditional stage can uncover his aptitude for serving
the Absolute Truth by the grace of Krsna and the spiritual master. Then the Lord
reveals Himself within his heart, and he can know that Krsna is seated in the heart
of every pure devotee. Krsna is actually situated in the heart of every living entity,
but only a devotee can realize this fact.

PURPORT

This verse appears in the Srimad-Bhagavatam (9.4.68) in connection with a mis-
understanding between Durvasa Muni and Maharaja Ambarisa. As a result of this
misunderstanding, Durvasa Muni tried to kill the King, when the Sudarsana cakra,
the celebrated weapon of Godhead, appeared on the scene for the devoted King’s
protection. When the Sudarsana cakra attacked Durvasa Muni, he fled in fear of
the weapon and sought shelter from all the great demigods in heaven. Every one of
them was unable to protect him, and therefore Durvasa Muni prayed to Lord Vispu
for forgiveness. Lord Visnu advised him, however, that if he wanted forgiveness he
had to get it from Maharaja Ambarisa, not from Him. In this context Lord Vispu
spoke this verse.

The Lord, being full and free from problems, can wholeheartedly care for His
devotees. His concern is how to elevate and protect all those who have taken shelter
at His feet. The same responsibility is also entrusted to the spiritual master. The
bona fide spiritual master’s concern is how the devotees who have surrendered to
him as a representative of the Lord may make progress in devotional service. The
Supreme Personality of Godhead is always mindful of the devotees who fully en-
gage in cultivating knowledge of Him, having taken shelter at His lotus feet.

This verse was spoken by Maharaja Yudhisthira to Vidura in the S$rimad-
Bhagavatam (1.13.10). Maharaja Yudhisthira was receiving his saintly uncle Vidura,
who had been visiting sacred places of pilgrimage. Maharaja Yudhisthira told Vidura
that pure devotees like him are personified holy places because the Supreme Person-
ality of Godhead is always with them in their hearts. By their association, sinful
persons are freed from sinful reactions, and therefore wherever a pure devotee goes
is a sacred place of pilgrimage. The importance of holy places is due to the presence
there of such pure devotees.

The Personality of Godhead exhibits Himself in two kinds of forms: prakasa
and vilasa.
PURPORT
The Supreme Lord expands His personal forms in two primary categories. The
prakdsa forms are manifested by Lord Krsna for His pastimes, and their features
are exactly like His. When Lord Krsna married sixteen thousand queens in Dvaraka,
He did so in sixteen thousand prakasa expansions. Similarly, during the rasa dance
He expanded Himself in identical prakdsa forms to dance beside each and every
gopi simultaneously. When the Lord manifests His vilasa expansions, however, they
are all somewhat different in their bodily features. Lord Balarama is the first
vildsa expansion of Lord Krsna, and the four-handed Narayana forms in Vaikuntha
expand from Balarama. There is no difference between the bodily forms of Sri
Krsna and Balarama except that Their bodily colors are different. Similarly, <न
Narayana in Vaikuntha has four hands, whereas Krsna has only two. The expansions
of the Lord who manifest such bodily differences are known as vildsa-vigrahas.

TRANSLATION

“The great scripture $rimad-Bhagavatam, compiled by Mahamuni Vyasadeva from
four original verses, describes the most elevated and kindhearted devotees and com-
pletely rejects the cheating ways of materially motivated religiosity. It propounds
the highest principle of eternal religion, which can factually mitigate the threefold
miseries of a living being and award the highest benediction of full prosperity and
knowledge. Those willing to hear the message of this scripture in a submissive atti-
tude of service can at once capture the Supreme Lord in their hearts. Therefore
there is no need for any scripture other than $rimad-Bhagavatam.”

PURPORT

This verse appears in the Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.1.2). The words mahamuni-krte
indicate that Srimad-Bhagavatam was compiled by the great sage Vyasadeva, whois
sometimes known as Narayana Mahamuni because he is an incarnation of Narayana.
Vyasadeva, therefore, is not an ordinary man, but is empowered by the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. He compiled the beautiful BhAdgavatam to narrate some of
the pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His devotees.

In $rimad-Bhagavatam, a distinction between real religion and pretentious religion
has been clearly made. According to this original and genuine commentation on the
Vedanta-satra, there are numerous pretentious faiths that pass as religion but neglect
the real essence of religion. The real religion of a living being is his natural inborn
quality, whereas pretentious religion is a form of nescience that artificially coversa
living entity's pure consciousness under certain unfavorable conditions. Real religion
lies dormant when artificial religion dominates from the mental plane. A living
being can awaken this dormant religion by hearing with a pure heart.

The path of religion prescribed by Srimad-Bhagavatam is different from all forms
of imperfect religiosity. Religion can be considered in the following three divisions:
(1) the path of fruitive work, (2) the path of knowledge and mystic powers, and
(3) the path of worship and devotional service.

The path of fruitive work (karma-kapda), even when decorated by religious
ceremonies meant to elevate one’s material condition, is a cheating process because
it can never enable one to gain relief from material existence and achieve the highest
goal. A living entity perpetually struggles hard to rid himself of the pangs of mate-
rial existence, but the path of fruitive work leads him to either temporary happiness
or temporary distress in material existence. By pious fruitive work one is placed in a
position where he can temporarily feel material happiness, whereas vicious activities


--- Page 80 ---
01413, Chapter 1 77
lead one to a distressful position of material want and scarcity. However, even if one
is put into the most perfect situation of material happiness, he cannot in that way
become free from the pangs of birth, death, old age and disease. A materially happy
person is therefore in need of the eternal relief that mundane religiosity in terms of
fruitive work can never award.

The paths of the culture of knowledge (jridna-mdrga) and of mystic powers (yoga-
marga) are equally hazardous, for one does not know where he will go by following
these uncertain methods. An empiric philosopher in search of spiritual knowledge
may endeavor most laboriously for many, many births in mental speculation, but
unless and until he reaches the stage of the purest quality of goodness—in other
words, until he transcends the plane of material speculation—it is not possible for
him to know that everything emanates from the Personality of Godhead Vasudeva.
His attachment to the impersonal feature of the Supreme Lord makes him unfit to
rise to that transcendental stage of wdsudeva understanding, and therefore because
of his unclean state of mind he glides down again into material existence, even after
having ascended to the highest stage of liberation. This falldown takes place due to
his want of a focus standj in the service of the Supreme Lord.

As far as the mystic powers of the yogis are concerned, they are also material
entanglements on the path of spiritual realization. One German scholar who became a
devotee of Godhead in India said that material science had already made laudable
progress in duplicating the mystic powers of the yogis. He therefore came to India
not to learn the methods of the yogis’ mystic powers but to learn the path of tran-
scendental loving service to the Supreme Lord, as mentioned in the great scripture
Srimad-Bhagavatam. Mystic powers can make a yogi materially powerful and thus
give temporary relief from the miseries of birth, death, old age and disease, as other
material sciences can also do, but such mystic powers can never be a permanent
source of relief from these miseries. Therefore, according to the Bhdgavata school,
this path of religiosity is also a method of cheating its followers. In Bhagavad-gita it
is clearly defined that the most elevated and powerful mystic yogi is one who can
constantly think of the Supreme Lord within his heart and engage in the loving
service of the Lord.

The path of worship of the innumerable 06৮৫5, or administrative demigods, is still
more hazardous and uncertain than the above-mentioned processes of karma-kapda
and jndna-kdnda. This system of worshiping many gods, such as Durga, Siva,
Ganesa, Surya and the impersonal Visnu form, is accepted by persons who have
been blinded by an intense desire for sense gratification. When properly executed
in terms of the rites mentioned in the sastras, which are now very difficult to
perform in this age of want and scarcity, such worship can certainly fulfill one’s
desires for sense gratification, but the success obtained by such methods is certainly
transient, and it is suitable only for a less intelligent person. That is the verdict of
Bhagavad-gita. No sane man should be satisfied by such temporary benefits.

None of the above-mentioned three religious paths can deliver a person from the
threefold miseries of material existence, namely, miseries caused by the body and
mind, miseries caused by other living entities, and miseries caused by the demigods.
The process of religion described in Srimad-Bhagavatam, however, is able to give


--- Page 81 ---
78 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta

its followers permanent relief from the threefold miseries. The Bhagavatam describes
the highest religious form—reinstatement of the living entity in his original position
of transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord, which is free from the infec-
tions of desires for sense gratification, fruitive work, and the culture of knowledge
with the aim of merging in the Absolute to become one with the Supreme Lord.

Any process of religiosity based on sense gratification, gross or subtle, must be
considered a pretentious religion because it is unable to give perpetual protection to
its followers. The word projjhita is significant. Pra means complete, and wjjhita indi-
cates rejection. Religiosity in the shape of fruitive work is directly a method of gross
sense gratification, whereas the process of culturing spiritual knowledge with a view
to becoming one with the Absolute is a method of subtle sense gratification. All such
pretentious religiosity based on gross or subtle sense gratification is completely
rejected in the process of bhdgavata-dharma, or the transcendental religion that is an
eternal function for the living being.

Bhagavata-dharma, or the religious principle described in Srimad-Bhdgavatam, of
which Bhagavad-gita is a preliminary study, is meant for liberated persons of the
highest order who attribute very little value to the sense gratification of pretentious
religiosity. The first and foremost concern of fruitive workers, elevationists,empiric
philosophers and salvationists is to raise their material position. But devotees of
Godhead have no such selfish desires. They serve the Supreme Lord only for His
satisfaction. Sri Arjuna, wanting to satisfy his senses by becoming a so-called non-
violent and pious man, at first decided not to fight. But when he was fully situated in
the principles of bhdgavata-dharma, culminating in complete surrender unto the will
of the Supreme Lord, he changed his decision and agreed to fight for the satisfaction
of the Lord. He then said:

nasto mohah smytir labdha
tvat-prasadan maydcyuta
sthito 'smi gata-sandehah
karisye vacanari tava
“My dear Krsna, O infallible one, my illusion is now gone. | have regained my
memory by Your mercy, and | am now firm and free from doubt and am prepared
to act according to Your instructions.” (Bg. 18.73) It is the constitutional position
of a living entity to be situated in this pure consciousness. Any so-called religious
process that interferes with this unadulterated spiritual position of the living being
must therefore be considered a pretentious process of religiosity.

The real form of religion is spontaneous loving service to Godhead. This relation-
ship of the living being with the Absolute Personality of Godhead in service is
eternal. The Personality of Godhead is described as vastu, or the Substance, and the
living entities are described as vdstavas, or the innumerable samples of the Substance
in relative existence. The relationship of these substantive portions with the Supreme
Substance can ०९४६ be annihilated, for it is an eternal quality inherent in the living
being.


--- Page 82 ---
01413, Chapter 1 79
By contact with material nature the living entities exhibit varied symptoms of the
disease of material consciousness. To cure this material disease is the supreme object
of human life. The process that treats this disease is called bhagavata-dharma or
sanatana-dharma—real religion. This is described in the pages of Srimad-Bhagavatam.
Therefore anyone who, because of his background of pious activities in previous
lives, is anxious to hear, immediately realizes the presence of the Supreme Lord
within his heart and fulfills the mission of his life.

All kinds of activities, both auspicious and inauspicious, that are detrimental to

PURPORT
The poetical comparison of Lord Caitanya and Lord Nityananda to the sun and
moon is very significant. The living entities are spiritual sparks, and their constitu-
tional position is in devotional service to the Supreme Lord in full Krsna conscious-
ness. So-called pious activities and other ritualistic performances, pious or impious,
as well as the desire to escape from material existence, are all considered to be
coverings of these spiritual sparks. The living entities must get free from these super-
fluous coverings and fully engage in Krsna consciousness. The purpose of the appear-
ance of Lord Caitanya and Lord Nityananda is to dispel the darkness of the soul.
Before Their appearance, all these superfluous activities of the living entities were
covering Krsna consciousness, but after the appearance of these two brothers,
people’s hearts are becoming cleansed, and they are again becoming situated in the
real position of Krsna consciousness.

PURPORT

The celebrated ancient capital of the Sena dynasty, which was known as
Gaudade$a or Gauda, was situated in what is now the modern district of Maldah.
Later this capital was transferred to the ninth or central island on the western side
of the Ganges at Navadvipa, which is now known as Mayapur and was then called
Gaudapura. Lord Caitanya appeared there, and Lord Nityananda came there and
joined Him from the district of Birbhum. They appeared on the horizon of
(७2५५०५९६ to spread the science of Krsna consciousness, and it is predicted that as
the sun and moon gradually move west, the movement They began five hundred
years ago will come to the western civilizations by Their mercy.

Caitanya Mahaprabhu and Nityananda Prabhu drive away the five kinds of ignor-
ance of the conditioned souls. In the Mahabharata, Udyoga-parva, Forty-third
Chapter, these five kinds of ignorance are described. They are (1) accepting the body
to be the self, (2) making material sense gratification one’s standard of enjoyment,
(3) being anxious due to material identification, (4) lamenting and (5) thinking that
there is anything beyond the Absolute Truth. The teachings of Lord Caitanya
eradicate these five kinds of ignorance. Whatever one sees or otherwise experiences
one should know to be simply an exhibition of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead'’s energy. Everything is a manifestation of Krsna.

This chapter explains that Lord Caitanya is the Supreme Personality of Godhead
Krsna Himself. Therefore, the Brahman effulgence is the bodily luster of Lord
Caitanya, and the localized Supersoul situated in the heart of every living entity is
His partial representation. The purusa-avataras are also explained in this connection.
Maha-Visnu is the reservoir of all conditioned souls, but as confirmed in the authori-
tative scriptures, Lord Krsna is the ultimate fountainhead, the source of numerous
plenary expansions, including Narayana, who is generally accepted by Mayavadi
philosophers to be the Absolute Truth. The [01015 manifestation of prabhava and
vaibhava expansions, as well as partial incarnations and incarnations with delegated
powers, are also explained. Lord Krsna's ages of boyhood and youth. are discussed,
and it is explained that His age at the beginning of youth is His eternal form.

The spiritual sky contains innumerable spiritual planets, the Vaikunthas, which
are manifestations of the Supreme Lord’s internal energy. Innumerable material
universes are similarly exhibited by His external energy, and the living entities are
manifested by His marginal energy. Because Lord Krsna Caitanya is not different
from Lord Krsna, He is the cause of all causes; there is no cause beyond Him. He is
eternal, and His form is spiritual. Lord Caitanya is directly the Supreme Lord Krsna,
as the evidence of authoritative scriptures proves. This chapter stresses that a
devotee must have knowledge of Krsna's personal form, His three principal energies,
His pastimes and the relationship of the living entities with Him in order to advance
in Krsna consciousness.

By the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead € Caitanya Mahaprabhu,
even an inexperienced boy with no educational culture can be saved from the ocean

sentations of the janis, the yoga systems of Patarijali and Gautama, and the systems
of philosophers like Kanada, Kapila and Dattatreya are dangerous creatures in the
ocean of nescience. By the grace of $iT Caitanya Mahaprabhu one can have real
understanding of the essence of knowledge by avoiding these sectarian views and
accepting the lotus feet of Krsna as the ultimate goal of life. Let us all worship
Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu for His gracious mercy to the conditioned souls.

Adi-lila, Chapter 2 91
TRANSLATION

O my merciful Lord Caitanya, may the nectarean Ganges waters of Your transcen-
dental activities flow on the surface of my 06591041106 tongue. Beautifying these
waters are the lotus flowers of singing, dancing and loud chanting of Krsna’s holy
name, which are the pleasure abodes of unalloyed devotees. These devotees are
compared to swans, ducks and bees. The river’s flowing produces a melodious
sound that gladdens their ears.

PURPORT

Our tongues always engage in vibrating useless sounds that do not help us realize
transcendental peace. The tongue is compared to a desert because a desert needs a
constant supply of refreshing water to make it fertile and fruitful. Water is the
substance most needed in the desert. The transient pleasure derived from mundane
topics of art, culture, politics, sociology, dry philosophy, poetry and so on is com
pared to a mere drop of water because although such topics have a qualitative
feature of transcendental pleasure, they are saturated with the modes of material
nature. Therefore neither collectively nor individually can they satisfy the vast
requirements of the desert-like tongue. Despite crying in various conferences, there-
fore, the desert-like tongue continues to be parched. For this reason, people from
all parts of the world must call for the devotees of Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu,
who are compared to swans swimming around the beautiful lotus feet of इन Caitanya
Mahaprabhu or bees humming around His lotus feet in transcendental pleasure,
searching for honey. The dryness of material happiness cannot be moistened by
so-called philosophers who cry for Brahman, liberation and similar dry speculative
objects. The urge of the soul proper is different. The soul can be solaced only by
the mercy of Lord $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and His many bona fide devotees, who
never leave the lotus feet of the Lord to become imitation Mahaprabhus, but all
cling to His lotus feet like bees that never leave a honey-soaked lotus flower.

Lord Caitanya’s movement of Krsna consciousness is full of dancing and singing
about the pastimes of Lord Krsna. It is compared herein to the pure waters of the
Ganges, which are full of lotus flowers. The enjoyers of these lotus flowers are the
pure devotees, who are like bees and swans. They chant like the flowing of the
Ganges, the river of the celestial kingdom. The author desires such sweetly flowing
waves to cover his tongue. He humbly compares himself to materialistic persons
who always engage in dry talk from which they derive no satisfaction. If they were
to use their dry tongues to chant the holy name of the Lord—Hare Krsna, Hare
Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rima, Rima Rima, Hare Hare—
as exemplified by Lord Caitanya, they would taste sweet nectar and enjoy life.

TRANSLATION

What the Upanisads describe as the impersonal Brahman is but the effulgence of
His body, and the Lord known as the Supersoul is but His localized plenary portion.
He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna Himself, full with six opulences. He
is the Absolute Truth, and no other truth is greater than or equal to Him.

PURPORT

The compilers of the Upanisads speak very highly of the impersonal Brahman.
The Upanisads, which are considered the most elevated portion of the Vedic litera-
tures, are meant for persons who desire to get free from material association and
who therefore approach a bona fide spiritual master for enlightenment. The prefix
upa indicates that one must receive knowledge about the Absolute Truth from a
spiritual master. One who has faith in his spiritual master actually receives transcen-
dental instruction, and as his attachment for material life slackens, he is able to
advance on the spiritual path. Knowledge of the transcendental science of the
Upanisads can free one from the entanglement of existence in the material world,
and when thus liberated, one can be elevated to the spiritual kingdom of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead by advancement in spiritual life.

The beginning of spiritual enlightenment is realization of impersonal Brahman.
Such realization is effected by gradual negation of material variegatedness. |mper-
sonal Brahman realization is the partial, distant experience of the Absolute Truth
that one achieves through the rational approach. It is compared to one’s seeing a
hill from a distance and taking it to be a smoky cloud. A hill is not a smoky cloud,
but it appears to be one from a distance because of our imperfect vision. In imper-
fect or smoky realization of the Absolute Truth, spiritual variegatedness is con-
spicuous by its absence. This experience is therefore called advaita-vada, or realiza-
tion of the oneness of the Absolute.

The impersonal glowing effulgence of Brahman consists only of the personal
bodily rays of the Supreme Godhead, $r Krsna. Since ও] Gaurasundara, or Lord
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, is identical with $f Krsna Himself, the Brahman efful-
gence consists of the rays of His transcendental body.

Similarly, the Supersoul, which is called the Paramatma, is a plenary representa-
tion of Caitanya Mahaprabhu. The antaryami, the Supersoul in everyone's heart, is


--- Page 96 ---
94 Sri Caitanya-caritimyta

the controller of all living entities. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita, wherein Lord
Krsna says, sarvasya caham hrdi sannivistah: “| am situated in everyone's heart.”
(Bg. 15.15) Bhagavad-gita also states (Bg. 5.29), bhoktdararh yajia-tapasarm sarva-
loka-mahesvaram, indicating that the Supreme Lord, acting in His expansion as the
Supersoul, is the proprietor of everything. Similarly, the Brahma-sarhhita states,
apdantara-stha-paramanu-cayantara-stham: the Lord is present everywhere, within
the heart of every living entity and within each and every atom as well. Thus by
this Supersoul feature the Lord is all-pervading.

Furthermore, Lord Caitanya is also the master of all wealth, strength, fame,
beauty, knowledge and renunciation because He is Sri Krsna Himself. He is described
25 piarpa, or complete. In the feature of Lord Caitanya, the Lord is an ideal
renouncer, just as 917 Rima was an ideal king. He accepted the order of sannydsa and
exemplified exceedingly wonderful principles in His own life. No one can compare
to Him in the order of sannyasa. Although in Kali-yuga acceptance of the sannydsa
order is generally forbidden, Lord Caitanya accepted it because He is complete in
renunciation. Others cannot imitate Him but can only follow in His footsteps as
far as possible. Those who are unfit for this order of life are strictly forbidden by
the injunctions of the $astras to accept it. Lord Caitanya, however, is complete in
renunciation as well as all other opulences. He is therefore the highest principle of
the Absolute Truth.

By an analytical study of the truth of Lord Caitanya, one will find that He is not
different from the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krsna; no one is greater than
or even equal to Him. In Bhagavad-gita Lord Krsna says 10 Arjuna, mattah paratarari
nanyat kificid asti dhanafijaya: “‘O conquerer of wealth [Arjuna], there is no truth
superior to Me.” (Bg. 7.7) Thus it is here confirmed that there is no truth higher
than Lord Sri Krsna Caitanya.

The impersonal Brahman is the goal of those who cultivate the study of books of
transcendental knowledge, and the Supersoul is the goal of those who perform the
yoga practices. One who knows the Supreme Personality of Godhead surpasses
realization of both Brahman and Paramatma because Bhagavan is the ultimate
platform of absolute knowledge.

The Personality of Godhead is the complete form of sac-cid-Gnanda (full life,
knowledge and bliss). By realization of the sat portion of the Complete Whole
(unlimited existence), one realizes the impersonal Brahman of the Lord. By realiza-
tion of the cit portion of the Complete Whole (unlimited knowledge), one can
realize the localized aspect of the Lord, Paramatma. But neither of these partial
realizations of the Complete Whole can help one realize ananda, or complete bliss.
Without such realization of dnanda, knowledge of the Absolute Truth is incomplete.

This verse of Caitanya-caritamrta by Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvamt is confirmed by
a parallel statement in the Tattva-sandarbha by Srila Jiva Gosvami. In the Eighth
Part of Tattva-sandarbha it is said that the Absolute Truth is sometimes approached
as impersonal Brahman, which, although spiritual, is only a partial representation
of the Absolute Truth. Narayana, the predominating Deity in Vaikuntha, is to be
known as an expansion of Sri Krsna, but Sri Krsna is the Supreme Absolute Truth,
the object of the transcendental love of all living entities.

PURPORT

According to the rules of rhetorical arrangement for efficient composition in
literature, a subject should be mentioned before its predicate. The Vedic literature
frequently mentions Brahman, Paramatma and Bhagavan, and therefore these three
terms are widely known as the subjects of transcendental understanding. But it is
not widely known that what is approached as the impersonal Brahman is the
effulgence of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s transcendental body. Nor is it widely
known that the Supersoul, or Paramatma, is only a partial representation of Lord
Caitanya, who is identical with Bhagavan Himself. Therefore the descriptions of
Brahman as the effulgence of Lord Caitanya, 02121102 11117 as His partial representa-
tion, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krsna as identical with Lord Caitanya
Mahdprabhu must be verified by evidence from authoritative Vedic literatures.

The author wants to establish first that the essence of the Vedas is visnu-tattva,
the Absolute Truth, Visnu, the all-pervading Godhead. The visnu-tattva has different
categories, of which the highest is Lord Krsna, the ultimate vispu-tattva, as confirmed


--- Page 99 ---
Adi-lila, Chapter 2 97
in Bhagavad-gitd and throughout the Vedic literature. In the Srimad-Bhagavatam
the same Supreme Personality of Godhead Krsna is described as Nandasuta, the son
of King Nanda. Krsnadasa Kavirdja Gosvami says that Nandasuta has again appeared
as Lord Sri Krsna Caitanya Mahiprabhu because the conclusion of the Vedic
literature is that there is no difference between Lord Krsna and Lord Caitanya
14317301367. This the author will prove. If it is thus proved that Sri Krsna is the
origin of all tattvas (truths), namely, Brahman, Paramatmi and Bhagavan, and that
there is no difference between Sri Krsna and Lord Sri Caitanya Mahiprabhu, it will
not be difficult to understand that Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is 2150 the same origin
of all tattvas. The same Absolute Truth, as He is revealed to students of different
realizations, is called Brahman, Paramatma and Bhagavan.

TRANSLATION
In terms of His various manifestations, He is known in three features, called the

Godhead.
PURPORT
Srila Jiva Gosvami has explained the word bhagavan in his Bhagavat-sandarbha.
The Personality of Godhead, being full of all conceivable and inconceivable poten-
cies, is the absolute Supreme Whole. Impersonal Brahman is a partial manifestation
of the Absolute Truth realized in the absence of such complete potencies. The first
syllable of the word bhagavdn is bha, which means “50503117611” and ‘‘protector.”
The next letter, ga, means “leader,” “pusher” and ‘“‘creator.” Va means “dwelling”
(all living beings dwell in the Supreme Lord, and the Supreme Lord dwells within
the heart of every living being). Combining all these concepts, the word bhagavan
carries the import of inconceivable potency in knowledge, energy, strength, opu-
lence, power and influence, devoid of all varieties of inferiority. Without such
inconceivable potencies, one cannot fully sustain or protect. Our modern civilization
is sustained by scientific arrangements devised by many great scientific brains. We


--- Page 100 ---
98 नं Caitanya-caritamrta

can just imagine, therefore, the gigantic brain whose arrangements sustain the gravity
of the unlimited number of planets and satellites and who creates the unlimited
space in which they float. If one considers the intelligence needed to orbit man-made
satellites, one cannot be fooled into thinking that there is not a gigantic intelligence
responsible for the arrangements of the various planetary systems. There is no
reason to believe that all the gigantic planets float in space without the superior
arrangement of a superior intelligence. This subject is clearly dealt with in Bhagavad-
gita, where the Personality of Godhead says, “1 enter into each planet, and by My
energy they stay in orbit.” (Bg. 15.13) Were the planets not held in the grip of the
Personality of Godhead, they would all scatter like dust in the air. Modern scientists
can only impractically explain this inconceivable strength of the Personality of
Godhead.

The potencies of the syllables bha, ga and va apply in terms of many different
meanings. Through His different potential agents, the Lord protects and sustains
everything, but He Himself personally protects and sustains only His devotees, just
as a king personally sustains and protects his own children, while entrusting the
protection and sustenance of the state to various administrative agents. The Lord is
the leader of His devotees, as we learn from Bhagavad-gita, which mentions that the
Personality of Godhead personally instructs His loving devotees how to make certain
progress on the path of devotion and thus surely approach the kingdom of God.
The Lord is also the recipient of all the adoration offered by His devotees, for whom
He is the objective and the goal. For His devotees the Lord creates a favorable con-
dition for developing a sense of transcendental love of Godhead. Sometimes He
does this by taking away a devotee’s material attachments by force and baffling all
his material protective agents, for thus the devotee must completely depend on the
Lord’s protection. In this way the Lord proves Himself the leader of His devotees.

The Lord is not directly attached to the creation, maintenance and destruction
of the material world, for He is eternally busy in the enjoyment of transcendental
bliss with His internal potential paraphernalia. Yet as the initiator of the material
energy as well as the marginal potency (the living beings), He expands Himself as
the purusa-avatdras, who are invested with potencies similar to His. The purusa-
avatdras are also in the category of bhagavat-tattva because each and every one of
them is identical with the original form of the Personality of Godhead. The living
entities are His infinitesimal particles and are qualitatively one with Him. They are
sent into this material world for material enjoyment to fulfill their desires to be
independent individuals, but still they are subject to the supreme will of the Lord.
The Lord deputes Himself in the state of Supersoul to supervise the arrangements
for such material enjoyment. The example of a temporary fair is quite appropriate
in this connection. If the citizens of a state assemble in a fair to enjoy for a short
period, the government deputes a special officer to supervise it. Such an officer is
invested with all governmental power, and therefore he is identical with the govern-
ment. When the fair is over, there is no need of such an officer, and he returns home.
Such an officer is compared to the Paramatma.

The living beings are not all in all. They are undoubtedly parts of the Supreme
Lord and are qualitatively one with Him; yet they are subject to His control. Thus


--- Page 101 ---
40113, Chapter 2 99
they are never equal to the Lord or one with Him. The Lord who associates with
the living being is the Paramatma or supreme living being. No one, therefore, should
view the tiny living beings and supreme living being to be on an equal level.

The all-pervading truth which exists eternally during the creation, maintenance
and annihilation of the material world and in which the living beings rest in trance
is called the impersonal Brahman.

PURPORT

This Sanskrit verse appears as the eleventh verse of the First Canto, Second
Chapter, of Srimad-Bhagavatam, where 5612 Gosvami answers the questions of the
sages headed by Saunaka Rsi concerning the essence of all scriptural instructions.
Tattva-vidah refers to persons who have knowledge of the Absolute Truth. They can
certainly understand knowledge without duality because they are on the spiritual
platform. The Absolute Truth is known sometimes as Brahman, sometimes as
Paramatma and sometimes as Bhagavan. Persons who are in knowledge of the truth
know that one who tries to approach the Absolute simply by mental speculation
will ultimately realize the impersonal Brahman, and one who tries to approach the
Absolute through yoga practice will be able to realize Paramatma, but one who has
complete knowledge and spiritual understanding realizes the spiritual form of
Bhagavan, the Personality of Godhead.

Devotees of the Personality of Godhead know that Sri Krsna, the son of the King
of Vraja, is the Absolute Truth. They do not discriminate between Sri Krsna’s name,
form, quality and pastimes. One who wants to separate the Lord’s absolute name,
form and qualities must be understood to be lacking in absolute knowledge. A pure


--- Page 102 ---
100 इन Caitanya-caritaimrta
devotee knows that when he chants the transcendental name Krsna, Sri Krsna is
present as transcendental sound. He therefore chants with full respect and veneration.
When he sees the forms of Sri Krsna, he does not see anything different from the
Lord. If one sees otherwise, he must be considered untrained in absolute knowledge.
This lack of absolute knowledge is called maya. One who is not Krsna conscious is
ruled by the spell of maya under the control of a duality in knowledge. In the
Absolute, all manifestations of the Supreme Lord are nondual, just as the multi-
farious forms of Visnu, the controller of maya, are nondual. Empiric philosophers
who pursue the impersonal Brahman accept only the knowledge that the personality
of the living entity is not different from the personality of the Supreme Lord, and
mystic yogls who try to locate the Paramatma accept only the knowledge that the
pure soul is not different from the Supersoul. The absolute conception of a pure
devotee, however, includes all others. A devotee does not see anything except in its
relationship with Krsna, and therefore his realization is the most perfect of all.

illumination. That Brahman is in front and in back, in the north, south, east and

spreads throughout both the material and spiritual skies.”

This verse appears in the Brahma-samhita (5.40). Each and every one of the
countless universes is full of innumerable planets with different constitutions and

Whole, which exists in absolute knowledge. The origin of that unlimited Brahman
effulgence is the transcendental body of Govinda, who is offered respectful
obeisances as the original and supreme Personality of Godhead.

Although the sun is situated far away from the other planets, its rays sustain and
maintain them all. Indeed, the sun diffuses its heat and light all over the universe.
Similarly, the supreme sun, Govinda, diffuses His heat and light everywhere in the
form of His different potencies. The sun’s heat and light are nondifferent from the
sun. In the same way, the unlimited potencies of Govinda are nondifferent from
Govinda Himself. Therefore the all-pervasive Brahman is the all-pervasive Govinda.
Bhagavad-gita clearly mentions that the impersonal Brahman is dependent upon
Govinda. That is the real conception of absolute knowledge.

PURPORT
In this verse from Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.6.47), vata-vasanah refers to mendi-
cants who do not care about anything material, including clothing, but who depend
wholly on nature. Such sages do not cover their bodies even in severe winter or
scorching sunshine. They take great pains not to avoid any kind of bodily suffering,
and they live by begging from door to door. They never discharge their semina,
either knowingly or unknowingly. By such celibacy they are able to raise the
semina to the brain. Thus they become most intelligent and develop very sharp
memories. Their minds are never disturbed or diverted from contemplation on the
Absolute Truth, nor are they ever contaminated by desire for material enjoyment.
By practicing austerities under strict discipline, such mendicants attain a neutral
state transcendental to the modes of nature and merge into the impersonal Brahman.

PURPORT
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is by nature joyful. His enjoyments or
pastimes are completely transcendental. He is on the fourth dimension of existence,
for although the material world is measured by the limitations of length, breadth
and height, the Supreme Lord is completely unlimited in His body, form and exis-
tence. He is not personally attached to any of the affairs within the material
cosmos. The material world is created by the expansion of His purusa-avatara, who
directs the aggregate material energy and all the conditioned souls. By understand-
ing the three expansions of the purusa, a living entity can transcend the position
of knowing only the twenty-four elements of the material world.
One of the expansions of Maha-Visnu is Ksirodakasayi Visnu, the Supersoul
within every living entity. As the Supersoul of the total living entities, or the
second purusa, He is known as Garbhodakasayi Vispu. As the creator or original

Adi-Ifla, Chapter 2 105
cause of innumerable universes, or the first purusa, who is lying on the Causal
Ocean, He is called Maha-Visnu. The three purusas direct the affairs of the material
world.

The authorized scriptures direct the individual souls to revive their relationship
with the Supersoul. Indeed, the system of yoga is the process of transcending the
influence of the material elements by establishing a connection with the purusa
known as Paramatma. One who has thoroughly studied the intricacies of creation
can know very easily that this Paramatma is the plenary portion of the Supreme
Being, Sri Krsna.

TRANSLATION

As the one sun appears reflected in countless jewels, so Govinda manifests

Himself [25 Paramatma] in the hearts of all living beings.
PURPORT

The sun is situated in a specific location but is reflected in countless jewels and
appears in innumerable localized aspects. Similarly, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, although eternally present in His transcendental abode Goloka Vrndavana,
is reflected in everyone's heart as the Supersoul. In the Upanigads it is said that the
jiva (living entity) and Paramatma (Supersoul) are like two birds sitting in the same
tree. The Supersoul engages the living being in executing fruitive work as a result of
his deeds in the past, but the Paramatma has nothing to do with such engagements.
As soon as the living being ceases to act in terms of fruitive work and takes to the
service of the Lord (Paramitma), coming to know of His supremacy, he is im-
mediately freed from all designations, and in that pure state he enters the kingdom
of God known as Vaikuntha.

The Supersoul (Paramatma), the guide of the individual living beings, does not
take part in fulfilling the desires of the living beings, but He arranges for their
fulfillment by material nature. As soon as an individual soul becomes conscious of
his eternal relationship with the Supersoul and looks only toward Him, he at once
becomes free from the entanglements of material enjoyment. Christian philosophers


--- Page 108 ---
106 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta
who do not believe in the law of karma put forward the argument that it is absurd
for one to accept the results of past deeds of which he has no consciousness. A
criminal is first reminded of his misdeeds by witnesses in a law court, and then he
is punished. If death is complete forgetfulness, why should a person be punished
for his past misdeeds? The conception of Paramatma is an invincible answer to
these fallacious arguments. The Paramatma is the witness of the past activities of
the individual living being. A man may not remember what he has done in his child-
hood, but his father, who has seen him grow through different stages of develop-
ment, certainly remembers. Similarly, the living being undergoes many changes of
body through many lives, but the Supersoul is also with him and remembers all his
activities, despite his evolution through different bodies.

This verse from Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.9.42) was spoken by Bhismadeva, the
grandfather of the Kurus, when he was lying on a bed of arrows at the last stage of
his life. Arjuna, Krsna and numberless friends, admirers, relatives and sages had
gathered on the scene as Maharaja Yudhisthira took moral and religious instructions
from the dying 81115712. Just as the final moment arrived for him, Bhisma spoke this
verse while looking at Lord Krsna.

Just as the one sun is the object of vision of many different persons, so the one
partial representation of Lord Krsna who lives in the heart of every living entity as
Paramatma is a variously perceived object. One who comes intimately in touch with
Lord Krsna by engaging in His eternal service sees the Supersoul as the localized
partial representation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Bhisma knew the
Supersoul to be a partial expansion of Lord Krsna, whom he understood to be the
supreme unborn transcendental form.

SYNONYMS

seita— that; govinda—Govinda; saksat—personally; caitanya—Lord Caitanya; gosarii
—Gosahi; jiva—the fallen living entities; nistarite—to deliver; aiche—such; dayalu—a
merciful Lord; @ra—another; nai—there is not.

TRANSLATION

That Govinda personally appears as Caitanya Gosafii. No other Lord is as merciful
in delivering the fallen souls.

PURPORT

Having described Govinda in terms of His Brahman and Paramatma features, now
the author of $/7 Caitanya-caritamrta advances his argument to prove that Lord $ri
Caitanya Mahiprabhu is the identical personality. The same Lord त Krsna, in the
garb of a devotee of Sri Krsna, descended to this mortal world to reclaim the fallen
human beings who had misunderstood the Personality of Godhead even after the
explanation of Bhagavad-gita. 11 Bhagavad-gita the Personality of Godhead ঠা
Krsna directly instructed that the Supreme is a person. Impersonal Brahman is His
glowing effulgence, Paramatma is His partial representation, and all men are there-
fore advised to follow the path of Sri Krsna, leaving aside all mundane “isms.”
Offenders misunderstood this instruction, however, because of their poor fund of
knowledge. Thus by His causeless, unlimited mercy $ri Krsna came again as Sri
Caitanya Gosani.

The author of $/7 Caitanya-caritamrta most emphatically stresses that Lord
Caitanya Mahaprabhu is € Krsna Himself. He is not an expansion of the prakdsa or
vilasa forms of ऽन Krsna; He is the svayari-riapa, Govinda. Apart from the relevant
scriptural evidence forwarded by Srila Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami, there are in-
numerable statements regarding Lord Caitanya’s being the Supreme Lord Himself.
The following examples may be cited:

(1) From the Caitanya Upanisad: gaurah sarvatma maha-puruso mahatma maha-
yogr tri-gunatitah sattva-rapo bhaktirh loke kasyati. ‘‘Lord Gaura, who is the all-
pervading Supersoul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, appears as a great saint
and powerful mystic who is above the three modes of nature and is the emblem of
transcendental activity. He disseminates the cult of devotion throughout the world.”

(2) From the Svetasvatara Upanisad:

tam ©Svaraparn paramarih mahesvaram
{0/7 devatanarn paramarh ca daivatam
pati patindri paramarn parastad
vidama devari bhuvane$am igdyam
“‘O Supreme Lord, You are the Supreme Maheévara, the worshipable Deity of all the
demigods and the Supreme Lord of all lords. You are the controller of all controllers,
the Personality of Godhead, the Lord of everything worshipable.” (Svet. Up. 6.7)

—other transcendental literatures; parpa-tattva—full truth; yanre—unto whom; kahe

TRANSLATION

The Personality of Godhead is He who is described as the Absolute Whole in the
Vedas, Bhagavatam, Upanisads and other transcendental literatures. No one is equal
to Him.

PURPORT

There are innumerable authoritative statements in the Vedas regarding the personal
feature of the Absolute Truth. Some of them are as follows:

(1) From the Rk-sarhhita (1.22.20):

tad visnoh paramarn padari
sada pasyanti siirayah
diviva caksuratatam
“The Personality of Godhead Visnu is the Absolute Truth, whose lotus feet all the
demigods are always eager to see. Like the sun-god, He pervades everything by the
rays of His energy. He appears impersonal to imperfect eyes.”

(2) From the Narayanatharva-Sira Upanisad: narayandd eva samutpadyante
narayanat pravartante narayane praliyante. atha nityo nardyanaf. narayana evedarin
sarvam yad bhdtamn yac ca bhavyam. Suddho deva eko narayano na dvitiyo sti
kascit. “It is from Nardyana only that everything is generated, by Him only that
everything is maintained, and in Him only that everything is annihilated. Therefore
Narayana is eternally existing. Everything that exists now or will be created in the
future is nothing but Narayana, who is the unadulterated Deity. There is only
Narayana and nothing else.”

(3) From the Narayana Upanisad: yatah prasata jagatah prasata. ‘Narayana is the
source from whom all the universes emanate.”

(4) From the Hayasirsa-paricaratra: paramatma harir devah. “Hari is the Supreme
Lord.”

(5) From the Bhagavatam (11.3.34-35) :

“O King, know Him who is causeless and yet is the cause of creation, maintenance
and annihilation. He exists in the three states of consciousness—namely waking,
dreaming and deep sleep—as well as beyond them. He enlivens the body, the senses,
the breath of life, and the heart, and thus they move. Know Him to be supreme.”

whose; darsana—sight; s@rya— the sun-god; yena—like; sa-vigraha— with form; dekhe—

TRANSLATION
Through their service, devotees see that Personality of Godhead, just as the
denizens of heaven see the personality of the sun.
PURPORT
The Supreme Personality of Godhead has His ternal form, which cannot be seen
by material eyes or mental speculation. Only by transcendental devotional service
can one understand the transcendental form of the Lord. The comparison is made
here to the qualifications for viewing the personal features of the sun-god. The sun-
god is a person who, although not visible to our eyes, is seen from the higher planets
by the demigods, whose eyes are suitable for seeing through the glaring sunshine
that surrounds him. Every planet has its own atmosphere according to the influence
of the arrangement of material nature. It is therefore necessary to have a particular
type of bodily construction to reach a particular planet. The inhabitants of


--- Page 115 ---
Adi-lila, Chapter 2 113
earth may be able to reach the moon, but the inhabitants of heaven can reach even
the fiery sphere called the sun. What is impossible for man on earth is easy for the
demigods in heaven because of their different bodies. Similarly, to see the Supreme
Lord one must have the spiritual eyes of devotional service. The Personality of
Godhead is unapproachable by those who are habituated to speculation about the
Absolute Truth in terms of experimental scientific thought, without reference to
the transcendental vibration. The ascending approach to the Absolute Truth ends in
the realization of impersonal Brahman and the localized Paramatma but not the
Supreme Transcendental Personality.

PURPORT
This statement, which is from Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.14.14), was spoken by
Lord Brahma in his prayers to Lord Krsna after the Lord defeated him by displaying
His mystic powers. Brahma had tried to test Lord Krsna to see if He were really the
Supreme Personality of Godhead playing as a cowherd boy. Brahma stole all the
other boys and their cows from the pasturing grounds, but when he returned to the
pastures he saw that all the boys and cows were still there, for Lord Krsna had
created them all again. When Brahma saw this mystic power of Lord Krsna, he


--- Page 118 ---
116 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta
admitted defeat and offered prayers to the Lord, addressing Him as the proprietor
and seer of everything in the creation and as the Supersoul who is within each and
every living entity and is dear to all. That Lord Krsna is Narayana, the father of
Brahma, because Lord Kpsna's plenary expansion Garbhodakasayi Visnu, after
placing Himself on the Garbha Ocean, created Brahma from His own body. Maha-
Visnu in the Causal Ocean and Ksirodakasayi Visnu, the Supersoul in everyone's
heart, are also transcendental expansions of the Supreme Truth.

TRANSLATION

“All the living beings within the material and spiritual worlds are ultimately born

of You, for You are the Supersoul of them all.
PURPORT

The cosmic manifestation is generated by the interaction of the three modes of
material nature. The transcendental world has no such material modes, although it
is nevertheless full of spiritual variegatedness. In that spiritual world there are also
innumerable living entities, who are eternally liberated souls engaged in transcen-
dental loving service to Lord Krsna. The conditioned souls who remain within the
material cosmic creation are subjected to the threefold miseries and pangs of
material nature. They exist in different species of life because they are eternally
averse to transcendental loving devotion to the Supreme Lord.

Sankarsana is the original source of all living entities because they are all expan-
sions of His marginal potency. Some of them are conditioned by material nature,
whereas others are under the protection of the spiritual nature. The material nature
is a conditional manifestation of spiritual nature, just as smoke is a conditional stage
of fire. Smoke is dependent on fire, but in a blazing fire there is no place for smoke.
Smoke disturbs, but fire serves. The serving spirit of the residents of the transcen-
dental world is displayed in five varieties of relationships with the Supreme Lord,
who is the central enjoyer. In the material world everyone is a self-centered enjoyer
of mundane happiness and distress. One considers himself the lord of everything and
tries to enjoy the illusory energy, but he is not successful because he is not inde-
pendent; he is but a minute particle of the energy of Lord Sarikarsana. All living
beings exist under the control of the Supreme Lord, who is therefore called
Narayana.

TRANSLATION

‘As the earth is the original cause and shelter of all pots made of earth, so You

are the ultimate cause and shelter of all living beings.
PURPORT

As the vast earth is the source for the ingredients of all earthen pots, so the su-
preme soul is the source for the complete substance of all individual living entities.
The cause of all causes, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the cause of the
living entities. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gitd (7.10), where the Lord says,
bijarh mari sarva-bhatanam (“^| am the seed of all living entities’’), and in the
Upanisads, which say, nityo nityanar cetanas cetananam (‘‘the Lord is the supreme
leader among all the eternal living beings”).

The Lord is the reservoir of all cosmic manifestation, animate and inanimate.
The advocates of viSistadvaita-vada philosophy explain the Vedanta-saitra by
saying that although the living entity has two kinds of bodies—subtle (consisting
of mind, intelligence and false ego) and gross (consisting of the five basic elements)—
and although he thus lives in three bodily dimensions (gross, subtle and spiritual)—
he is nevertheless a spiritual soul. Similarly, the Supreme Personality of Godhead
who emanates the material and spiritual worlds is the Supreme Spirit. As an
individual spirit soul is almost identical to his gross and subtle bodies, so the
Supreme Lord is almost identical to the material and spiritual worlds. The material
world, full of conditioned souls trying to lord it over matter, is a manifestation of
the external energy of the Supreme Lord, and the spiritual world, full of perfect
servitors of the Lord, is a manifestation of His internal energy. Since all living
entities are minute sparks of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He is the
Supreme Soul in both the material and spiritual worlds. The Vaisnavas following
Lord Caitanyastress the doctrine of acintya-bhedabheda-tattva, which states that the
Supreme Lord, being the cause and effect of everything, is inconceivably, simul-
taneously one with His manifestations of energy and different from them.

TRANSLATION
“Since You protect those who are the shelters of all living beings, You are the

PURPORT
The controlling Deities of the living beings in the mundane worlds are the three
purusa-avataras. But the potent energy displayed by Sr Krsna is far more extensive
than that of the purusas. Sri Krsna is therefore the original father and Lord who
protects all creative manifestations through His various plenary portions. Since He
sustains even the shelters of the collective living beings, there is no doubt that Sri
Krsna is the original Narayana.

PURPORT
Sri Krsna, in His Paramatma feature, lives in the hearts of all living beings in both
the transcendental and mundane creations. As Paramatma, He witnesses all actions
the living beings perform in all phases of time, namely past, present and future.
Sri Krsna knows what the living beings have done for hundreds and thousands of
past births, He sees what they are doing now, and therefore He knows the results
of their present actions that will fructify in the future. As stated in Bhagavad-gita,
the entire cosmic situation is created as soon as He glances over the material energy.
Nothing can exist without His superintendence. Since He sees even the abode for
rest of the collective living beings, He is the original Narayana.

TRANSLATION
Superficially we see that these purusas have a relationship with maya, but
above them, in the fourth dimension, is Lord Krsna, who has no contact with the
material energy.
PURPORT
The three purusas—Karanodakasay? Vispu, Garbhodakasayi Visnu and
KsirodakasayT Visnu—all have a relationship with the material energy, called maya,
because through maya They create the material cosmos. These three purusas, who
lie on the Karana, Garbha and Ksira waters, are the Supersoul of everything that
be. Karanodakasayi Visnu is the Supersoul of the collective universes,
Garbhodakasayi Vispu is the Supersoul of the collective living beings, and
Ksirodakasayt Visnu is the Supersoul of all individual living entities. Because all of
Them are somehow attracted to the affairs of the material energy, They can be
said to have some affection for maya. But the transcendental position of Sri Krsna
Himself is not even slightly tinged by maya. His transcendental state is called
turiya, or the fourth-dimensional stage.

PURPORT
The phenomenal manifestation of the supreme whole, the noumenal soul of
everything, and the cause or causal nature are all but designations of the purusas,
who are responsible for material creation. The transcendental position surpasses
these designations and is therefore called the position of the fourth dimension.
This is a quotation from Sridhara Svami’s commentary on the Eleventh Canto,
Fifteenth Chapter, verse 16, of Srimad-Bhagavatam.

TRANSLATION
“This is the opulence of the Lord: Although situated in the material nature, He is
never affected by the modes of nature. Similarly, those who have surrendered to
Him and fixed their intelligence upon Him are not influenced by the modes of
nature.”
PURPORT
This text is from Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.11.38). Those who have taken shelter
of the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead do not identify with the material
world, even while living in it. Pure devotees may deal with the three modes of
material nature, but because of their transcendental intelligence in Krsna conscious-
ness, they are not influenced by the material qualities. The spell of material
activities does not attract such devotees. Therefore, the Supreme Lord and His
devotees acting under Him are always free from material contamination.

TRANSLATION
“You are the ultimate shelter of these three plenary portions. Thus there is not
the slightest doubt that You are the primeval Narayana.
PURPORT
Brahma has confirmed that Lord Krsna is the Supreme, the source of the three
manifestations known as Ksirodakasiyi Vispu, Garbhodakasayi Visnu and
Karanodakasay? Vispu (Maha-Visnu). For His pastimes, Lord Krsna has four
original manifestations—namely, Vasudeva, Sarikarsana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha.
The first purusa-avatara, Maha-Visnu in the Causal Ocean, who is the creator of the
aggregate material energy, is an expansion of Sarikarsana; the second purusa,
Garbhodakasay? Visnu, is an expansion of Pradyumna; and the third purusa,
KsirodakasayT Vispu, is an expansion from Aniruddha. All these are within the
category of manifestations of Narayana, who is a manifestation of Si Krsna.

Paramatma, although all these features are identical.

PURPORT
This statement of Sritnad-Bhagavatam (1.3.28) definitely negates the concept
that Sri Krsna is an avatara of Visnpu or Narayana. Lord Sri Krsna is the original
Personality of Godhead, the supreme cause of all causes. This verse clearly indicates
that incarnations of the Personality of Godhead such 25 $ri Rima, Nysimha and
Varaha all undoubtedly belong to the Visnu group, but all of Them are either
plenary portions or portions of plenary portions of the original Personality of God-
head, Lord < Krsna.

before the known subject because the object has no meaning if the subject is not

PURPORT

S$rimad-Bhdagavatam has listed the avatdras, the plenary expansions of the purusa,
and Lord Krsna appears among them. But the Bhdgavatam further explains Lord
Krsna's specific position as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Since Lord Krsna
is the original Personality of Godhead, reason and argument establish that His
position is always supreme.

Had Krsna been a plenary expansion of Narayana, the original verse would have
been differently composed; indeed, its order would have been reversed. But
there cannot be mistakes, illusion, cheating or imperfect perception in the
words of liberated sages. Therefore there is no mistake in this statement that
Lord Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Sanskrit statements of
Srimad-Bhagavatam are all transcendental sounds. Srila Vyasadeva revealed these
statements after perfect realization, and therefore they are perfect, for liberated
sages like Vyasadeva never commit errors in their rhetorical arrangements. Unless
one accepts this fact, there is no use in trying to obtain help from the revealed
scriptures.

Bhrama refers to false knowledge or mistakes, such as accepting a rope as a snake
or an oyster shell as gold. Pramada refers to inattention or misunderstanding of
reality, and vipra-lipsa is the cheating propensity. Karapapatava refers to imperfect-
ness of the material senses. There are many examples of such imperfection. The
eyes cannot see that which is very distant or very small. One cannot even see his
own eyelid, which is the closest thing to his eye, and if one is disturbed by a disease
like jaundice, he sees everything to be yellow. Similarly, the ears cannot hear distant
sounds. Since the Personality of Godhead and His plenary portions and self-realized
devotees are all transcendentally situated, they cannot be misled by such deficiencies.

PURPORT
The Brahma-samhita, Chapter Five, verse 46, states that the vispu-tattva, or the
principle of the Absolute Personality of Godhead, is like a lamp because the expan-
sions equal their origin in all respects. A burning lamp can light innumerable other
lamps that are not inferior, but still one lamp must be considered the original.
Similarly, the Supreme Personality of Godhead expands Himself in the plenary
forms of the vispu-tattva, but although they are equally powerful, the original
powerful Personality of Godhead is considered the source. This example also explains

fore the power of Lord Siva cannot compare to that of the Visnu principle.”

TRANSLATION

“Here [in Srimad-Bhagavatam] ten subjects are described: (1) the creation of the
ingredients of the cosmos, (2) the creations of Brahma, (3) the maintenance of the
creation, (4) special favor given to the faithful, (5) impetuses for activity, (6) pre-
scribed duties for law-abiding men, (7) a description of the incarnations of the
Lord, (8) the winding up of the creation, (9) liberation from gross and subtle
material existence, and (10) the ultimate shelter, the Supreme Personality of God-
head. The tenth item is the shelter of all the others. To distinguish this ultimate
shelter from the other nine subjects, the mahajanas have described these nine,
directly or indirectly, through prayers or direct explanations."

PURPORT

This verse from Srimad-Bhagavatam (2.10.1) lists the ten subject matters dealt
with in the text of the Bhdgavatam. Of these, the tenth is the substance, and the
other nine are categories derived from the substance. These ten subjects are listed
as follows.

(1) Sarga: the first creation by Visnu, the bringing forth of the five gross material
elements, the five objects of sense perception, the ten senses, the mind, intelligence,
false ego and the total material energy or universal form.

(2) Visarga: the secondary creation, or the work of Brahma in producing the
moving and unmoving bodies in the universe (brahmangda).

(3) Sthdna: the maintenance of the universe by the Personality of Godhead,
Visnu. Visnu's function is more important and His glory greater than Brahma'’s and
Lord Siva’s, for although Brahma is the creator and Lord Siva the destroyer, Visnu
is the maintainer.

(4) Posana: special care and protection for devotees by the Lord. As a king main-
tains his kingdom and subjects but nevertheless gives special attention to the mem-
bers of his family, so the Personality of Godhead gives special care to His devotees
who are souls completely surrendered to Him.

(5) Oti: the urge for creation or initiative power that is the cause of all inventions,
according to the necessities of time, space and objects.


--- Page 148 ---
146 $17 Caitanya-caritamrta

(6) Manvantara: the regulative principles for living beings who desire to achieve
perfection in human life. The rules of Manu, as described in the Manu-sarihita,
guide the way to such perfection.

(7) Tsanukatha: scriptural information regarding the Personality of Godhead, His
incarnations on earth and the activities of His devotees. Scriptures dealing with
these subjects are essential for progressive human life.

(8) Nirodha: the winding up of all energies employed in creation. Such potencies
are emanations from the Personality of Godhead who eternally lies in the Karana
Ocean. The cosmic creations, manifested with His breath, are again dissolved in due
course.

(9) Mukti: liberation of the conditioned souls encaged by the gross and subtle
coverings of body and mind. When freed from all material affection, the soul, giving
up the gross and subtle material bodies, can attain the spiritual sky in his original
spiritual body and engage in transcendental loving service to the Lord in Vaikuntha-
loka or Krsnaloka. When the soul is situated in his original constitutional position
of existence, he is said to be liberated. It is possible to engage in transcendental
loving service to the Lord and become jivan-mukta, a liberated soul, even while in the
material body.

(10) Asraya: the Transcendence, the summum bonum, from whom everything
emanates, upon whom everything rests and in whom everything merges after
annihilation. He is the source and support of all. The a@sraya is also called the
Supreme Brahman, as in the Veddnta-siutra (athato brahma-jijiiasa, janmady asya
yatah). Srimad-Bhagavatam especially describes this Supreme Brahman as the
asraya. Sri Krsna is this dsraya, and therefore the greatest necessity of life is to
study the science of Krsna.

Srimad-Bhagavatam accepts 511 Krsna as the shelter of all manifestations because
Lord Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the ultimate source of every-
thing, the supreme goal of all.

Two different principles are to be considered herein—namely, @raya, the object
providing shelter, and dsrita, the dependents requiring shelter. The asrita exist under
the original principle, the 3$/৫%৫, The first nine categories, described in the first nine
cantos of Srimad-Bhagavatam, from creation to liberation, including the purusa-
avatdras, the incarnations, the marginal energy or living entities, and the external
energy or material world, are all asrita. The prayers of Srimad-Bhagavatam, however,
aim for the asraya-tattva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Krsna. The
great souls expert in describing Srimad-Bhagavatam have very diligently delineated
the other nine categories, sometimes by direct narrations and sometimes by indirect
narrations such as stories. The real purpose of doing this is to know perfectly the
Absolute Transcendence, Sri Krsna, for the entire creation, both material and
spiritual, rests on the body of ऽ Krsna.

exists in four transcendental features: His personality, His impersonal effulgence,
His potential parts and parcels (the living beings), and the principal cause of all
causes. The Supreme Whole is compared to the sun, which also exists in four
features, namely the personality of the sun-god, the glare of his glowing sphere,
the sun rays inside the sun planet, and the sun’s reflections in many other objects.
The ambition to corroborate the existence of the transcendental Absolute Truth
by limited conjectural endeavcrs cannot be fulfilled, because He is beyond the
scope of our limited speculative minds. In an honest search for truth, we must
admit that His powers are inconceivable to our tiny brains. The exploration of

Adi-lila, Chapter 2 149
space has demanded the work of the greatest scientists of the world, yet there are
countless problems regarding even fundamental knowledge of the material creation
that bewilder scientists who confront them. Such material knowledge is far removed
from the spiritual nature, and therefore the acts and arrangements of the Absolute
Truth are, beyond all doubts, inconceivable.

The primary potencies of the Absolute Truth are mentioned to be three: internal,
external and marginal. By the acts of His internal potency, the Personality of
Godhead in His original form exhibits the spiritual cosmic manifestations known
as the eternal Vaikunthalokas, which exist eternally, even after the destruction of
the material cosmic manifestation. By His marginal potency the Lord expands
Himself as living beings who are part of Him, just as the sun distributes its rays in
all directions. By His external potency the Lord manifests the material creation,
just as the sun with its rays creates fog. The material creation is but a perverse
reflection of the eternal Vaikuntha nature.

These three energies of the Absolute Truth are also described in the Visnu Purana,
where it is said that the living being is equal in quality to the internal potency,
whereas the external potency is indirectly controlled by the chief cause of all
causes. Mdya, the illusory energy, misleads a living being as fog misleads a pedestrian
by blocking off the light of the sun. Although the potency of maya is inferior in
quality to the marginal potency, which consists of the living beings, who are part
and parcel of the Lord, it nevertheless has the power to control the living beings,
just as fog can block the actions of a certain portion of the sun’s rays although it
cannot cover the sun. The living beings covered by the illusory energy evolve in
different species of life, with bodies ranging from that of an insignificant ant to
that of Brahma, the constructor of the cosmos. The pradhana, the chief cause of
all causes in the impersonal vision, is none other than the Supreme Lord, whom
one can see face to face in the internal potency. He takes the material all-pervasive
form by His inconceivable power. Although all three potencies—namely, internal,
external and marginal—are essentially one in the ultimate issue, they are different
in action, like electric energy, which can produce both cold and heat under different
conditions. The external and marginal potencies are so called under various condi-
tions, but in the original internal potencies there are no such conditions, nor is it
possible for the conditions of the external potency to exist in the marginal, or vice
versa. One who is able to understand the intricacies of all these energies of the
Supreme Lord can no longer remain an empiric impersonalist under the influence
of a poor fund of knowledge.

TRANSLATION
The Personality of Godhead Sri Krsna enjoys Himself in six primary expansions.
His two manifestations are prabhava and vaibhava.
PURPORT
Now the author of € Caitanya-caritamgta turns to a description of the Per-
sonality of Godhead Krsna in His innumerable expansions. The Lord primarily
expands Himself in two categories, namely prabhava and vaibhava. The prabhava
forms are fully potent like ও Krsna, and the vaibhava forms are partially potent.
The prabhava forms are manifested in relation with potencies, but the vaibhava
forms are manifested in relation with excellences. The potent prdbhava manifesta-
tions are also of two varieties: temporary and eternal. The Mohini, Hamsa and
Sukla forms are manifested only temporarily, in terms of a particular age. Among
the other prabhavas, who are not very famous according to the material estimation,
are Dhanvantari, Rsabha, Vyasa, Dattatreya and Kapila. Among the vaibhava-prakdsa
forms are Kiirma, Matsya, Nara-Narayana, Varaha, Hayagriva, Prsnigarbha, Baladeva,
Yajia, Vibhu, Satyasena, Hari, Vaikuntha, Ajita, Vamana, Sarvabhauma, Rsabha,
Visvaksena, Dharmasetu, Sudhama, Yogesvara and Brhadbhanu.

PURPORT
The vildsa forms are six in number. Incarnations are of two varieties, namely
Saktyavesa (empowered) and arh$avesa (partial). These incarnations also come
within the category of prabhava and vaibhava manifestations. Childhood and boy-
hood are two special features of the Personality of Godhead Sri Krsna, but His
permanent feature is His eternal form as an adolescent youth. The original Per-
sonality of Godhead Sri Kfsna is always worshiped in this eternal adolescent form.

The Personality of Godhead manifests Himself in six different features: (1)
prabhava, (2) vaibhava, (3) empowered incarnations, (4) partial incarnations, (5)
childhood and (6) boyhood. The Personality of Godhead Sri Krsna, whose perma-
nent feature is adolescence, enjoys His transcendental proclivities by performing
pastimes in these six forms. In these six features there are unlimited divisions of the
Personality of 6০0০0176305 forms. The jivas, or living beings, are differentiated parts
and parcels of the Lord. They are all diversities of the one without a second, the
Supreme Personality of Godhead.

PURPORT
The internal potency of the Lord, which is called cit-sakti or antaranga-sakti,
exhibits variegatedness in the transcendental Vaikuptha cosmos. Besides ourselves,
there are unlimited numbers of liberated living beings who associate with the
Personality of Godhead in His innumerable features. The material cosmos displays
the external energy, in which the conditioned living beings are provided all liberty
to go back to the Personality of Godhead after leaving the material tabernacle. The
Svetasvatara Upanisad (6.8) informs us:
na tasya karyarh karanarh ca vidyate

pardsya Saktir vividhaiva Sriyate

“The Supreme Lord is one without a second. He has nothing to do personally, nor
does He have material senses. No one is equal to Him nor greater than Him. He has
unlimited, variegated potencies of different names, which exist within Him as
autonomous attributes and provide Him full knowledge, power and pastimes.”

various names of His plenary expansions because the original Personality of Godhead
includes all such categories. Since the plenary expansions exist within the original
person, one may call Him by any of these names. In the $r7 Caitanya-bhagavata
(Madhya 6.95) Lord Caitanya says, ^^ was lying asleep in the ocean of milk, but |
was awakened by the call of Nida, Sri Advaita Prabhu.” Here the Lord refers to
His form as Ksirodakasayi Visnu.

Prostrating himself at the feet of his readers, the author of Sri Caitanya-caritamrta

TRANSLATION

A sincere student should not neglect the discussion of such conclusions, con-
sidering them controversial, for such discussions strengthen the mind. Thus one’s
mind becomes attached to Sri Krsna.

PURPORT

There are many students who, in spite of reading Bhagavad-gita, misunderstand
Krsna because of imperfect knowledge and conclude Him to be an ordinary historical
personality. This one must not do. One should be particularly careful to under-
stand the truth about Krsna. If because of laziness one does not come to know
Krsna conclusively, one will be misguided about the cult of devotion, like those
who declare themselves advanced devotees and imitate the transcendental symptoms
sometimes observed in liberated souls. Although the use of thoughts and arguments
is a most suitable process for inducing an uninitiated person to become a devotee,
neophytes in devotional service must always alertly understand Krsna through the
vision of the revealed scriptures, the bona fide devotees and the spiritual master.
Unless one hears about Sri Krsna from such authorities, one cannot make advance-
ment in devotion to Sri Krsna. The revealed scriptures mention nine means of
attaining devotional service, of which the first and foremost is hearing from au-
thority. The seed of devotion cannot sprout unless watered by the process of
hearing and chanting. One should submissively receive the transcendental messages
from spiritually advanced sources and chant the very same messages for one’s own
benefit as well as the benefit of one’s audience.

When Brahma described the situation of pure devotees freed from the culture of
empiric philosophy and fruitive actions, he recommended the process of hearing
from persons who are on the path of devotion. Following in the footsteps of such
liberated souls, who are able to vibrate real transcendental sound, can lead one to
the highest stage of devotion, and thus one can become a mahd-bhagavata. From
the teachings of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu to 52212112 Gosvami we learn:

sastra-yuktye sunipuna, drdha-sraddha yanra

‘uttama-adhikart’ sei taraye sarhsara

(Cc. Madhya 22.65)

“A person who is expert in understanding the conclusion of the revealed scriptures
and who fully surrenders to the cause of the Lord is actually able to deliver others
from the clutches of material existence.” $rila ২003 Gosvami, in his Upadesamyta,
advises that to make rapid advancement in the cult of devotional service one should
be very much active and should persevere in executing the duties specified in the


--- Page 163 ---
Adi-Iila, Chapter 2 161
revealed scriptures and confirmed by the spiritual master. Accepting the path of
liberated souls and the association of pure devotees enriches such activities.

Imitation devotees, who wish to advertise themselves as elevated Vaisnavas and
who therefore imitate the previous acdryas but do not follow them in principle, are
condemned in the words of Srimad-Bhagavatam as stone-hearted. 57113 Visvanatha
Cakravarti Thakura has commented on their stone-hearted condition as follows:
bahir asru-pulakayoh sator api yad dhrdayarih na vikriyeta tad a$ma-saram iti
kanisthadhikdrinam “eva a$ru-pulakadi-mattve ‘pi a$ma-sara-hrdayataya nindaisd.
“Those who shed tears by practice but whose hearts have not changed are to be
known as stone-hearted devotees of the lowest grade. Their imitation crying, induced
by artificial practice, is always condemned.” The desired change of heart referred
to above is visible in reluctance to do anything not congenial to the devotional
way. To create such a change of heart, conclusive discussion about ঠা Krsna and
His potencies is absolutely necessary. False devotees may think that simply shedding
tears will lead one to the transcendental plane, even if one has not had a factual
change in heart, but such a practice is useless if there is no transcendental realization.
False devotees, lacking the conclusion of transcendental knowledge, think that
artificially shedding tears will deliver them. Similarly, other false devotees think
that studying books of the previous acaryas is unadvisable, like studying dry empiric
philosophies. But 51712 Jiva Gosvami, following the previous caryas, has inculcated
the conclusions of the scriptures in the six theses called the Sat-sandarbhas. False
devotees who have very little knowledge of such conclusions fail to achieve pure
devotion for want of zeal in accepting the favorable directions for devotional
service given by self-realized devotees. Such false devotees are like impersonalists,
who also consider devotional service no better than ordinary fruitive actions.

In this chapter the author has fully discussed the reason for the descent of Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Sri Krsna, after
displaying His pastimes as Lord Krsna, thought it wise to make His advent in the
form of a devotee to explain personally the transcendental mellow reciprocations of
service and love between Himself and His servants, friends, parents and fiancées.
According to the Vedic literature, the foremost occupational duty for humanity in
this age of Kali is nama-sankirtana, or congregational chanting of the holy name of
the Lord. The incarnation for this age especially preaches this process, but only
Krsna Himself can explain the confidential loving service performed in the four
principal varieties of loving affairs between the Supreme Lord and His devotees.
Lord Krsna therefore personally appeared, with His plenary portions, as Lord
Caitanya. As stated in this chapter, only for that purpose did Lord Krsna appear
personally in Navadvipa in the form of $ri Krsna Caitanya Mahaprabhu.

10050030353 Kavirija has herein presented much authentic evidence from Srimad-
Bhagavatam and other scriptures to substantiate the identity of Lord Caitanya with
Sri Krsna Himself. He has described bodily symptoms in Lord Caitanya that are
visible only in the person of the Supreme Lord, and he has proved that Lord Caitanya
appeared with His personal associates like Si Nityananda, Advaita, Gadadhara,
Srivasa and other devotees to preach the special significance of chanting Hare Krsna.
The appearance of Lord Caitanya is both significant and confidential. He can be ap-
preciated only by pure devotees and only through the process of devotional service.
The Lord tried to conceal His identity as the Supreme Personality of Godhead by
representing Himself as a devotee, but His pure devotees can recognize Him by His
special features. The Vedas and Puranas foretell the appearance of Lord Caitanya,
but still He is sometimes called, significantly, the concealed descent of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead.

Advaita Acarya was a contemporary of Lord Caitanya’s father. He felt sorry for
the condition of the world because even after Lord Krsna's appearance, no one had
interest in devotional service to Krsna. This forgetfulness was so overwhelming that
Advaita Prabhu was convinced that no one but Lord Krsna Himself could enlighten
people about devotional service to the Supreme Lord. Therefore Advaita requested
Lord Krsna to appear 25 Lord Caitanya. Offering tulasi leaves and Ganges water, He
cried for the Lord’s appearance. The Lord, being satisfied by His pure devotees,
descends to satisfy them. As such, being pleased by Advaita Acirya, Lord Caitanya
appeared.

In the previous chapter it has been established that Kysna, the son of Vrajendra
(the King of Vraja), is the Supreme Personality of Godhead with six opulences. He
eternally enjoys transcendentally variegated opulences on His planet, which is known
as Goloka. The eternal pastimes of the Lord in the spiritual planet Kgsnaloka are
called aprakata, or unmanifested pastimes, because they are beyond the purview of
the conditioned souls. Lord Krsna is always present everywhere, but when He is not
present before our eyes, He is said to be aprakata, or unmanifested.

Brahma is of the same duration. These calculations are given in the authentic

great professor of astronomy and mathematics Bimal Prasad Datta, later known as
Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami, who was our merciful spiritual master. He was
honored with the title Siddhanta Sarasvati for writing the Sarya-siddhanta, and the
title Gosvami Maharaja was added when he accepted sannydsa, the renounced order

From the beginning of Brahmas day of 4,320,000,000 years, six Manus appear
and disappear before Lord Krsna appears. Thus 1,975,320,000 years of the day of
Brahma elapse before the appearance of Lord Krsna. This is an astronomical calcu-
lation according to solar years.

jugal love; cari—four; rasa— mellows; cari—four; bhavera—of the sentiments; bhakta—

TRANSLATION

Servitude [५8592], friendship [sakhya], parental affection [vatsalya) and conjugal
love [7६212] are the four transcendental mellows [13535] . By the devotees who
cherish these four mellows, Lord Krsna is subdued.

PURPORT

Dasya, sakhya, vatsalya and $rigdra are the transcendental modes of loving service
to the Lord. $anta-rasa, or the neutral stage, is not mentioned in this verse because
although in $@nta-rasa one considers the Absolute Truth the sublime great, one does
not go beyond that conception. Sdnta-rasa is a very grand idea for materialistic
philosophers, but such idealistic appreciation is only the beginning; it is the lowest
among the relationships in the spiritual world. $anta-rasa is not given much impor-
tancebecause as soon as there is a slight understanding between the knower and the
known, active loving transcendental reciprocations and exchanges begin. Dasya-rasa
is the basic relationship between Krsna and His devotees; therefore this verse considers
dasya the first stage of transcendental devotional service.

TRANSLATION
Absorbed in such transcendental love, Lord $ri Krsna enjoys in Vraja with His
devoted servants, friends, parents and conjugal lovers.
PURPORT
The descent of Sri Krsna, the Absolute Personality of Godhead, is very purposeful.
In Bhagavad-gita it is said that one who knows the truth about इनं Krsna’s descent
and His various activities is at once liberated and does not have to fall again to this
existence of birth and death after he leaves his present material body. In other words,
one who factually understands Krsna makes his life perfect. Imperfect life is realized
in material existence, in five different relationships we share with everyone
within the material world: neutrality, servitorship, friendship, filial love, and amorous
love between husband and wife, or lover and beloved. These five enjoyable relation-
ships within the material world are perverted reflections of relationships with the
Absolute Personality of Godhead in the transcendental nature. That Absolute
Personality, Sri Krsna, descends to revive the five eternally existing relationships.
Thus He manifests His transcendental pastimes in Vraja so that people may be
attracted into that sphere of activities and leave aside their imitation relationships
with the mundane. Then, after fully exhibitingall such activities, the Lord disappears.

TRANSLATION
‘‘Knowing My opulences, the whole world looks upon Me with awe and veneration.
But devotion made feeble by such reverence does not attract Me.
PURPORT
After His appearance, Lord Krsna thought that He had not distributed the tran-
scendental personal dealings with His devotees in dasya, sakhya, vatsalya and
madhurya. One may understand the science of the Supreme Personality of Godhead
from the Vedic literature and thus become a devotee of the Lord and worship Him
within the regulative principles described in the scriptures, but one will not know in
this way how Krsna is served by the residents of Vrajabhiimi. One cannot understand
the dealings of the Lord in Vyndavana simply by executing the ritualistic regulative
principles mentioned in the scriptures. By following scriptural injunctions one may
enhance his appreciation for the glories of the Lord, but there is no chance for one
to enter personal dealings with Him. Giving too much attention to understanding
the exalted glories of the Lord reduces the chance of one’s entering personal loving
affairs with the Lord. To teach the principles of such loving dealings, the Lord
decided to appear as Lord Caitanya.

TRANSLATION
“These liberations are sarsti [achieving opulences equal to those of the Lord],
saripya [having a form the same as the Lord's], simipya [living as a personal
associate of the Lord] and salokya [living on a Vaikuntha planet]. Devotees never
accept sayujya, however, since that is oneness with Brahman.
PURPORT
Those engaged in devotional service according to the ritualistic principles men-
tioned in the scriptures attain these different kinds of liberation. But although such
devotees can attain sdrsti, sartpya, samipya and salokya, they are not concerned
with these liberations, for such devotees are satisfied only in rendering transcen-
dental loving service to the Lord. The fifth kind of liberation, sayujya, is never
accepted even by devotees who perform only ritualistic worship. To attain sdyujya,
or merging into the Brahman effulgence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
is the aspiration of the impersonalists. A devotee never cares for sgyujya liberation.

TRANSLATION
“I shall accept the role of a devotee, and | shall teach devotional service by

PURPORT
When one associates with a pure devotee, he becomes so elevated that he does
not aspire even for sarsti, sarapya, samipya or sdlokya, because he feels that such
liberation is a kind of sense gratification. Pure devotees do not ask anything from
the Lord for their personal benefit. Even if offered personal benefits, pure devotees
do not accept them, because their only desire is to satisfy the Supreme Personality
of Godhead by transcendental loving service. No one but the Lord Himself can
teach this highest form of devotional service. Therefore, when the Lord took the
place of the incarnation of Kali-yuga to spread the glories of chanting Hare Krspa—
the system of worship recommended in this age—He also distributed the process of
devotional service performed on the platform of transcendental spontaneous love.
To teach the highest principles of spiritual life, the Lord Himself appeared as a
devotee in the form of Lord Caitanya.

PURPORT
The prathama-sandhya is the beginning of the age. According to astronomical
calculation, the age is divided into twelve parts. The first of these twelve divisions is
known as the prathama-sandhya. The prathama-sandhya and $esa-sandhya, the last
division of the preceding age, form the junction of the two ages. According to the
Sarya-siddhanta, the prathama-sandhya of the Kali-yuga lasts 36,000 solar years.
Lord Caitanya appeared in the prathama-sandhya after 4,586 solar years of Kali-
yuga had passed.

caitanya—S$ri Krsna Caitanya; $7-krspa— about Lord Krsna; jandye— He taught;

TRANSLATION

In His later pastimes He is known as Lord Sri Krsna Caitanya. He blesses the

whole world by teaching about the name and fame of Lord $ri Krsna.
PURPORT

Lord Caitanya remained a householder only until His twenty-fourth year had
passed. Then He entered the renounced order and remained manifest in this material
world until His forty-eighth year. Therefore Sesa-/ild, or the final portion of His
activities, lasted twenty-four years.

Some so-called Vaisnavas say that the renounced order of life is not accepted in
the Vaisnava sampradaya, or disciplic succession, from Lord Caitanya. This is not a
very intelligent proposition. Sri Caitanya Mahiprabhu took the sannydsa order
from 6110802 Keéava 81121211, who belonged to the Sankara sect, which approves of
only ten names for sannydsis. Long before the advent of Sripada Sarikaracarya,
however, the sannydsa order existed in the Vaispava line of Visnusvami. In the
Visnusvami Vaisnava sampraddya, there are ten different kinds of sannydsa names
and 108 different names for sannydasis who accept the tri-danda, the triple staff of
sannydsa. This is approved by the Vedic rules. Therefore Vaisnava sannyasa was
existent even before the appearance of Sarikaricirya, although those who know
nothing about Vaisnava sannydsa unnecessarily declare that there is no sannydsa in
the Vaisnava sampradaya.

During the time of Lord Caitanya, the influence of Sankaracirya in society was
very strong. People thought that one could accept sannydsa only in the disciplic
succession of Sarkaracarya. Lord Caitanya could have performed His missionary
activities as a householder, but He found householder life an obstruction to His
mission. Therefore He decided to accept the renounced order, sannydsa. Since His
acceptance of sannydsa was also designed to attract public attention, Lord Caitanya,
not wishing to disturb the social convention, took the renounced order of life from
a sannyasi in the disciplic succession of Safkaracarya, although sannydsa was also
sanctioned in the Vaisnava sampradaya.

In the Sarkara-sampradaya there are ten different names awarded to sannydsis:
(1) Tirtha, (2) Aérama, (3) Vana, (4) Aranya, (5) Giri, (6) Parvata, (7) Sagara, (8)
Sarasvati, (9) Bharati and (10) Puri. Before one enters sannydsa, he has one of the
various names for a brahmacari, the assistant to a sannyadsi. Sannydsis with the titles
Tirtha and Aérama generally stay at Dvaraka, and their brahmacdri name is ५५21002.
Those known by the names Vana and Aranya stay at Purusottama, or Jagannitha
Puri, and their brahmacari name is Prakasa. Those with the names Giri, Parvata and


--- Page 185 ---
184 Sri Caitanya-caritaimrta

Sagara generally stay at Badarikasrama, and their brahmacari name is Ananda. Those
with the titles Sarasvati, Bharati and Puri usually live at Srrigeri in South India, and
their brahmacari name is Caitanya.

Sripada Sarkaracarya established four monasteries in India, in the four directions
north, south, east and west, and he entrusted them to four sannyasis who were his
disciples. Now there are hundreds of branch monasteries under these four principal
monasteries, and although there is an official symmetry among them, there are many
differences in their dealings. The four different sects of these monasteries are known
as Anandavara, Bhogavara, Kitavara and BhGimivara, and in course of time they have
developed different ideas and different slogans.

According to the regulation of the disciplic succession, one who wishes to enter
the renounced order in 621८2125 sect must first be trained as a brahmacari under a
bona fide sannyasi. The brahmacari’s name is ascertained according to the group to
which the sannydsi belongs. Lord Caitanya accepted sannydsa from Kesava Bharati.
When He first approached Kesava 8112121}, He was accepted as a brahmacarf, with the
name 511 Krsna Caitanya Brahmacari. After He took sannydsa, He preferred to keep
the name Krsna Caitanya.

The great authorities in the disciplic succession had not offered to explain why
Lord Caitanya refused to take the name Bharati after He took sannydsa from a
Bharati, until Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami Maharaja volunteered the
explanation that because a sannyasi in the Safnkara-sampradaya thinks that he has
become the Supreme, Lord Caitanya, wanting to avoid such a misconception, kept
the name Sri Krsna Caitanya, placing Himself as an eternal servitor. A brahmacari is
supposed to serve the spiritual master; therefore He did not negate that relationship
of servitude to His spiritual master. Accepting such a position is favorable for the
relationship between the disciple and the spiritual master.

The authentic biographies also mention that Lord Caitanya accepted the 00090
(rod) and begging pot, symbolic of the sannyasa order, at the time He took
sannyasa.

namera—of the holy name; pracara— propagation; tathi—this; lagi’—for; pita-varpa—

TRANSLATION
The religious practice for the age of Kali is to broadcast the glories of the holy
name. Only for this purpose has the Lord, in a yellow color, descended as Lord
Caitanya.
PURPORT
In this age of Kali the practical system of religion for everyone is the chanting of
the name of Godhead. This was introduced in this age by Lord Caitanya. Bhakti-
yoga actually begins with the chanting of the holy name, as confirmed by
Madhvacarya in his commentary on the Munpdaka Upanisad. He quotes this verse
from the Nardyanpa-sarihita:
dvdpariyair janair vispuh paficaratrais tu kevalaih
kalau tu nama-matrena pdjyate bhagavan harip
“In the Dvapara-yuga people should worship Lord Visnu only by the regulative
principles of the Ndrada-paficardtra and other such authorized books. In the age of
Kali, however, people should simply chant the holy names of the Supreme Person-
ality of Godhead.” The Hare Krsna mantra is specifically mentioned in many
Upanisads, such as the Kali-santarana Upanisad, where it is said:
hare krsna hare krsna krsna krspa hare hare
hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare
iti sodasakarih namnarn kali-kalmasa-nasanam
natah parataropayah sarva-vedesu drsyate
“After searching through all the Vedic literature one cannot find a method of
religion more sublime for this age than the chanting of Hare Krsna.”

TRANSLATION

“In His early pastimes He appears as a householder with a golden complexion. His
limbs are beautiful, and His body, smeared with the pulp of sandalwood, seems like
molten gold. In His later pastimes He accepts the sannyasa order, and He is equi-
poised and peaceful. He is the highest abode of peace and devotion, for He silences
the impersonalist nondevotees."”

PURPORT

This is a verse from the Mahabharata (Dana-dharma, Vispu-sahasra-
nama-stotra). In his commentary on the Visnu-sahasra-nama called the
Namartha-sudhabhidha, 51113 Baladeva VidyibhUsana, commenting upon
this verse, asserts that Lord Caitanya is the Supreme Personality of
Godhead according to the evidence of the Upanisads. He explains that suvarpa-
varnah means a golden complexion. He also quotes the Vedic injunction yada pasyah
pasyate rukma-varparih kartdram 4/7 purusarn brahma-yonim. Rukma-varpari
kartaram isam refers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead as having a complexion
the color of molten gold. Purusam means the Supreme Lord, and brahma-yonim
indicates that He is also the Supreme Brahman. This evidence, too, proves that Lord
Caitanya is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krsna. Another meaning of the
description of the Lord as having a golden hue is that Lord Caitanya’s personality is
as fascinating as gold is attractive. Srila Baladeva Vidyabhiisana has explained that
the word vararnga means “exquisitely beautiful.”

Lord Caitanya accepted sannydsa, leaving aside His householder life, to preach
His mission. He has equanimity in different senses. First, He describes the confi-
dential truth of the Personality of Godhead, and second, He satisfies everyone by
knowledge and attachment to Krsna. He is peaceful because He renounces all topics
not related to the service of Krsna. Srila Baladeva Vidyabhisana has explained that


--- Page 193 ---
192 Sri Caitanya-caritimrta
the word nisthd indicates His being rigidly fixed in chanting the holy name of Si
Krsna. Lord Caitanya subdued all disturbing opponents of devotional service,
especially the monists, who are actually averse to the personal feature of the
Supreme Lord.

SYNONYMS

krsna-varnam—repeating the syllables krs-ia; tvisa—with a luster; akrsnam—not
black (golden); sa-afiga—along with associates; updriga—servitors; astra—weapons;
padrsadam—confidential companions; yajAiaih—by sacrifice; sankirtana-prayaih—
consisting chiefly of congregational chanting; yajanti—they worship; hi—certainly;
su-medhasah —intelligent persons.

TRANSLATION

“In the age of Kali, intelligent persons perform congregational chanting to wor-
ship the incarnation of Godhead who constantly sings the name of Krsna. Although
His complexion is not blackish, He is Krsna Himself. He is accompanied by His
associates, servants, weapons and confidential companions.”

PURPORT

This text is from Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.5.32). Srila Jiva Gosvami has explained
this verse in his commentary on the Bhagavatam known as the Krama-sandarbha,
wherein he says that Lord (< {९12 also appears with a golden complexion. That
golden Lord Krsna is Lord Caitanya, who is worshiped by intelligent men in this
age. That is confirmed in Srimad-Bhagavatam by Gargamuni, who said that although
the child ।< {502 was blackish, He also appears in three other colors—red, white and
yellow. He exhibited His white and red complexions in the Satya and Treta ages
respectively. He did not exhibit the remaining color, yellow-gold, until He appeared
as Lord Caitanya, who is known as Gaurahari.

Srila Jiva Gosvami explains that krsna-varnam means € Krsna Caitanya. Krsna-
varna and Kgsna Caitanya are equivalent. The name Kysna appears with both Lord
Krsna and Lord Caitanya Krsna. Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, but He always engages in describing Krsna and thus
enjoying transcendental bliss by chanting and remembering His name and form.
Lord Krsna Himself appears as Lord Caitanya to preach the highest gospel.


--- Page 195 ---
194 Sri Caitanya-caritaimrta

Varpayati means “utters” or “describes.” Lord Caitanya always chants the holy
name of Krsna and describes it also, and because He is Krsna Himself, whoever
meets Him will automatically chant the holy name of Krsna and later describe it to
others. He injects one with transcendental Krsna consciousness, which merges the
chanter in transcendental bliss. In all respects, therefore, He appears before every-
one as Krsna, either by personality or by sound. Simply by seeing Lord Caitanya
one at once remembers Lord Krsna. One may therefore accept Him as visnu-tattva.
In other words, Lord Caitanya is Lord Krsna Himself.

Sangopangastra-parsadam further indicates that Lord Caitanya is Lord Krsna.
His body is always decorated with ornaments of sandalwood and with sandalwood
paste. By His superexcellent beauty He subdues all the people of the age. In other
descents the Lord sometimes used weapons to defeat the demoniac, but in this age
the Lord subdues them with His all-attractive figure as Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Srila
Jiva Gosvami explains that His beauty is His astra, or weapon, to subdue the
demons. Because He is all-attractive, it is to be understood that all the demigods
lived with Him as His companions. His acts were uncommon and His associates
wonderful. When He propagated the sarikirtana movement, He attracted many great
scholars and dcaryas, especially in Bengal and Orissa. Lord Caitanya is always
accompanied by His best associates like Lord Nityananda, Advaita, Gadadhara and
Srivasa.

Srila Jiva Gosvami cites a verse from the Vedic literature which says that there
is no necessity of performing sacrificial demonstrations or ceremonial functions.
He comments that instead of engaging in such external, pompous exhibitions, all
people, regardless of caste, color or creed, can assemble together and chant Hare
Krsna to worship Lord Caitanya. Krspa-varparh tvisakrspam indicates that promi-
nence should be given to the name of Krsna. Lord Caitanya taught Krsna con-
sciousness and chanted the name of Krsna. Therefore, to worship Lord Caitanya,
everyone should together chant the maha-mantra—Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna
Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. To propagate
worship in churches, temples or mosques is not possible, because people have lost
interest in that. But anywhere and everywhere, people can chant Hare Krsna. Thus
worshiping Lord Caitanya, they can perform the highest activity and fulfill the
highest religious purpose of satisfying the Supreme Lord.

Srila Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya, a famous disciple of Lord Caitanya, said: “The
principle of transcendental devotional service having been lost, Sri Krsna Caitanya
has appeared to deliver again the process of devotion. He is so kind that He is
distributing love of Krsna. Everyone should be attracted more and more to His
lotus feet, as humming bees are attracted to a lotus flower.”

‘anga’-$abde arhsa kahe, seho satya haya
maya-karya nahe—saba cid-inanda-maya
SYNONYMS
anga-sabde—by the word ariga; arh$a—plenary portion; kahe—one means; seho—
that; satya—the truth; haya—is; mayd—of the material energy; kdrya—the work;
nahe—is not; saba—all; cit-ananda-maya—full of knowledge and bliss.
TRANSLATION
The word “anga” indeed refers to plenary portions. Such manifestations should
never be considered products of material nature, for they are all transcendental, full
of knowledge and full of bliss.
PURPORT
In the material world, if a fragment is taken from an original object, the original
object is reduced by the removal of that fragment. But the Supreme Personality of
Godhead is not at all affected by the actions of mdya. The I$opanisad says:
orh parnam adah parpam idarh
parnat parpnam udacyate


--- Page 205 ---
204 Sri Caitanya-caritim rta
parnasya ptrnam adaya
puarpam evavasisyate
“The Personality of Godhead is perfect and complete, and because He is completely
perfect, all emanations from Him, such as this phenomenal world, are perfectly
equipped as complete wholes. Whatever is produced of the complete whole is also
complete in itself. Because He is the complete whole, even though so many
complete units emanate from Him, He remains the complete balance.” (67
Isopanisad, Invocation)

In the realm of the Absolute, one plus one equals one, and one minus one equals
one. Therefore one should not conceive of a fragment of the Supreme Lord in the
material sense. In the spiritual world there is no influence of the material energy or
material calculations of fragments. In the Fifteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gita the
Lord says that the living entities are His parts and parcels. There are innumerable
living entities throughout the material and spiritual universes, but still Lord Krsna
is full in Himself. To think that God has lost His personality because His many
parts and parcels are distributed all over the universe is an illusion. That is a material
calculation. Such calculations are possible only under the influence of the material
energy, mdyd. In the spiritual world the material energy is conspicuous only by its
absence.

In the category of visnu-tattva there is no loss of power from one expansion to
the next, any more than there is a loss of illumination as one candle kindles another.
Thousands may be kindled by an original candle, and all will have the same candle
power. In this way it is to be understood that although all the vispu-tattvas, from
Krsna and Lord Caitanya to Rama, Ngsimha, Varaha and so on, appear with
different features in different ages, all are equally invested with supreme potency.

Demigods such as Lord Brahma and Lord Siva come in contact with the material
energy, and their power and potency are therefore of different gradations. All the
incarnations of Visnu, however, are equal in potency, for the influence of mdyad
cannot even approach them.

Sri Advaita Prabhu and Sri Nityananda Prabhu are both plenary portions of Lord
Caitanya. Thus They are the limbs [21825] of His body. The parts of these two
limbs are called the upangas.

sahite—along with Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu; se/—these; saba—all;astra— weapons;
haya—are; pasapnda—the atheists; dalite—to trample.

TRANSLATION

Thus the Lord is equipped with sharp weapons in the forms of His parts and
plenary portions. All these weapons are competent enough to crush the faithless
atheists.

PURPORT

The word pdsanda is very significant here. One who compares the Supreme
Personality of Godhead to the demigods is known as a pdsanda. Pdsandas try to
bring the Supreme Lord down to a mundane level. Sometimes they create their
own imaginary God or accept an ordinary person as God and advertise him as equal
to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They are so foolish that they present
someone as the next incarnation of Lord Caitanya or Krsna although His activities
are all contradictory to those of a genuine incarnation, and thus they fool the
innocent public. One who is intelligent and who studies the characteristics of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead with reference to the Vedic context cannot be
bewildered by the pdsandas.

Pdsangdas, or atheists, cannot understand the pastimes of the Supreme Lord or
transcendental loving service to the Lord. They think that devotional service is no
better than ordinary fruitive activities (karma). As Bhagavad-gita (4.8) confirms,
however, the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His devotees, saving the righteous
and chastising the miscreants (paritrandya sadhiinari vindsdya ca duskrtam), always
curb these nonsensical atheists. Miscreants always want to deny the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead and put stumbling blocks in the path of devotional service.
The Lord sends His bona fide representatives and appears Himself to curb this
nonsense.

Such a person is truly intelligent, whereas others, who have but a poor fund of

performances, the chanting of the Lord's holy name is the most sublime.
PURPORT
Lord ७7 Caitanya Mahaprabhu is the father and inaugurator of the sankirtana
movement. One who worships Him by sacrificing his life, money, intelligence and
words for the sankirtana movement is recognized by the Lord and endowed with
His blessings. All others may be said to be foolish, for of all sacrifices in which a
man may apply his energy, a sacrifice made for the sarkirtana movement is the
most glorious.

TRANSLATION
One who says that ten million a§vamedha sacrifices are equal to the chanting of
the holy name of Lord Krsna is undoubtedly an atheist. He is sure to be punished
by Yamaraja.
PURPORT
In the list of the ten kinds of offenses in chanting the holy name of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Hare Krsna, the eighth offense is dharma-vrata-tyaga-
hutadi-sarva-$Subha-kriya-samyam api pramadah. One should never consider the
chanting of the holy name of Godhead equal to pious activities like giving charity
to brahmanas or saintly persons, opening charitable educational institutions, dis-
tributing free foodstuffs and so on. The results of pious activities do not equal the
results of chanting the holy name of Krsna.
The Vedic scriptures say:
go-koti-danari grahape khagasya
prayaga-gangodaka-kalpa-vasah
yajfidyutarn meru-suvarna-danam
govinda-kirter na samarn Satarnsaif


--- Page 210 ---
Adi-Iila, Chapter 3 209
“Even if one distributes ten million cows in charity during an eclipse of the sun,
lives at the confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna for millions of years, or gives a
mountain of gold in sacrifice to the brahmanas, he does not earn one hundredth
part of the merit derived from chanting Hare Krsna.” In other words, one who
accepts the chanting of Hare Krsna to be some kind of pious activity is completely
misled. Of course, it is pious; but the real fact is that Krsna and His name, being
transcendental, are far above all mundane pious activity. Pious activity is on the
material platform, but chanting of the holy name of Krsna is completely on the
spiritual plane. Therefore, although pdsandis do not understand this, pious activity
can never compare to the chanting of the holy name.

TRANSLATION

“I take shelter of Lord $ri Krsna Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who is outwardly of a fair
complexion but is inwardly Krsna Himself. In this age of Kali He displays His
expansions [ His 27825 and ५027825] by performing congregational chanting of the
holy name of the Lord.”

PURPORT

Srila Jiva Gosvami has placed the verse from Srimad-Bhagavatam quoted in
text 52 (krspa-varparh tvisakrspam. . ~) as the auspicious introduction to his
Bhagavata-sandarbha or Sat-sandarbha. He has composed this text (81), which is, in
effect, an explanation of the Bhagavatam verse, as the second verse of the same
work. The verse from Srimad-Bhagavatam was enunciated by Karabhajana, one of
the nine great sages, and it is elaborately explained by the Sarva-sarhvadini, Jiva
Gosvami’s commentary on his own Sat-sandarbha.

Antah krsna refers to one who is always thinking of Krsna. This attitude is a
predominent feature of S$rimati Radharani. Even though many devotees always
think of Krsna, none can surpass the gopis, among whom Radharani is the leader
in thinking of Krsna. Radharani’s Krsna consciousness surpasses that of all other
devotees. Lord Caitanya accepted the position of Srimati Radharan to understand
Krsna; therefore He was always thinking of Krspain the same way 25 Radharani.
By thinking of Lord Krsna, He always overlapped Krsna.

Sri Krsna Caitanya, who was outwardly very fair, with a complexion like molten
gold, simultaneously manifested His eternal associates, opulences, expansions and
incarnations. He preached the process of chanting Hare Krsna, and those who are
under His lotus feet are glorious.

TRANSLATION

““O my Lord, those influenced by demoniac principles cannot realize You, although
You are clearly the Supreme by dint of Your exalted activities, forms, character
and uncommon power, which are confirmed by all the revealed scriptures in the
quality of goodness and the celebrated transcendentalists in the divine nature.”

PURPORT

This is a verse from the Stotra-ratna (12) of Yamunacarya, the spiritual master of
Ramanujacarya. The authentic scriptures describe the transcendental activities,
features, form and qualities of Krsna, and Krsna explains Himself in Bhagavad-gita,
the most authentic scripture in the world. He is further explained in $rimad-
Bhagavatam, which is considered the explanation of Vedanta-siatra. Lord Krsna is
accepted as the Supreme Personality of Godhead by these authentic scriptures, not
simply by vox populi. In the modern age a certain class of fools think that they can
vote anyone into the position of God, as they can vote a man into the position of a
political executive head. But the transcendental Supreme Personality of Godhead is
perfectly described in the authentic scriptures. In Bhagavad-gita the Lord says that
only fools deride Him, thinking that anyone can speak like Krsna.

Even according to historical references, Krsna’s activities are most uncommon.
Krsna has affirmed, “I am God,” and He has acted accordingly. Mayavadis think
that everyone can claim to be God, but that is their illusion, for no one else can
perform such extraordinary activities as Krsna. ‘When He was a child on the lap of
His mother, He killed the demon Patana. Then He killed the demons Trpavarta,
Vatsasura and Baka. When He was a little more grown up, He killed the demons
Aghasura and Rsabhasura. Therefore God is God from the very beginning. The idea
that someone can become God by meditation is ridiculous. By hard endeavor one
may realize his godly nature, but he will never become God. The asuras, or demons,
who think that anyone can become God, are condemned.

The authentic scriptures are compiled by personalities like Vyasadeva, Narada,
Asita and Parasara, who are not ordinary men. All the followers of the Vedic way
of life have accepted these famous personalities, whose authentic scriptures conform
to the Vedic literature. Nevertheless, the demoniac do not believe their statements,
and they purposely oppose the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His devotees.
Today it is fashionable for common men to write whimsical words as so-called
incarnations of God and be accepted as authentic by other common men. This
demoniac mentality iscondemned in the Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-gita, wherein
itis said that those who are miscreants and the lowest of mankind, who are fools and
asses, cannot accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead because of their demoniac
nature. They are compared to w/Gkas, or owls, who cannot open their eyes in the

sunlight. Because they cannot bear sunlight, they hide themselves from it and never
see it. They cannot believe that there is such illumination.

always transcendental to such limitations. You sometimes cover such characteristics
by Your own energy, but nevertheless Your unalloyed devotees are always able to
see You under all circumstances.”

PURPORT

This verse is also quoted from the Stotra-ratna (13) of Yamunacarya. Everything
covered by the influence of maya is within the limited boundaries of space, time
and thought. Even the greatest manifestation we can conceive, the sky, also has
limitations. From the authentic scriptures, however, it is evident that beyond the
sky is a covering of seven layers, each ten times thicker than the one preceding it.
The covering layers are vast, but with or without coverings, space is limited. Our
power to think about space and time is also limited. Time is eternal; we may imagine
billions and trillions of years, but that will still be an inadequate estimate of the
extent of time. Our imperfect senses, therefore, cannot think of the greatness of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, nor can we bring Him within the limitations
of time or our thinking power. His position is accordingly described by the word
ullanghita. He is transcendental to space, time and thought; although He appears
within them, He exists transcendentally. Even when the Lord’s transcendental
existence is disguised by space, time and thought, however, pure devotees of the
Supreme Lord can see Him in His personal features beyond space, time and thought.
In other words, even though the Lord is not visible to the eyes of ordinary men,
those who are beyond the covering layers because of their transcendental devotional
service can still see Him.

The sun may appear covered by a cloud, but actually it is the eyes of the tiny
people below the cloud that are covered, not the sun. If those tiny people rose
above the cloud in an airplane, they could then see the sunshine and the sun without
impediment. Similarly, although the covering of maya is very strong, Lord Krsna
says in Bhagavad-gita:

daivi hy esa 4८/14/7147
mama maya duratyaya
mam eva ye prapadyante

mayam etarn taranti te
“This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is
difficult to overcome. But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross
beyond it.” (Bg. 7.14) To surpass the influence of the illusory energy is very difficult,
but those who are determined to catch hold of the lotus feet of the Lord are freed
from the clutches of maya. Therefore, pure devotees can understand the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, but demons, because of their miscreant behavior, cannot
understand the Lord, in spite of seeing the many revealed scriptures and the
uncommon activities of the Lord.

SYNONYMS
dvau—two; bhita—of the living beings; sargau—dispositions; foke—in the world;
asmin—in this; daivah—godly; dsurah—demoniac; eva—certainly; ca—and; visnu-
bhaktah—a devotee of Lord Visnu; smrtah—remembered; daivah—godly; asurah—
demoniac; tat-viparyayah—the opposite of that.
TRANSLATION
“There are two classes of men in the created world. One consists of the demoniac
and the other of the godly. The devotees of Lord Visnu are the godly, whereas those
who are just the opposite are called demons.”
PURPORT
This is a verse from the Padma Purdpa. Vispu-bhaktas, or devotees in Krsna
consciousness, are known as devas (demigods). Atheists, who do not believe in
God or who declare themselves God, are asuras (demons). Asuras always engage in


--- Page 218 ---
Adi-lila, Chapter 3 217
atheistic material activities, exploring ways to utilize the resources of matter to
enjoy sense gratification. The vispu-bhaktas, Krsna conscious devotees, are also
active, but their objective is to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead by devo-
tional service. Superficially both classes may appear to work in the same way, but
their purposes are completely opposite because of a difference in consciousness.
Asuras work for personal sense gratification, whereas devotees work for the satis-
faction of the Supreme Lord. Both work conscientiously, but their motives are
different.

The Krsna consciousness movement is meant for devas, or devotees. Demons
cannot take part in Krsna conscious activities, nor can devotees in Krsna conscious-
ness take part in demoniac activities or work like cats and dogs simply for sense
gratification. Such activity does not appeal to those in Krsna consciousness. Devotees
accept only the bare necessities of life to keep themselves fit to act in Krsna con-
sciousness. The balance of their energy is used for developing Krsna consciousness,
through which one can be transferred to the abode of Krsna by always thinking of
Him, even at the point of death.

Whenever the Supreme Personality of Godhead descends in His human form, He
sends ahead all His devotees, who act as His father, teacher and associates in many
roles. Such personalities appear before the descent of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Before the appearance of Lord Sri Krsna Caitanya Mahaprabhu, there
appeared His devotees like Sri Madhavendra Puri; His spiritual master, SiT Tsvara
Puri; His mother, Srimati Sacidevi; His father, Sri Jagannatha Miéra; and Sri Advaita

TRANSLATION
Everyone was engaged in material enjoyment, whether sinfully or virtuously.
No one was interested in the transcendental service of the Lord, which can give
total relief from the repetition of birth and death.
PURPORT
Advaita Acarya saw the entire world to be engaged in activities of material piety
and impiety, without a trace of devotional service or Krsna consciousness anywhere.
The fact is that in this material world there is no scarcity of anything except Krsna
consciousness. Material necessities are supplied by the mercy of the Supreme Lord.
We sometimes feel scarcity because of our mismanagement, but the real problem is
that people are out of touch with Krsna consciousness. Everyone is engaged in
material sense gratification, but people have no plan for making an ultimate solution
to their real problems, namely, birth, disease, old age and death. These four material
miseries are called bhava-roga, or material diseases. They can be cured only by Krsna
consciousness. Therefore Krsna consciousness is the greatest benediction for
human society.

TRANSLATION
Seeing the activities of the world, the Acirya felt compassion and began to pon-
der how he could act for the people’s benefit.
PURPORT
This sort of serious interest in the welfare of the public makes one a bona fide
dcarya. An dcarya does not exploit his followers. Since the gcarya is a confidential
servitor of the Lord, his heart is always full of compassion for humanity in its
suffering. He knows that all suffering is due to the absence of devotional service to
the Lord, and therefore he always tries to find ways to change people’s activities,
making them favorable for the attainment of devotion. That is the qualification of


--- Page 222 ---
Adi-llla, Chapter 3 221
an dcdrya. Although Sri Advaita Prabhu Himself was powerful enough to do the
work, as a submissive servitor He thought that without the personal appearance of
the Lord, no one could improve the fallen condition of society. In the grim clutches
of maya, the first-class prisoners of this material world wrongly think themselves
happy because they are rich, powerful, resourceful and so on. These foolish creatures
do not know that they are nothing but play dolls in the hands of material nature
and that at any moment material nature's pitiless intrigues can crush to dust all
their plans for godless activities. Such foolish prisoners cannot see that however
they improve their position by artificial means, the calamities of repeated birth,
death, disease and old age are always beyond the jurisdiction of their control.
Foolish as they are, they neglect these major problems of life and busy themselves
with false things that cannot help them solve their real problems. They know that
they do not want to suffer death or the pangs of disease and old age, but under the
influence of the illusory energy, they are grossly negligent and therefore do nothing
to solve the problems. This is called mdya. People held in the grip of mdya are
thrown into oblivion after death, and as a result of their karma, in the next life they
become dogs or gods, although most of them become dogs. To become gods in the
next life, they must engage in the devotional service of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead; otherwise, they are sure to become dogs or hogs in terms of the laws of
nature.

The third-class prisoners, being less materially opulent than the first-class
prisoners, endeavor to imitate them, for they also have no information of the real
nature of their imprisonment. Thus they also are misled by the illusory material
nature. The function of the dcarya, however, is to change the activities of both the
first-class and third-class prisoners for their real benefit. This endeavor makes him
a very dear devotee of the Lord, who says clearly in Bhagavad-gita that no one in
human society is dearer to Him than a devotee who constantly engages in His
service by finding ways to preach the message of Godhead for the real benefit of
the world. The so-called acaryas of the age of Kali are more concerned with ex-
ploiting the resources of their followers than mitigating their miseries; but Sri
Advaita Prabhu, as an ideal acarya, was concerned with improving the condition
of the world situation.

TRANSLATION

“My name, ‘Advaita,’ will be fitting if 1 am able to induce Krsna to inaugurate

the movement of the chanting of the holy name.”
PURPORT

The nondualist Mayavadi philosopher who falsely believes that he is nondifferent
from the Lord is unable to call Him like Advaita Prabhu. Advaita Prabhu is non-
different from the Lord, yet in His relationship with the Lord He does not merge
in Him but eternally renders service unto Him as a plenary portion. This is incon-
ceivable for Mayavadis because they think in terms of mundane sense perception
and therefore think that nondualism necessitates losing one's separate identity. It is
clear from this verse, however, that Advaita Prabhu, although retaining His separate
identity, is nondifferent from the Lord.

Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu preached the philosophy of inconceivable, simultaneous
oneness with the Lord and difference from Him. Conceivable dualism and monism
are conceptions of the imperfect senses, which are unable to reach the Transcendence
because the Transcendenceis beyond the conception of limited potency. The actions
of Sri Advaita Prabhu, however, give tangible proof of inconceivable nondualism.
One who therefore surrenders unto Sri Advaita Prabhu can easily follow the
philosophy of inconceivable simultaneous dualism and monism.

Advaita Acarya considered the meaning of the verse in this way: Not finding any
way to repay the debt He owes to one who offers Him a tulasi leaf and water, Lord
Krsna thinks, “There is no wealth in My possession that is equal to a tulasi leaf and
water.”

Thus the Lord liquidates the debt by offering His own self to the devotee. Con-

PURPORT

Through devotional service one can easily please Lord Krsna with a leaf of the
tulasi plant and a little water. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (9.26), a leaf, a
flower, a fruit or some water (patrari puspari phalari toyam), when offered with
devotion, very much pleases Him. He universally accepts the services of His devotees.
Even the poorest of devotees in any part of the world can secure a small flower,
fruit or leaf and a little water, and if these offerings, and especially tulasi leaves and
Ganges water, are offered to Krsna with devotion, He is very satisfied. It is said that
Krsna is so pleased by such devotional service that He offers Himself to His devotee
in exchange for it. Srila Advaita Acirya knew this fact, and therefore He decided to
call for the Personality of Godhead ।< [९113 to descend by worshiping the Lord with
tulasi leaves and the water of the Ganges.

PURPORT

This text from S$rimad-Bhagavatam (3.9.11) is a prayer by Lord Brahma to the
Supreme Personality of Godhead Krsna for His blessings in the work of creation.
Knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be understood from the
descriptions of the Vedic scriptures. For example, the Brahma-sarhhita describes
that in the abode of Lord Krsna, which is made of cintamani (touchstone), the Lord,
acting as a cowherd boy, is served by hundreds and thousands of goddesses of
fortune. Mayavadis think that the devotees have imagined the form of Krsna, but
the authentic Vedic scriptures have actually described Krsna and His various tran-
scendental forms.

The word $ruta in Sruteksita-pathah refers to the Vedas, and iksita indicates that
the way to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead is by proper study of
the Vedic scriptures. One cannot imagine something about God or His form. Such
imagination is not accepted by those who are serious about enlightenment. Here
Brahma says that one can know Krsna through the path of properly understanding
the Vedic texts. If by studying the form, name, qualities, pastimes and paraphernalia


--- Page 229 ---
228 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta

of the Supreme Godhead one is attracted to the Lord, he can execute devotional
service, and the form of the Lord will be impressed in his heart and remain tran-
scendentally situated there. Unless a devotee actually develops transcendental love
for the Lord, it is not possible for him to think always of the Lord within his heart.
Such constant thought of the Lord is the sublime perfection of the yogic process, as
Bhagavad-gitd confirms in the Sixth Chapter, stating that anyone absorbed in such
thought is the best of all yogis. Such transcendental absorption is known as samadhi.
A pure devotee who is always thinking of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is
the person qualified to see the Lord.

One cannot speak of Urugaya (the Lord, who is glorified by sublime prayers)
unless one is transcendentally elevated. The Lord has innumerable forms, as the
Brahma-sarhhita confirms (advaitam acyutam anddim ananta-ripam). The Lord
expands Himself in innumerable svarisa forms. When a devotee, hearing about these
innumerable forms, becomes attached to one and always thinks of Him, the Lord
appears to him in that form. Lord Krsna is especially pleasing to devotees for whom
He is always present in the heart because of their highly elevated transcendental
love.

--- Page 231 ---
477৫

In this chapter of the epic Caitanya-caritamrta, Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami has
stressed that Lord Caitanya appeared for three principal purposes of His own. The
first purpose was to relish the position of Srimati Radharani, who is the prime
reciprocator of transcendental love of Sri Krsna. Lord Krsna is the reservoir of
transcendental loving transactions with Srimati ९३013137. The subject of those
loving transactions is the Lord Himself, and Radharani is the object. Thus the
subject, the Lord, wanted to relish the loving mellow in the position of the object,
Radharani.

The second reason for His appearance was to understand the transcendental
mellow of Himself. Lord Krsna is all sweetness. Radharani’s attraction for Krsna is
sublime, and to experience that attraction and understand the transcendental sweet-
ness of Himself, He accepted the mentality of Radharani.

The third reason that Lord Caitanya appeared was to enjoy the bliss tasted by
Radharani. The Lord thought that undoubtedly Radharani enjoyed His company
and He enjoyed the company of Radharapi, but the exchange of transcendental
mellow between the spiritual couple was more pleasing to Srimati Radharani than
to Sri Krsna. Radharan’ felt more transcendental pleasure in the company of Krsna
than He could understand without taking Her position, but for Sri Krsna to enjoy
in the position of Srimati Radharani was impossible because that position was
completely foreign to Him. Krsna is the transcendental male, and Radharani is the
transcendental female. Therefore, to know the transcendental pleasure of loving
Krsna, Lord Krsna Himself appeared as Lord Caitanya, accepting the emotions and
bodily luster of Srimati Radharani.

Lord Caitanya appeared to fulfill these confidential desires and also to preach
the special significance of chanting Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare
Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, and to answer the call of
Advaita Prabhu. These were secondary reasons.

Sri 5५27002 Damodara Gosvami was the principal figure among Lord Caitanya’s
confidential devotees. The records of his diary have revealed these confidential
purposes of the Lord. These revelations have been confirmed by the statements of
Srila ২003 Gosvami in his various prayers and poems.

This chapter also specifically describes the difference between lust and love. The
transactions of Krsna and Radha are completely different from material lust. There-
fore the author has very clearly distinguished between them.

One can ascertain the meaning of this Sanskrit s/oka only when one is endowed
with the causeless mercy of Lord Caitanya. Lord Sri Krsna, being the absolute
Personality of Godhead, cannot be exposed to the mundane instruments of vision.
He reserves the right not to be exposed by the intellectual feats of nondevotees.

and His transcendental pastimes in the land of Vrndavana by the grace of Lord
Caitanya Mahaprabhu.

In the Third Chapter, fourth verse, it has been clearly said that Lord Caitanya
appeared to distribute love of Krsna and the chanting of His transcendental holy
name, Hare Krsna. That was the secondary purpose of Lord Caitanya’s appearance.
The real reason is different, as we shall see in this chapter.

PURPORT
We have information from Bhagavad-gita that the Lord appears at particular
intervals to adjust a time-worn spiritual culture. Lord Sr Krsna appeared at the end
of Dvapara-yuga to regenerate the spiritual culture of human society and also to
manifest His transcendental pastimes. Visnu is the authorized Lord who maintains
the created cosmos, and He is also the principal Deity who makes adjustments for
improper administration in the cosmic creation. ऽं Krsna is the primeval Lord, and
He appears not to make such administrative adjustments but only to exhibit His
transcendental pastimes and thus attract the fallen souls back home, back to God-
head. However, the time for administrative rectification and the time for Lord Sri
Krsna’s.appearance coincided at the end of the last Dvapara-yuga. Therefore when


--- Page 236 ---
236 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta
<न Krsna appeared, Visnu, the Lord of maintenance, also merged in Him because all
the plenary portions and parts of the absolute Personality of Godhead merge in Him
during His appearance.

TRANSLATION
The Lord's desire to appear was born from two reasons: He wanted to taste the
sweet essence of the mellows of love of God, and He wanted to propagate devotional
service in the world on the platform of spontaneous attraction. Thus He is known
as supremely jubilant and as the most merciful of all.
PURPORT
During the period of Lord Krsna’s appearance the killing of asuras or nonbelievers
such as Karhsa and Jarasandha was done by Visnu, who was within the person of Sri
Krsna. Such apparent killing by Lord Sri Krsna was a matter of course as an
incidental activity, but the real purpose of Lord Krsna’'s appearance was to stage a
dramatic performance of His transcendental pastimes at Vrajabhimi, thus exhibiting
the highest limit of transcendental mellow in the exchanges of reciprocal love be-
tween the living entity and the Supreme Lord. These reciprocal exchanges of
mellows are called raga-bhakti, or devotional service to the Lord in transcendental
rapture. Lord Sri Krsna wants to make known to all the conditioned souls that He
is more attracted by rdga-bhakti than vidhi-bhakti, or devotional service under
scheduled regulations. It is said in the Vedas, raso vai sah: the Absolute Truth is
the reservoir for all kinds of reciprocal exchanges of loving sentiments. He is aiso
causelessly merciful, and He wants to bestow upon us this privilege of rdga-bhakti.
Thus He appeared as His own internal energy. He was not forced to appear by any
extraneous force.

PURPORT
The Lord, by His inherent nature, reveals Himself before His devotees according
to their inherent devotional service. The Vrndavana pastimes demonstrated that
although generally people worship God with reverence, the Lord is more pleased
when a devotee thinks of Him as his pet son, personal friend or most dear fiance
and renders service unto Him with such natural affection. The Lord becomes a
subordinate object of love in such transcendental relationships. Such pure love of
Godhead is unadulterated by any tinge of superfluous nondevotional desires and is
not mixed with any sort of fruitive action or empiric philosophical speculation. It is
pure and natural love of Godhead, spontaneously aroused in the absolute stage.
This devotional service is executed in a favorable atmosphere freed from material
affection.

philosophy of the Gita to the sun-god. The message was received through the chain
of disciplic succession, but in course of time, the chain being broken somehow or
other, Lord $ri Krspa appeared again and taught Arjuna the truths of Bhagavad-gita.
At that time the Lord spoke this verse (Bg. 4.11) to His friend Arjuna.

TRANSLATION

“If one cherishes pure loving devotion to Me, thinking of Me as his son, his
friend or his beloved, regarding himself as great and considering Me his equal or

PURPORT

In Caitanya-caritamyta three kinds of devotional service are described—namely,
bhakti (ordinary devotional service), Suddha-bhakti {pure devotional service) and
viddha-bhakti (mixed devotional service).

When devotional service is executed with some material purpose, involving
fruitive activities, mental speculations or mystic yoga, it is called mixed or
adulterated devotional service. Besides bhakti-yoga, Bhagavad-gita also describes
karma-yoga, jndna-yoga and dhyadna-yoga. Yoga means linking with the Supreme
Lord, which is possible only through devotion. Fruitive activitiesending in devotional
service, philosophical speculation ending in devotional service, and the practice of
mysticism ending in devotional service are known respectively as karma-yoga, /2/70-
yoga and dhyana-yoga. But such devotional service is adulterated by the three kinds
of material activities.

For those grossly engaged in identifying the body as the self, pious activity, or
karma-yoga, is recommended. For those who identify the mind with the self,
philosophical speculation, or jfigna-yoga, is recommended. But devotees standing
on the spiritual platform have no need of such material conceptions of adulterated
devotion. Adulterated devotional service does not directly aim for love of the


--- Page 242 ---
242 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta

Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore service performed strictly in conformity
with the revealed scriptures is better than such viddha-bhakti because it is free from
all kinds of material contamination. It is executed in Krsna consciousness, solely to
please the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Those who are spontaneously devoted to the Lord and have no aims for material
gain are called attracted devotees. They are spontaneously attracted to the service of
the Lord, and they follow in the footsteps of self-realized souls. Their pure devotion
(Suddha-bhakti), manifested from pure love of Godhead, surpasses the regulative
principles of the authoritative scriptures. Sometimes loving ecstasy transcends regu-
lative principles; such ecstasy, however, is completely on the spiritual platform
and cannot be imitated. The regulative principles help ordinary devotees rise to the
stage of perfect love of Godhead. Pure love for Krsna is the perfection of pure de-
votion, and pure devotional service is identical with spontaneous devotional service.

Flawless execution of regulative principles is exhibited in the Vaikuntha planets.
By strictly executing these principles one can be elevated to the Vaikuntha planets.
But spontaneous pure loving service is found in Krspaloka alone.

PURPORT

Pure devotional service is represented in the activities of the residents of Vraja-
bhumi (Vyndavana). During a solar eclipse, the Lord came from [0%31313 and met
the inhabitants of Vyndavana at Samanta-paficaka. The meeting was intensely
painful for the damsels of VrajabhGimi because Lord Krsna apparently left them to


--- Page 243 ---
Adi-ila, Chapter 4 243
reside at Dvaraka. But the Lord obligingly acknowledged the pure devotional service
of the damsels of Vraja by speaking this verse (Bhag. 10.82.45).

TRANSLATION

“If My beloved consort reproaches Me in a sulky mood, that steals My mind from

PURPORT

According to the Upanisads, all living entities are dependent on the supreme
living entity, the Personality of Godhead. As it is said, nityo nityanarh cetanas
cetananam eko bahiindrh yo vidadhati kaman: one eternal living entity supports all
the other eternal living entities. Because the Supreme Personality of Godhead main-
tains all the other living entities, they remain subordinate to the Lord, even when
joined with Him in the reciprocation of loving affairs. But in the course of exchang-
ing transcendental love of the highest purity, sometimes the subordinate devotee
tries to predominate over the predominator. One who lovingly engages with the
Supreme Lord as if His mother or father sometimes supersedes the position of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly, His fiancée or lover sometimes supersedes
the position of the Lord. But such attempts are exhibitions of the highest love.
Only out of pure love does the subordinate lover of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead chide Him. The Lord, enjoying this chiding, takes it very nicely. The
exhibition of natural love makes such activities very enjoyable. In worship of the
Supreme Lord with veneration there is no manifestation of such natural love because
the devotee considers the Lord his superior.

Regulative principles in devotional service are meant for those who have not
invoked their natural love of Godhead. When natural love arises, all regulative
methods are surpassed, and pure love is exhibited between the Lord and the devotee.
Although on such a platform of love the devotee sometimes appears to predominate
over the Lord or transgress regulative principles, such dealings are far more advanced
than ordinary dealings through regulative principles with awe and veneration. A
devotee who is actually free from all designations due to complete attachment in
love for the Supreme exhibits spontaneous love for Godhead, which is always
superior to the devotion of regulative principles.

The informal language used between lover and beloved is significant of pure
affection. When devotees worship their beloved as the most venerable object,
spontaneous loving sentiments are observed to be lacking. A neophyte devotee who
follows the Vedic instructions that regulate those who lack pure love of Godhead
may superficially seem more exalted than a devotee in spontaneous love of God-
head. But in fact such spontaneous pure love is far superior to regulated devotional
service. Such pure love of Godhead is always glorious in all respects, more so than
reverental devotional service rendered by a less affectionate devotee.

PURPORT

Lord Krspa in the form of Lord Caitanya educates His devotees to develop
progressively to the stage of pure devotional service. Thus He appears periodically
as a devotee to take part in various wonderful activities depicted in His sublime
philosophy and teachings.

There are innumerable Vaikuptha planets in the spiritual sky, and in all of them
the Lord accepts the service rendered by His eternal devotees in a reverential mood.
Therefore Lord $ri Krsna presents His most confidential pastimes as He enjoys them
in His transcendental realm. Such pastimes are so attractive that they attract even
the Lord, and thus He relishes them in the form of Lord Caitanya.

PURPORT
Yogamaya is the name of the internal potency that makes the Lord forget Himself
and become an object of love for His pure devotee in different transcendental
mellows. This yogamdya potency creates a spiritual sentiment in the minds of the
damsels of Vraja by which they think of Lord Krsna as their paramour. This senti-
ment is never to be compared to mundane illicit sexual love. It has nothing to do
with sexual psychology, although the pure love of such devotees seems to be sexual.
One should know for certain that nothing can exist in this cosmic manifestation that
has no real counterpart in the spiritual field. All material manifestations are emana-
tions of the transcendence. The erotic principles of amorous love reflected in
mixed material values are perverted reflections of the reality of spirit, but one
cannot understand the reality unless one is sufficiently educated in the spiritual
science.

PURPORT
In the spiritual sky the Vaikuntha planets are predominated by Narayana. His
devotees have the same features He does, and the exchange of devotion there is on
the platform of reverence. But above all these Vaikuntha planets is Goloka, or


--- Page 247 ---
Adi-Iila, Chapter 4 247
Krsnaloka, where the original Personality of Godhead, Krsna, fully manifests His
pleasure potency in free loving affairs. Since the devotees in the material world
know almost nothing about these affairs, the Lord desires to show these|affairs to
them.,

In Goloka Vrndavana there is an exchange of love known as parakfya-rasa. It is
something like the attraction of a married woman for a man other than her husband.
In the material world this sort of relationship is most abominable because it is a
perverted reflection of the parakiya-rasa in the spiritual world, where it is the highest
kind of loving affair. Such feelings between the devotee and the Lord are presented
by the influence of yogamdyd. Bhagavad-gita states that devotees of the highest grade
are under the care of daiva-mdya, or yogamdyd. Mahdatmanas tu mdrh partha daivith
prakrtimasritah (Bg. 9.13). Those who are actually great souls (mahdtmds) are fully
absorbed in Krsna consciousness, always ‘engaged in the service of the Lord. They
are under the care of daivi prakrti, or yogamdyd. Yogamdyd creates a situation in.
which the devotee is prepared to transgress all regulative principles simply to love
Krsna. A devotee naturally does not like to.transgress the laws of reverence for the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, but by the influence of yogamdya he is prepared
to do anything to love the Supreme Lord better.

Those under the spell of the material energy cannot at all appreciate the activities
of yogamaya, for a conditioned soul can hardly understand the pure ‘reciprocation
between the Lord and His devotee. But by executing devotional service under the
regulative principles, one can become very highly elevated and then begin to
appreciate the dealings of pure love under the management of yogamaya.

In the spiritual loving sentiment induced by the yogamdya potency, both Lord Sri
Krsna and the damsels of Vraja forget themselves in spiritual rapture. By the
influence of such forgetfulness, the attractive beauty of the gop7s plays a prominent
part in the transcendental satisfaction of the Lord, who has nothing to do with
mundane sexology. Because spiritual love of Godhead is above everything mundane,
the gopis superficially seem to transgress the codes of mundane morality. This
perpetually puzzles mundane moralists. Therefore yogamdyd acts to cover the
Lord and His pastimes from the eyes of mundaners, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita,
where the Lord says that He reserves the right of not being exposed to everyone.

The acts of yogamaya make it possible for the Lord and the 8০15, in loving
ecstasy, to sometimes meet and sometimes separate. These transcendental loving
affairs of the Lord are unimaginable to empiricists involved in the impersonal feature
of the Absolute Truth. Therefore the Lord himself appears before the mundaners
to bestow upon them the highest form of spiritual realization and also personally
relish its essence. The Lord is so merciful that He Himself descends to take the
fallen souls back home to the kingdom of Godhead, where the erotic principles of
Godhead are eternally relished in their real form, distinct from the perverted sexual
love so much adored and indulged in by the fallen souls in their diseased condition.
The reason the Lord displays the rasa-/ila is essentially to induce all the fallen souls
to give up their diseased morality and religiosity, and to attract them to the king-
dom of God to enjoy the reality. A person who actually understands what the
rasa-Ifla is will certainly hate to indulge in mundane sex life. For the realized soul,

hearing the Lord’s rdsa-/ila through the proper channel will result in complete
abstinence from material sexual pleasure.

PURPORT

The gopis came out to meet Krsna in the dead of night when they heard the
sound of Krspa’s flute. Srila Ripa Gosvami has accordingly composed a nice verse
that describes the beautiful boy called Govinda standing by the bank of the Yamuna
with His flute to His lips in the shining moonlight. Those who want to enjoy life
in the materialistic way of society, friendship and love should not go to the Yamuna
to see the form of Govinda. The sound of Lord Krsna’s flute is so sweet that it has
made the gopis forget all about their relationships with their kinsmen and flee to
Krsna in the dead of night.

By leaving home in that way, the gopis have transgressed the Vedic regulations of
household life. This indicates that when natural feelings of love for Krsna become
fully manifest, a devotee can neglect conventional social rules and regulations. In
the material world we are situated in designative positions only, but pure devotional
service begins when one is freed from all designations. When love for Krsna is
awakened, then the designative positions are overcome.

The spontaneous attraction of $ri Krsna for His dearest parts and parcels generates
an enthusiasm that obliges $ri Krsna and the gopis to meet together. To celebrate
this transcendental enthusiasm, there is need of a sentiment of separation between
the lover and beloved. In the condition of material tribulation, no one wants the
pangs of separation. But in the transcendental form, the very same separation, being
absolute in its nature, strengthens the ties of love and enhances the desire of the
lover and beloved to meet. The period of separation, evaluated transcendentally, is


--- Page 249 ---
Adi-lila, Chapter 4 249
more relishable than the actual meeting, which lacks the feelings of increasing
anticipation because the lover and beloved are both present.

Many realized souls, such 25 Raghunatha 0353 Gosvami and King Kulasekhara,
have recommended with great emphasis that one develop this spontaneous love of
Godhead, even at the risk of transgressing all the traditional codes of morality and

has written in his prayers called the Manah-$iksd that one should simply worship

“Krsna manifests His eternal humanlike form and performs His pastimes to show

PURPORT

This text is from Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.33.37). The Supreme Personality of
Godhead has innumerable expansions of His transcendental form who eternally
exist in the spiritual world. This material world is only a perverted reflection of the
spiritual world, where everything is manifested without inebriety. There every-
thing is in its original existence, free from the domination of time. Time cannot
deteriorate or interfere with the conditions in the spiritual world, where different
manifestations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are the recipients of the


--- Page 251 ---
Adi-lila, Chapter 4 251
worship of different living entities in their constitutional spiritual positions. In the
spiritual world all existence is unadulterated goodness. The goodness found in the
material world is contaminated by the modes of passion and ignorance.

The saying that the human form of life is the best position for devotional service
has its special significance because only in this form can a living entity revive his
eternal relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The human form is
considered the highest state in the cycle of the species of life in the material world.
If one takes advantage of this highest kind of material form, one can regain his
position of devotional service to the Lord.

Incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead appear in all the species of
life, although this is inconceivable to the human brain. The Lord’s pastimes are
differentiated according to the appreciating capacity of the different types of bodies
of the living entities. The Supreme Lord bestows the most merciful benediction to
human society when He appears in His human form. It is then that humanity gets
the opportunity to engage in different kinds of eternal service to the Lord.

Special natural appreciation of the descriptions of a particular pastime of God-
head indicates the constitutional position of a living entity. Adoration, servitorship,
friendship, parental affection and conjugal love are the five primary relationships
with Krsna. The highest perfectional stage of the conjugal relationship, enriched by
many sentiments, gives the maximum relishable mellow to the devotee.

The Lord appears in different incarnations—as a fish, tortoise and boar, as
Parasurama, Lord Rama, Buddha and so on—to reciprocate the different apprecia-
tions of living entities in different stages of evolution. The conjugal relationship of
amorous love called parakiya-rasa is the unparalleled perfection of love exhibited
by Lord Krsna and His devotees.

A class of so-called devotees known 25 sahajiyds try to imitate the Lord’s pastimes,
although they have no understanding of the amorous love in His expansions of
pleasure potency. Their superficial imitation can create havoc on the path for the
advancement of one’s spiritual relationship with the Lord. Material sexual indulgence
can never be equated with spiritual love, which is in unadulterated goodness. The
activities of the sahajiyds simply lower one deeper into the material contamination
of the senses and mind. Krsna’s transcendental pastimes display eternal servitorship
to Adhoksaja, the Supreme Lord, who is beyond all conception through material
senses. Materialistic conditioned souls do not understand the transcendental ex-
changes of love, but they like to indulge in sense gratification in the name of devo-
tional service. The activities of the Supreme Lord can never be understood by
irresponsible persons who think the pastimes of Radha and Krsna to be ordinary
affairs. The rasa dance is arranged by Krsna’s internal potency yogamdya, and it is
beyond the grasp of the materially affected person. Trying to throw mud into
transcendence with their perversity, the sahajiyds misinterpret the sayings tat-
paratvena nirmalam and tat-paro bhavet. By misinterpreting tadrsih kridah, they
want to indulge in sex while pretending to imitate Lord Krsna. But one must
actually understand the imports of the words through the intelligence of the
authorized gosvamis. 61112 Narottama dasa Thakura, in his prayers to the Gosvamis,
has explained his inability to understand such spiritual affairs.

“When | shall be eager to understand the literature given by the Gosvamis, then |
shall be able to understand the transcendental love affairs of Radha and Krsna.”
In other words, unless one is trained under the disciplic succession of the Gosvamis,
one cannot understand Radha and Krsna. The conditioned souls are naturally
averse to understanding the spiritual existence of the Lord, and if they try to know
the transcendental nature of the Lord’s pastimes while they remain absorbed in
materialism, they are sure to blunder like the sahajiyas.

sei—that; ihd—here; kaya—says; kartavya—to be done; avasya—certainly; ei—this;

TRANSLATION

Here the use of the verb “bhavet,” which is in the imperative mood, tells us that

this certainly must be done. Noncompliance would be abandonment of duty.
PURPORT

This imperative is applicable to pure devotees. Neophytes will be able to under-
stand these affairs only after being elevated by regulated devotional service under
the expert guidance of the spiritual master. Then they too will be competent to
hear of the love affairs of Radha and Krsna.

As long as one is in material conditional life, strict discipline is required in the
matter of moral and immoral activities. The absolute world is transcendental and
free from such distinctions because there inebriety is not possible. But in this
material world a sexual appetite necessitates distinction between moral and immoral
conduct. There are no sexual activities in the spiritual world. The transactions
between lover and beloved in the spiritual world are pure transcendental love and
unadulterated bliss.

One who has not been attracted by the transcendental beauty of rasa will certainly
be dragged down into material attraction, thus to act in material contamination and
progress to the darkest region of hellish life. But by understanding the conjugal
love of Radha and Krsna one is freed from the grip of attraction to material so-called


--- Page 253 ---
Adi-fila, Chapter 4 253
love between man and woman. Similarly if one understands the pure parental love
of Nanda and Yasoda for Krsna, he will be saved from being dragged into material
parental affection. If one accepts Krsna as the supreme friend, the attraction of
material friendship will be finished for him, and he will not be dismayed by so-called
friendship with mundane wranglers. If he is attracted by servitorship to Krsna, he
will no longer have to serve the material body in the degraded status of material
existence with the false hope of becoming master in the future. Similarly, one who
sees the greatness of Krsna in neutrality will certainly never again seek the so-called
relief of impersonalist or voidist philosophy. If one is not attracted by the transcen-
dental nature of Krsna, one is sure to be attracted to material enjoyment, thus to
become implicated in the clinging network of virtuous and sinful activities and
continue material existence by transmigrating from one material body to another.
Only in Krsna consciousness can one achieve the highest perfection of life.

In this way, assuming the sentiment of a devotee, He preached devotional service

PURPORT

When 1২003 Gosvaimi met Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu at Prayaga (Allahabad),
he offered his respectful obeisances by submitting that Lord Caitanya was more
magnanimous than any other avatdra of Krsna because He was distributing love of
Krsna. His mission was to enhance love of Godhead. In the human form of life the
highestachievement is to attain the platform of love of Godhead. Lord Caitanya did
not invent a system of religion, as people sometimes assume. Religious systems are
meant to show the existence of God, who is then generally approached as the cosmic
order-supplier. But Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s transcendental mission is to
distribute love of Godhead to everyone. Anyone who accepts God as the Supreme
can take to the process of chanting Hare Krsna and become a lover of God. There-
fore Lord Caitanya is the most magnanimous. This munificent broadcasting of
devotional service is possible only for Krspa Himself. Therefore Lord Caitanya is
Krsna.

In Bhagavad-gita Krsna has taught the philosophy of surrender to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. One who has surrendered to the Supreme can make further
progress by learning to love Him. Therefore the Krsna consciousness movement
propagated by Lord Caitanya is especially meant for those who are cognizant of
the presence of the Supreme Godhead, the ultimate controller of everything. His
mission is to teach people how to dovetail themselves into engagements of transcen-
dental loving service. He is Krsna teaching His own service from the position of a


--- Page 256 ---
256 Sri Caitanya-caritamyta

devotee. The [01015 acceptance of the role of a devotee in the eternal form of Lord
SriCaitanya Mahaprabhu is another of the Lord’s wonderful features. A conditioned
soul cannot reach the absolute Personality of Godhead by his imperfect endeavor,
and therefore it is wonderful that Lord Sri Krsna, in the form of Lord Gauranga,
has made it easy for everyone to approach Him.

Svar0pa Damodara Gosvaml has described Lord Caitanya as Krsna Himself with

the attitude of Radharanf, or a combination of Radha and Krsna. His intention is
to taste Krsna's sweetness in transcendental love. Lord Caitanya does not care to
think of Himself as Krsna, because He wants the position of Radharant. We should
remember this. A class of so-called devotees called the nadfya-nagart or gaura-nagari
pretend that they have the sentiment of gopis toward Lord Caitanya, but they do
notrealize that He placed Himself not as the enjoyer, Krsna, but as the enjoyed, the
devotee of Krsna. The concoctions of unauthorized persons pretending to be bona
fide have not been accepted by Lord Caitanya. Presentations such as those of the
.gaura-ndgarT are only disturbances to the sincere execution of the mission of Lord
Caitanya. Lord Caitanya is undoubtedly Krsna Himself, and He isalways nondifferent
from Srimati 30171313101. But the emotion technically called vipralambha-bhava,
which the Lord adopted for confidential reasons, should not be disturbed in the
name of service. A mundaner should not unnecessarily intrude into affairs of
transcendence and thereby displease the Lord. One must always be on guard against
this sort of devotional anomaly. A devotee is not meant to create disturbances to
Krsna. As Srila Rapa Gosvamf has explained, devotional service is anukilyena, or
favorable to Krsna. Acting unfavorably toward Krsna is not devotion. Karhsa was
the enemy of Krsna. He always thought of Krsna, but he thought of Him as an
enemy. One should always avoid such unfavorable so-called service.

Lord Caitanya has accepted the role of Radharani, and we should support that
position, as Svartipa Damodara did in the Gambhira (the house of Lord Caitanya
Mahaprabhu at Puri). He always reminded Lord Caitanya of Radha’s feelings of
separation as they are described in the Srimad-Bhdgavatam, and Lord Caitanya
appreciated his assistance. But the gaura-nagaris, who place Lord Caitanya in the
position of enjoyer and themselves as His enjoyed, are not approved by Lord
Caitanya or by Lord Caitanya’s followers. Instead of being blessed, the foolish
imitators are left completely apart. Their concoctions are against the principles
of Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. The doctrine of transcendental enjoyment by
Krsna cannot be mixed up with the doctrine of transcendental feeling of separation
from Krsna in the role of Radharani.

No one is higher or lower than anyone else in transcendental relationships with
the Lord, for in the absolute realm everything is equal. But although these relation-
ships are absolute, there are also transcendental differences between them. Thus the
transcendental relationship of conjugal love is considered the highest perfection.

PURPORT

Of the four kinds of reciprocation of loving service—ddasya, sakhya, vatsalya and
madhurya—madhurya is considered the fullest. But the conjugal relationship is
further divided into two varieties, namely svakiya and parakiya. Svakiya is the rela-
tionship with Krsna as a formally married husband, and parakiya is the relationship
with Krsna as a paramour. Expert analysts have decided that the transcendental
ecstasy of the parakiya mellow is better because it is more enthusiastic. This phase
of conjugal love is found in those who have surrendered to the Lord in intense love,
knowing well that such illicit love with a paramour is not morally approved in
society. The risks involved in such love of Godhead make this emotion superior to
the relationship in which such risk is not involved. The validity of such risk, however,
is possible only in the transcendental realm. Svakiya and parakiya conjugal love of
Godhead have no existence in the material world, and parakiya is not exhibited
anywhere in Vaikuntha, but only in the portion of Goloka Vrndavana known as
Vraja.

Some devotees think that Krsna is eternally the enjoyer in Goloka Vrndavana but
only sometimes comes to the platform of Vraja to enjoy parakiya-rasa. The six


--- Page 261 ---
Adi-lila, Chapter 4 261
Gosvamis of Vrndavana, however, have explained that Krsna’s pastimes in Vraja are
eternal, like His other activities in Goloka Vrndavana. Vraja is a confidential part of
Goloka Vrndavana. Krsna exhibited His Vraja pastimes on the surface of this world,
and similar pastimes are eternally exhibited in Vraja in Goloka Vrndavana, where
parakiya-rasa is ever existent.

In the Third Chapter of this epic, Srila Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvamt has explicitly
accepted the fact that Krsna appears in this material world at the end of the Dvapara
age of the twenty-eighth catur-yuga of Vaivasvata Manu and brings with Him His
Vrajadhama, which is the eternal abode of His highest pastimes. As the Lord appears
by His own internal potency, so He also brings all His paraphernalia by the same
internal potency, without extraneous help. It is further stated here in Caitanya-
caritamyta that the parakiya sentiment is existent only in that transcendental realm
and nowhere else. This highest form of ecstasy can exist only in the most confidential.
part of the transcendental world, but by the causeless mercy of the Lord we can
have a peep into that invisible Vraja.

The transcendentai mellow relished by the gopfs in Vraja is superexcellently
featured in Srimatf Radharani. Mature assimilation of the transcendental humor of
conjugal love is represented by Srimatf Radharanf, whose feelings are incomprehen-
sible even to the Lord Himself. The intensity of Her loving service is the highest
form of ecstasy. No one can surpass Srimatf Radharantin relishing the transcendental
mellow qualities of the Lord. Therefore the Lord Himself agreed to assume the
position of Radharani in the form of Lord Sri Gauranga. He then relished the
highest position of parakiya-rasa, as exhibited in the transcendental abode of Vraja.

PURPORT

The two transcendentalists Radha and Krsna are a puzzle to materialists. The
above description of Radha and Krsna from the diary of Srila Svarupa Damodara
Gosvami is a condensed explanation, but one needs great spiritual insight to under-
stand the mystery of these two personalities. One is enjoying in two. Sri Krsna is the
potent factor, and Srimati Radharani is the internal potency. According to Vedanta
philosophy, there is no difference between the potent and potency; they are identical.
We cannot differentiate between one and the other, any more than we can separate
fire from heat.


--- Page 265 ---
Adi-lila, Chapter 4 265

Everything in the Absolute is inconceivable in relative existence. Therefore in
relative cognizance it is very difficult to assimilate this truth of the oneness between
the potentand the potency. The philosophy of inconceivable oneness and difference
propounded by Lord Caitanya is the only source of understanding for such intricacies
of transcendence.

In fact, Radharani is the internal potency of Sri Krsna, and She eternally intensi-
fies the pleasure of ऽ Krsna. Impersonalists cannot understand this without the
help of a mahd-bhdgavata devotee. The very name Radha suggests that She is
eternally the topmost mistress of the comforts of Sri Krsna. As such, She is the
medium transmitting the living entities’ service to ऽं Krsna. Devotees in Vindavana
therefore seek the mercy of Srimatt Radharani in order to be recognized as loving
servitors of $ri Krsna.

Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu personally approaches the fallen conditioned souls
of the iron age to deliver the highest principle of transcendental relationships with
the Lord. The activities of Lord Caitanya are primarily in the role of the pleasure-
giving portion of His internal potency.

The absolute Personality of Godhead, $ri Krsna, is the omnipotent form of tran-
scendental existence, knowledge and bliss in full. His internal potency is exhibited
first as sat, or existence—or, in other words, as the portion that expands the existence
function of the Lord. The same potency while displaying full knowledge is called
cit, or samvit, which expands the transcendental forms of the Lord. Finally, the
same potency while playing 25 a pleasure-giving medium is known as Aladini, or the
transcendental blissful potency. Thus the Lord manifests His internal potency in
three transcendental divisions.

Srila Jiva Gosvami has elaborately discussed the hfadini potency in his Priti-
sandarbha. He says that the Vedas clearly state, ‘Only devotional service can lead
one to the Personality of Godhead. Only devotional service can help a devotee meet
the Supreme Lord face to face. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is attracted
by devotional service, and as such the ultimate supremacy of Vedic knowledge rests
in knowing the science of devotional service.”

What is the particular attraction that makes the Supreme Lord enthusiastic to
accept devotional service, and what is the nature of such service? The Vedic scriptures
inform us that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, is self-
sufficient, and that mdyd, nescience, can never influence Him at all. As such, the
potency that overcomes the Supreme must be purely spiritual. Such a potency can-
not be anything of the material manifestation. The bliss enjoyed by the Supreme
Personality of Godhead cannot be of material composition like the impersonalist con-
ception of the bliss of Brahman. Devotional service is reciprocation between two,
and therefore it cannot be located simply within one’s self. Therefore the bliss of
self-realization, brahmdnanda, cannot be equated with devotional service.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead has three kinds of internal potency,
namely the hlddini, or pleasure potency, sandhini, or existential potency, and
samvit, or cognitive potency. In the Vispu Purana (1.12.69) the Lord is addressed
as follows: “O Lord, You are the support of everything. The three attributes
hladini, sandhini and samvit exist in You as one spiritual energy. But the material
modes, which cause happiness, misery and mixtures of the two, do not exist in You,
for You have no material qualities.”

Hladini is the personal manifestation of the blissfulness of the Supreme Person-
ality of Godhead, by which He enjoys pleasure. Because the pleasure potency is
perpetually present in the Supreme Lord, the theory of the impersonalist that the
Lord appears in the material mode of goodness cannot be accepted. The impersonal-
ist conclusion is against the Vedic version that the Lord possesses a transcendental
pleasurepotency. When the pleasure potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead
is exhibited by His grace in the person of a devotee, that manifestation is called love
of God. Love of God is another epithet of the pleasure potency of the Lord. There-
fore devotional service reciprocated between the Lord and His devotee is an exhibi-
tion of the transcendental pleasure potency of the Lord.

The potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead that always enriches Him
with transcendental bliss is not material, but the Sankarites have accepted it as such
because they are ignorant of the identity of the Supreme Lord and His pleasure
potency. Those ignorant persons cannot understand the distinction between
impersonal spiritual bliss and the variegatedness of the spiritual pleasure potency.
The hladini potency gives the Lord all transcendental pleasure, and the Lord
bestows such a potency upon His pure devotee.

PURPORT
In his thesis Bhagavat-sandarbha (verse 102), Srila |1५2 Gosvami explains the
potencies of the Lord as follows. The transcendental potency of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead by which He maintains His existence is called sandhini.
The transcendental potency by which He knows Himself and causes others to know
Him is called samvit. The transcendental potency by which He possesses transcen-
dental bliss and causes His devotees to have bliss is called hladini.


--- Page 269 ---
Adi-fila, Chapter 4 269

The total exhibition of these potencies is called viSuddha-sattva, and this platform
of spiritual variegatedness is displayed even in the material world, when the Lord
appears here. The pastimes and manifestations of the Lord in the material world
are therefore not at all material; they belong to the pure transcendental state.
Bhagavad-gita confirms that anyone who understands the transcendental nature of
the Lord’s appearance, activities and disappearance becomes eligible for freedom
from material bondage upon quitting the present material tabernacle. He can enter
the spiritual kingdom to associate with the Supreme Personality of Godhead and
reciprocate the hladini potency in transactions between him and the Lord. In the
mundane mode of goodness there are tinges of passion and ignorance. Therefore
mundane goodness, being mixed, is called mi$ra-sattva. But the transcendental
variegatedness of viSuddha-sattva is completely free from all mundane qualities.
Visuddha-sattva is therefore the proper atmosphere in which to experience the
Personality of Godhead and His transcendental pastimes. Spiritual variegatedness
is eternally independent of all material conditions and is nondifferent from the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, both being absolute. The Lord and His devotees
simultaneously perceive the Aladin potency directly by the power of samvit.

The material modes of nature control the conditioned souls, but the Supreme
Personality of Godhead is never influenced by these modes, as all Vedic literatures
directly and indirectly corroborate. Lord Krsna Himself says in the Eleventh
Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam, sattvar rajas tama iti gupd jivasya naiva me: “The
material modes of goodness, passion and ignorance are connected with the con-
ditioned souls, but never with Me, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.” The Vispu
Purana confirms this as follows:

sattvadayo na santise

“The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu, is beyond the three qualities goodness,
passion and ignorance. No material qualities exist in Him. May that original person,
Narayana, who is situated in a completely transcendental position, be pleased with
us.” In the Tenth Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam, Indra praised Krsna as follows:
viSuddha-sattvarh tava dhama Santarn
tapomayarn dhvasta-rajas-tamaskam
mayamayo ‘yam guna-sampravaho
na vidyate te 'grahapanubandhah
“My dear Lord, Your abode is visuddha-sattva, always undisturbed by the material
qualities, and the activities there are in transcendental loving service unto Your
feet. The goodness, austerity and penance of the devotees enhance such activities,
which are always free from the contamination of passion and ignorance. Material
qualities cannot touch You under any circumstances.” (Bhdg. 10.27.4)

When not manifested, the modes of material nature are said to be in goodness.
When they are externally manifested and active in producing the varieties of
material existence, they are said to be in passion. And when there is a lack of
activity and variegatedness, they are said to be in ignorance. In other words, the
pensive mood is goodness, activity is passion, and inactivity is ignorance. Above all
these mundane qualitative manifestations is viSuddha-sattva. When it is predomi-
nated by sandhini, it is perceivable as the existence of all that be. When predominated
by samvit, it is perceived as knowledge in transcendence. And when predominated
by hladini, it is perceived as the most confidential love of Godhead. Visuddha-sattva,
the simultaneous manifestation of these three in one, is the main feature of the
kingdom of God.

The Absolute Truth is therefore the substance of reality, eternally manifest in
three energies. The manifestation of the internal energy of the Lord is the incon-
ceivable variegatedness, the manifestation of the marginal energy is the living entity,
and the manifestation of the external energy is the material cosmos. Therefore the
Absolute Truth includes these four principles—the Supreme Personality of Godhead
Himself, His internal energy, His marginal energy and His external energy. The form
of the Lord and the expansions of His form as svayari-riipa and vaibhava-prakasa
are directly the enjoyers of the internal energy, which is the eternal exhibitor of the
spiritual world, the most confidential of the manifestations of energy. The external
manifestation, the material energy, provides the covering bodies of the conditioned
living entities, from Brahma down to the insignificant ant. This covering energy is
manifested under the three modes of material nature and appreciated in various
ways by living entities in both the higher and lower forms of life.

Each of the three divisions of the internal potency—the sandhini, samvit and
hladini energies—influences one of the external potencies by which the conditioned
souls are conducted. Such influence manifests the three qualitative modes of
material nature, proving definitely that the living entities, the marginal potency,
are eternally servitors of the Lord and are therefore controlled by either the internal
or the external potency.

TRANSLATION

Krsna's mother, father, abode, house, bedding, seats and so on are all transforma-
tions of suddha-sattva.

PURPORT

Lord Krspa’s father, mother and household affairs are all displayed in the same
visuddha-sattva existence. A living entity situated in the status of pure goodness can
understand the form, quality and other features of the Supreme Personality of God-
head. Krsna consciousness begins on the platform of pure goodness. Although there
is a faint realization of Krsna at first, Krsna is actually realized as Vasudeva, the
absolute proprietor of omnipotence or the prime predominating Deity of all
potencies. When the living entity is situated in viSuddha-sattva, transcendental to
the three material modes of nature, he can perceive the form, quality and other
features of the Supreme Personality of Godhead through his service attitude. The
status of pure goodness is the platform of understanding, for the Supreme Lord is
always in spiritual existence.

Krsna is always all-spiritual. Aside from the parents of the Personality of God-
head, all the other paraphernalia of His existence is also essentially a manifestation of
sandhini Sakti, or a transformation of visuddha-sattva. To make this more clear, it
may be said that this sandhini sakti of the internal potency maintains and manifests
all the variegatedness of the spiritual world. In the kingdom of God, the Lord’s
servants and maidservants, His consorts, His father and mother and everything else
are all transformations of the spiritual existence of sandhini Sakti. The existential
sandhini Sakti in the external potency similarly expands all the variegatedness of the
material cosmos, from which we can have a glimpse of the spiritual field.

This text from Srimad-Bhagavatam (4.3.23), spoken by Lord Siva when he con-
demned Daksa, the father of Sati, as an opponent of Visnu, confirms beyond a

tion with His paraphernalia exist in the sandhini sakti of the 0105 internal potency.

TRANSLATION
The essence of the samvit potency is knowledge that the Supreme Personality
of Godhead is Lord Krsna. All other kinds of knowledge, such as the knowledge of
Brahman, are its components.
PURPORT
The activities of the samvit-sakti produce the effect of cognition. Both the Lord
and the living entities are cognizant. Sri Krsna, as the Supreme Personality of God-
head, has full knowledge of everything everywhere, and therefore there are no
hindrances to His cognition. He can have knowledge merely by glancing over an
object, whereas innumerable impediments block the cognition of ordinary living
beings. The cognition of the living beings has three divisions: direct knowledge,
indirect knowledge and perverted knowledge. Sense perception of material objects
by the mundane senses, such as the eye, ear, nose and hand, always produces
definitely perverted knowledge. This illusion is a presentation of the material
energy, which is influenced by the samvit-sakti in a perverted manner. Negative
cognition of an object beyond the reach of sense perception is the way of indirect
knowledge, which is not altogether imperfect but which produces only fragmentary


--- Page 274 ---
274 Sri Caitanya-caritamyta
knowledge in the form of impersonal spiritual realization and monism. But when
the samvit factor of cognition is enlightened by the hladini potency of the same
internal energy, they work together, and only thus can one attain knowledge of the
Personality of Godhead. The samvit-$akti should be maintained in that state. Material
knowledge and indirect spiritual knowledge are by-products of the sarmvit-Sakti.

sara—the essence of such love; bhgva—emotion; bhdvera—of emotion; parama-kastha

TRANSLATION
The essence of the hladini potency is love of God, the essence of love of God is
emotion [bhava], and the ultimate development of emotion is mahabhava.
PURPORT
The product of the hladini Sakti is love of Godhead, which has two divisions—
namely, pure love of Godhead and adulterated love of Godhead. Only when the
hladini Sakti emanates from Sri Krsna and is bestowed upon the living being to
attract Him does the living being become a pure lover of God. But when the same
hladini Sakti is adulterated by the external material energy and emanates from the
living being, it does not attract Krsna; on the contrary, the living being becomes
attracted by the glamor of the material energy. At that time instead of becoming
mad with love of Godhead, the living being becomes mad after material sense
enjoyment, and because of his association with the qualitative modes of material
nature, he is captivated by its interactions of distressful, unhappy feelings.

$i Radha Thakurani is the embodiment of mahabhava. She is the repository of

PURPORT
The unadulterated action of the hlddini Sakti is displayed in the dealings of the
damsels of Vraja and $rimati Radharani, who is the topmost participant in that
transcendental group. The essence of the hlddini Sakti is love of Godhead, the
essence of love of Godhead is bhdva, or transcendental sentiment, and the highest
pitch of that bhdva is called mahdbhava. Srimati Radharani is the personified em-
bodiment of these three aspects of transcendental consciousness. She is therefore
the highest principle in love of Godhead and is the supreme lovable object of Sri
Krsna.

TRANSLATION

Her mind, senses and body are steeped in love for Krsna. She is Krsna's own

energy, and She helps Him in His pastimes.
PURPORT

Srimati Radharani is as fully spiritual as Krsna. No one should consider Her to
be material. She is definitely not like the conditioned souls, who have mental
bodies, gross and subtle, covered by material senses. She is all-spiritual, and both
Her body and mind are of the same spiritual embodiment. Because Her body is
spiritual, Her senses are also spiritual. Thus Her body, mind and senses fully shine
in love of Krsna. She is the personified hladini Sakti (the pleasure-giving energy of
the Lord’s internal potency), and therefore She is the only source of enjoyment for
$ri Krsna.

Sri Krsna cannot enjoy anything that is internally different from Him. Therefore
Radha and Sri Krsna are identical. The sandhini portion of Sri Krsna’s internal
potency has manifested the all-attractive form of Sri Krsna, and the same internal
potency, in the hladini feature, has presented Srimati Radharani, who is the attrac-
tion for the all-attractive. No one can match $rimati Radharan in the transcendental
pastimes of Sri Krsna.

PURPORT
As already explained, Krsna and Radha are one in two. They are identical. Krsna
expands Himself in multi-incarnations and plenary portions like the purusas. Simi-
larly, Srimati Radharani expands Herself in multi-forms 25 the goddesses of fortune,
the queens and the damsels of Vraja. Such expansions from Srimati 1২301731311 are
all Her plenary portions. All these womanly forms of Krsna are expansions corre-
sponding to His plenary expansions of Visnu forms. These expansions have been
compared to reflected forms of the original form. There is no difference between
the original and reflected forms. The female reflections of Krsna’s pleasure potency
are as good as Krsna Himself.
The plenary expansions of Krsna's personality are called vaibhava-vilasa and
vaibhava-prakasa, and Radha’s expansions are similarly described. The goddesses of
fortune are vaibhava-vilasa, and the queens are vaibhava-prakasa of Radharani. The


--- Page 281 ---
Adi-ila, Chapter 4 281
personal associates of Radharani, the damsels of Vraja, are direct expansions of Her
body. As expansions of Her personal form and transcendental disposition, they are
agents of different reciprocations of love in the pastimes of Lord Krsna, under the
supreme direction of Srimati Radharani. In the transcendental realm, enjoyment is
fully relished in variety. The exuberance of transcendental mellow is increased by
the association of a large number of personalities similar to Radharani, who are also
known as gopis or sakhis. The variety of innumerable mistresses is a source of relish
for $rT Krsna, and therefore these expansions from Srimati Radharani are necessary
for enhancing the pleasure potency of Sri Krsna. Their transcendental exchanges of
love are the superexcellent affairs of the pastimes in Vrndavana. By these expansions
of Srimati Radharani's personal body, She helps Lord Krsna taste the rasa dance
and similar other activities. Srimati Radharani, being the central petal of the rasa-
lila flower, is also known by the names found in the following verses.

love, His loving potency, Radharani, being nondifferent from Him, is called
krsnamayf.

TRANSLATION

Svariipa Gosahi is the most intimate associate of the Lord. He, therefore, knows
all these topics well.

PURPORT

Prior to the Lord’s acceptance of the renounced order, Purusottama Bhattacarya,
a resident of Navadvipa, desired to enter the renounced order of life. Therefore he
left home and went to Benares, where he accepted the position of brahmacarya
from a Mayavadi sannyasi. When he became a brahmacari, he was given the name
Sri Damodara 53103. He left Benares shortly after, without taking sannydasa, and
he came to Nilacala, Jagannatha Puri, where Lord Caitanya was staying. He met
Caitanya Mahaprabhu there and dedicated his life for the service of the Lord. He
became Lord Caitanya’s secretary and constant companion. He used to enhance the
pleasure potency of the Lord by singing appropriate songs, which were very much
appreciated. SvarGpa Damodara could understand the secret mission of Lord
Caitanya, and it was by his grace only that all the devotees of Lord Caitanya could
know the real purpose of the Lord.

७५२1004 Damodara has been identified as Lalitadevi, the second expansion of
Radharani. However, the authoritative Gaura-ganoddesa-dipika of Kavi-karnaptra
describes Svartipa [21110 6212 25 the same Visakhadevi who serves the Lord in Goloka
Vyndavana. Therefore it is to be understood that Sri Svariipa Damodara is a direct
expansion of Radharani who helps the Lord experience the attitude of Radharani.

—of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu;antara—the heart; sei—that; bhave—in the condition;
sukha-duhkha—happiness and distress; uthe—arise; nirantara—constantly.

TRANSLATION

The heart of Lord Caitanya is the image of ৩11 Radhika’s emotions. Thus feelings

of pleasure and pain arise constantly therein.
PURPORT

Lord Caitanya's heart was full of the feelings of Srimatt Radharant, and His

appearance resembled Hers. SvarGpa Damodara has explained His attitude as radha-


--- Page 292 ---
292 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta

bhava-marti, the attitude of Radharani. One who engages in sense gratification on
the material platform can hardly understand rddhd-bhdva, but one who is freed
from the demands of sense gratification can understand it. Radha-bhava must be
understood from the Gosvamis, those who are actually controllers of the senses.
From such authorized sources it is to be known that the attitude of Srimati
Radharani is the highest perfection of conjugal love, which is the highest of the
five transcendental mellows, and it is the complete perfection of love of Krsna.

These transcendental affairs can be understood on two platforms. One is called
elevated, and the other is called super-elevated. The loving affairs exhibited in
Dvaraka are the elevated form. The super-elevated position is reached in the mani-
festations of the pastimes of Vrndavana. The attitude of Lord Caitanya is certainly
super-elevated.

From the life of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, an intelligent person engaged in pure
devotional service can understand that He always felt separation from Krsna within
Himself. In that separation He sometimes felt that He had found Krsna and was
enjoying the meeting. The significance of this separation and meeting is very specific.
If someone tries to understand the exalted position of Lord Caitanya without
knowing this, he is sure to misunderstand it. One must first become fully self-
realized. Otherwise he may misidentify the Lord as ndgara, or the enjoyer of the
damsels of Vraja, thus committing the mistake of rasabhdsa, or overlapping
understanding.

viraha—from separation from Lord Krsna; unmada—the madness; bhrama-maya—
erroneous; cestd—efforts; ara—and; pralapa-maya—delirious; vada—talk.

TRANSLATION

In the final portion of His pastimes, Lord Caitanya was obsessed with the madness

of separation from Lord Krsna. He acted in erroneous ways and talked deliriously.
PURPORT

Lord Sri Caitanya exhibited the highest stage of the feelings of a devotee in
separation from the Lord. This exhibition was sublime because He was completely
perfect in the feelings of separation. Materialists, however, cannot understand this.
Sometimes materialistic scholars think He was diseased or crazy. Their problem is
that they always engage in material sense gratification and can never understand


--- Page 293 ---
Adi-lila, Chapter 4 293
the feelings of the devotees and the Lord. Materialists are most abominable in their
ideas. They think that they can enjoy directly perceivable gross objects by their
senses and that they can similarly deal with the transcendental features of Lord
Caitanya. But the Lord is understood only in pursuance of the principles laid down
by the Gosvamis, headed by Svaripa Damodara. Doctrines like those of the nadiya-
nagaris, a class of so-called devotees, are never presented by authorized persons like
७\/21 [0 Damodara or the six Gosvamis. The ideas of the gaurdnga-nagaris are simply
a mental concoction, and they are completely on the mental platform.

darsane—in seeing Sri Uddhava; sei—that; bhave—in the state; matta—maddened;

TRANSLATION

Just as Radhika went mad at the sight of Uddhava, so Lord Caitanya was

obsessed day and night with the madness of separation.
PURPORT

Those under the shelter of the lotus feet of $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu can under-
stand that His mode of worship of the Supreme Lord Krsna in separation is the real
worship of the Lord. When the feelings of separation become very intense, one
attains the stage of meeting $ri Krsna.

So-called devotees like the sahajiyas cheaply imagine they are meeting Krsna in
Vrndavana. Such thinking may be useful, but actually meeting Krsna is possible
through the attitude of separation taught by $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.

Visaya and asraya are two very significant words relating to the reciprocation
between Krsna and His devotee. The devotee is called the d$raya, and his beloved,
Krsna, is the visaya. Different ingredients are involved in the exchange of love
between the 24/८0 and visaya, which are known 25 vibhava, anubhava, sattvika and
vyabhicari. Vibhava is divided into the two categories d/armbana and uddipana.
Alambana may be further divided into @sraya and visaya. In the loving affairs of
Radha and 10903, Radharani is the asraya feature and Krsna thevisaya The transcen-
dental consciousness of the Lord tells Him, “| am Krsna, and | experience pleasure
as the visaya. The pleasure enjoyed by Radharani, the dsraya, is many times greater
than the pleasure | feel” Therefore, to feel the pleasure of the dsraya category, Lord
Krsna appeared 25 911 Caitanya Mahaprabhu.

।< {5725 attractiveness is wonderful and unlimited. No one can know the end of it.
Srimati Radharani alone can relish such extensiveness from Her position in the
asraya category. The mirror of Srimati Radharani’s transcendental love is perfectly
clear, yet it appears clearer and clearest in the transcendental method of under-
standing Krsna. In the mirror of Radharani’s heart, the transcendental features of
Krsna appear increasingly new and fresh. In other words, the attraction of Krsna
increases in proportion to the understanding of $rimati Radharani. Each tries to
supersede the other. Neither wants to be defeated in increasing the intensity of love.
Desiring to understand Radharani’s attitude of increasing love, Lord Krsna appeared
as $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.

TRANSLATION
[The gopis say:] ““O friends, those eyes that see the beautiful faces of the sons of
Maharaja Nanda are certainly fortunate. As these two sons enter the forest, sur-
rounded by Their friends, driving the cows before Them, They hold Their flutes to
Their mouths and glance lovingly upon the residents of Vrndavana. For those who
have eyes, we think there is no greater object of vision.”
PURPORT
Like the gopis, one can see Krsna continuously if one is fortunate enough. In the
Brahma-sarhhita it is said that sages whose eyes have been smeared with the oint-
ment of pure love can see the form of Syamasundara (Krsna) continuously in the
centers of their hearts. This text from $rimad-Bhdgavatam (10.21.7) was sung by
the 00/75 on the advent of the Sarat season.

As already explained, the position of the 40/85 in their loving dealings with Krsna
is transcendental. Their emotion is called riadha-bhdva. Although it is apparently
like mundane sex, one should not confuse it with mundane sexual love, for it is
pure and unadulterated love of Godhead.

senses; iccha—~desire; dhare—holds; prema— love; nama—the name.

TRANSLATION
The desire to gratify one’s own senses is kama [lust], but the desire to please the
senses of Lord Krsna is prema [love].
PURPORT
The revealed scriptures describe pure love as follows:
sarvatha dhvarnsa-rahitarn
saty api dhvarsa-karane
yad bhava-bandhanari yianoh
sa prema parikirtitah
“If there is ample reason for the dissolution of a conjugal relationship and yet such
adissolutiondoes not take place, such a relationship of intimate love is called pure.”

The predominated gopis were bound to Krsna in such pure love. For them there
was no question of sexual love based on sense gratification. Their only engagement
in life was to see Krsna happy in all respects, regardless of their own personal in-
terests. They dedicated their souls only for the satisfaction of the Personality of
Godhead, Sri Krsna. There was not the slightest tinge of sexual love between the
gopis and Krsna.

The author of 6/7 Caitanya-caritamrta asserts with authority that sexual love is a
matter of personal sense enjoyment. All the regulative principles in the Vedas
pertaining to desires for popularity, fatherhood, wealth and so on are different
phases of sense gratification. Acts of sense gratification may be performed under
the cover of public welfare, nationalism, religion, altruism, ethical codes, Biblical
codes, health directives, fruitive action, bashfulness, tolerance, personal comfort,
liberation from material bondage, progress, family affection or fear of social
ostracism or legal punishment, but all these categories are different subdivisions of
one substance—sense gratification. All such good acts are performed basically for
one’s own sense gratification, for no one can sacrifice his personal interest while
discharging these much-advertised moral and religious principles. But above all this
is a transcendental stage in which one feels himself to be only an eternal servitor of
Krsna, the absolute Personality of Godhead. All acts performed in this sense of
servitude are called pure love of God because they are performed for the absolute
sense gratification of ঠা Krsna. However, any act performed for the purpose of
enjoying its fruits or results is an act of sense gratification. Such actions are visible
sometimes in gross and sometimes in subtle forms.

Social customs, scriptural injunctions, bodily demands, fruitive action, shyness,
patience, bodily pleasures, self-gratification and the path of varpasrama dharma,
which is difficult to give up—the gopis have forsaken all these, as well as their own
relatives and their punishment and scolding, for the sake of serving Lord Krsna.
They render loving service to Him for the sake of His enjoyment.

TRANSLATION
That is called firm attachment to Lord Krsna. It is spotlessly pure, like a clean
cloth that has no stain.
PURPORT
The author of $ri Caitanya-caritamrta advises everyone to give up all engagements
of sense gratification and, like the gopis, dovetail oneself entirely with the will of
the Supreme Lord. That is the ultimate instruction of Krsna in Bhagavad-gita. We
should be prepared to do anything and everything to please the Lord, even at the
risk of violating the Vedic principles or ethical laws. That is the standard of love of
Godhead. Such activities in pure love of Godhead are as spotless as white linen that
has been completely washed. Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura warns us in this connection
that we should not mistakenly think that the idea of giving up everything implies
the renunciation of duties necessary in relation to the body and mind. Even such
duties are not sense gratification if they are undertaken in a spirit of service to
Krsna.

TRANSLATION
“In whatever way My devotees surrender unto Me, | reward them accordingly.
Everyone follows My path in all respects, O son of Prtha.”
PURPORT
Krsna was never ungrateful to the 4027, for as He declares to Arjuna in this verse
from Bhagavad-gita (4.11), He reciprocates with His devotees in proportion to the
transcendental loving service they render unto Him. Everyone follows the path that
leads toward Him, but there are different degrees of progress on that path, and the
Lord is realized in proportion to one’s advancement. The path is one, but the
progress in approaching the ultimate goal is different, and therefore the proportion
of realization of this goal—namely the absolute Personality of Godhead—is also
different. The gopis attained the highest goal, and Lord Caitanya affirmed that
there is no higher method of worshiping God than that followed by the 4०75.

TRANSLATION
Now whatever affection we see the gopis show in their own bodies, know it for
certain to be only for the sake of Lord Krsna.
PURPORT
The selfless love of Godhead exhibited by the gopis cannot have any parallel.
We should not, therefore, misunderstand the carefulness of the gopis in their
personal decoration. The 40275 dressed themselves as beautifully as possible, just to
make Krsna happy by seeing them. They had no ulterior desires. They dedicated
their bodies, and everything they possessed, to the service of Sri Krsna, taking for
granted that their bodies were meant for His enjoyment. They dressed themselves on
the understanding that Krsna would be happy by seeing and touching them.

TRANSLATION
For this contradiction | see only one solution: the joy of the gopis lies in the joy
of their beloved Krsna.
PURPORT
The situation of the gopis is perplexing, for although they did not want personal
happiness, it was imposed upon them. The solution to this perplexity is that Sri
Krsna’s sense of happiness is limited by the happiness of the gopis. Devotees at
Vrndavana therefore try to serve the 40/75, namely Radharani and Her associates.
If one gains the favor of the 40/77, he easily gains the favor of Krsna because on the
recommendation of the gopis Krsna at once accepts the service of a devotee. Lord
Caitanya, therefore, wanted to please the 40/75 instead of Krsna. But His contem-
poraries misunderstood Him, and for this reason Lord Caitanya renounced the order
of householder life and became a sannyasi.

Therefore we find that the joy of the gopis nourishes the joy of Lord Krsna. For
that reason the fault of lust is not present in their love.
PURPORT
By looking at the beautiful gopis Krsna becomes enlivened, and this enlivens the
gopis, whose youthful faces and bodies blossom. This competition of increasing
beauty between the 40/75 and Krsna, which 15 without limitations, is so delicate that
sometimes mundane moralists mistake these dealings to be purely amorous. But these
affairs are not at all mundane, because the gopis’ intense desire to satisfy Krsna
surcharges the entire scene with pure love of Godhead, with not a spot of sexual
indulgence.

TRANSLATION
Whenever there is unselfish love, that is its style. The reservoir of love derives
pleasure when the lovable object is pleased. When the pleasure of love interferes
with the service of Lord Krsna, the devotee becomes angry toward such ecstasy.
PURPORT
As mentioned above, the 427 are the predominated lovers, and Sri Krsna is the
predominator, the beloved. The love of the predominated nourishes the love of the
predominator. The gop7s had no desire for selfish enjoyment. Their feeling of happi-
ness was indirect, for it was dependent on the pleasure of Krsna. Causeless love of
Godhead is always so. Such pure love is possible only when the predominated is
made happy by the happiness of the predominator. Such unadulterated love is
exemplified when the lover deprecates her happiness in service that hinders her
from discharging it.

TRANSLATION
All the other gopis help increase the joy of Krspa's pastimes with Radharapi. The
gopis act as the instruments of Their mutual enjoyment.
PURPORT
It is said that the gopis are divided into five groups, namely the sakhis, nitya-
sakhis, prana-sakhis, priya-sakhis and parama-prestha-sakhis. All these fair-
complexioned associates of Srimati Radharant, the Queen of Vrndavana-dhama,
are expert artists in evoking erotic sentiments in Krsna. The parama-prestha-sakhis
are eight in number, and in the ecstatic dealings of Krsna and Radha they side
sometimes with Krsna and at other times with Radharani, just to create a situation
in which it appears that they favor one against the other. That makes the exchange
of mellows more palatable.

Adil

This chapter is chiefly devoted to describing the essential nature and glories of
Sri Nityananda Prabhu. Lord 57 Krsna is the absolute Personality of Godhead, and
His first expansion in a form for pastimes is $ri Balarama.

Beyond the limitation of this material world is the spiritual sky, paravyoma,
which has many spiritual planets, the supreme of which is called Krsnaloka.
Krsnaloka, the abode of Krsna, has three divisions, which are known as Dvaraka,
Mathura and Gokula. In that abode the Personality of Godhead expands Himself
into four plenary portions—Krsna, Balarama, Pradyumna (the transcendental Cupid)
and Aniruddha. They are known as the original quadruple forms.

In Krsnaloka is a transcendental place known as Svetadvipa or Vrndavana. Below
1৫150310163, in the spiritual sky, are the Vaikuntha planets. On each Vaikuntha
planet a four-handed Narayana, expanded from the first quadruple manifestation,
is present. The Personality of Godhead known as Sri Balarama in Krsnaloka is the
original Sankarsana (attracting Deity), and from this Sarikarsana expands another
Sankarsana, called Maha-Sankarsana, who resides in one of the Vaikuntha planets.
By His internal potency, Maha-Sarnkarsana maintains the transcendental existence
of all the planets in the spiritual sky, where all the living beings are eternally
liberated souls. The influence of the material energy is conspicuous there by its
absence. On those planets the second quadruple manifestation is present.

Outside of the Vaikuntha planets is the impersonal manifestation of Sri Krsna,
which is known as the Brahmaloka. On the other side of the Brahmaloka is the
spiritual karana-samudra, or Causal Ocean. The material energy exists on the other
side of the Causal Ocean, without touching it. In the Causal Ocean is Maha-Visnu,
the original purusa expansion from Sankarsana. This Maha-Visnu places His glance
over the material energy, and by a reflection of His transcendental body He
amalgamates Himself within the material elements.

As the source of the material elements, the material energy is known as pradhana,
and as the source of the manifestations of the material energy it is known as maya.
But material nature is inert in that she has no independent power to do anything.
She is empowered to make the cosmic manifestation by the glance of Maha-Visnu.
Therefore the material energy is not the original cause of the material manifestation.
Rather, the transcendental glance of Maha-Visnu over material nature produces that
cosmic manifestation.

Maha-Visnu again enters every universe as the reservoir of all living entities,
Garbhodakasayi Visnu. From Garbhodakasayi Visnu expands Ksirodakasayi Visnu,
the Supersoul of every living entity. Garbhodakasayi Visnu also has His own
Vaikuntha planet in every universe, where He lives as the Supersoul or supreme

371


--- Page 371 ---
372 সা Caitanya-caritimyta

controller of the universe. Garbhodakasayi Visnu reclines in the midst of the
watery portion of the universe and generates the first living creature of the universe,
Brahma. The imaginary universal form is a partial manifestation of Garbhodakasayi
Visnu.

In the Vaikuntha planet in every universe is an ocean of milk, and within that
ocean is an island called Svetadvipa, where Lord Vispu lives. Therefore this chapter
describes two Svetadvipas—one in the abode of Krsna and the other in the ocean of
milk in every universe. The Svetadvipa in the abode of Krsna is identical with
Vrndavana-dhama, which is the place where Krsna appears Himself to display His
loving pastimes. In the Svetadvipa within every universe is a Sesa form of Godhead
who serves Visnu by assuming the form of His umbrella, slippers, couch, pillows,
garments, residence, sacred thread, throne and so on.

Lord Baladeva in Krsnaloka is Nityananda Prabhu. Therefore Nityananda Prabhu
is the original 53171315313, and Maha-Sarikarsana and His expansions 25 the purusas
in the universes are plenary expansions of Nityananda Prabhu.

In this chapter the author has described the history of his leaving home for a
personal pilgrimage to Vrndavana and his achieving all success there. In this descrip-
tion it is revealed that the author’s original paternal home and birthplace were in
the district of Katwa, in the village of Jhamatapura, which is near Naihati. Krgnadasa
Kaviraja's brother invited $ri Minaketana Ramadasa, a great devotee of Lord
Nityananda, to his home, but a priest named Guparpava Misra did not receive him
well, and Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami’s brother, not recognizing the glories of Lord
Nityananda, also took sides with the priest. Therefore Ramadasa became sorry,
broke his flute and went away. This was a great disaster for the brother of Krsnadasa
Kaviraja Gosvami. But on that very night Lord Nityananda Prabhu Himself graced
Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami in a dream and ordered him to leave on the next day
for Vrndavana.

in potency between Krsna and Balarama. The only difference is in Their bodily
structure. As the first expansion of Godhead, Balarama is the chief Deity among
the first quadruple forms, and He is the foremost assistant of Sri- Krsna in His
transcendental activities.

TRANSLATION

He executes the orders of Lord Krspa in the work of creation, and in the form of

Lord $Sesa He serves Krsna in various ways.
PURPORT

According to expert opinion, Balarama, as the chief of the original quadruple
forms, is also the original Safkarsapa. Balarama, the first expansion of Krsna,
expands Himself in five forms: (1) Maha-Safkarsapa, (2) Karanabdhisayt, (3)
GarbhodakasayT, (4) KsirodakasayT, and (5) Sesa. These five plenary portions are
responsible for both the spiritual and material cosmic manifestations. in these five
forms Lord Balarama assists Lord Krsna in His activities. The first four of these
forms are responsible for the cosmic manifestations, whereas Sesa is responsible for
personal service to the Lord. Sesa is called Ananta, or unlimited, because He assists
the Personality of Godhead in His unlimited expansions by performing an unlimited
variety of services. Sri Balarama is the servitor Godhead who serves Lord Krsna in
all affairs of existence and knowledge. Lord Nityananda Prabhu, who is the same
servitor Godhead, Balarama, performs the same service to Lord Gauranga by
constant association.

TRANSLATION
Beyond the material nature lies the realm known as paravyoma, the spiritual sky.
Like Lord Krsna Himself, it possesses all transcendental attributes, such as the six
opulences.
PURPORT
According to Sankhya philosophy, the material cosmos is composed of twenty-
four elements: the five gross material elements, the three subtle material elements,
the five knowledge-acquiring senses, the five active senses, the five objects of sense
pleasure, and the mahat-tattva (the total material energy). Empiric philosophers,
unable to go beyond these elements, speculate that anything beyond them must be
avyakta, or inexplicable. But the world beyond the twenty-four elements is not
inexplicable, for it is explained in Bhagavad-gita as the eternal (sanatana) nature.
Beyond the manifested and unmanifested existence of material nature (vyaktavyakta)
is the sandtana nature, which is called the paravyoma, or the spiritual sky. Since
that nature is spiritual in quality, there are no qualitative differences there; every-
thing there is spiritual, everything is good, and everything possesses the spiritual
form of $ri Krsna Himself. That spiritual sky is the manifested internal potency of
Sri Krsna; it is distinct from the material sky manifested by His external potency.
The all-pervading Brahman, the impersonal glowing ray of $ri Krsna, exists in the
spiritual world with the Vaikuntha planets. We can get some idea of that spiritual
sky by a comparison to the material sky, for the rays of the sun in the material sky
can be compared to the brahmajyoti, the glowing ray of the Personality of Godhead.
In the brahmajyoti there are unlimited Vaikuntha planets, which are spiritual and
therefore self-luminous, with a glow many times greater than that of the sun. The
Personality of Godhead Sri Krsna, His innumerable plenary portions and the portions
of His plenary portions dominate each Vaikuntha planet. In the highest region of


--- Page 379 ---
380 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta
the spiritual sky is the planet called Krspaloka, which has three divisions, namely
Dvaraka, Mathura and Goloka.

To a gross materialist this kingdom of God, Vaikuntha, is certainly a mystery.
But to an ignorant man everything is a mystery for want of sufficient knowledge.
The kingdom of God is not a myth. Even the material planets, which float over our
heads in the millions and billions, are still a mystery to the ignorant. Material
scientists are now attempting to penetrate this mystery, and a day may come
when the people of this earth will be able to travel in outer space and see the
variegatedness of these millions of planets with their own eyes. In every planet
there is as much material variegatedness as we find in our own planet.

This planet earth is but an insignificant spot in the cosmic structure. Yet foolish
men, puffed up by a false sense of scientific advancement, have concentrated their
energy in a pursuit of so-called economic development on this planet, not knowing
of the variegated economic facilities available on other planets. According to modern
astronomy, the gravity of the moon is different from that of earth. Therefore if one
goes to the moon he will be able to pick up large weights and jump vast distances.
In the Ramdyana, Hanuman is described as being able to lift huge weights as heavy
as hills and jump over the ocean. Modern astronomy has confirmed that this is
indeed possible.

The disease of the modern civilized man is his disbelief of everything in the
revealed scriptures. Faithless nonbelievers cannot make progress in spiritual reali-
zation, for they cannot understand the spiritual potency. The small fruit of a
banyan contains hundreds of seeds, and in each seed is the potency to produce
another banyan tree with the potency to produce millions more of such fruits.
This law of nature is visible 06618 us, although how it works is beyond our under-
standing. This is but an insignificant example of the potency of Godhead; there are
many similar phenomena that no scientist can explain.

Everything, in fact, is inconceivable, for the truth is revealed only to the proper
persons. Although there are varieties of personalities, from Brahma down to the
insignificant ant, all of whom are living beings, their development of knowledge is
different. Therefore we have to gather knowledge from the right source. Indeed, we
can get knowledge in reality only from the Vedic sources. The four Vedas, with
their supplementary Puranas, the Mahabharata, the Ramayana and their corollaries,
which are known as smytis, are all authorized sources of knowledge. If we are at all
to gather knowledge, we must gather it from these sources without hesitation.

Revealed knowledge may in the beginning be unbelievable because of our para-
doxical desire to verify everything with our tiny brains, but the speculative means
of attaining knowledge is always imperfect. The perfect knowledge propounded in
the revealed scriptures is confirmed by the great dcdryas, who have left ample
commentations upon them; none of these dcdryas has disbelieved in the $astras.
One who disbelieves in the $dstras is an atheist, and we should not consult an
atheist, however great he may be. A staunch believer in the $astras, with all their
diversities, is the right person from whom to gather real knowledge. Such knowledge
may seem inconceivable in the beginning, but when put forward by the proper
authority its meaning is revealed, and then one no longer has any doubts about it.

PURPORT
Srila Jiva Gosvami, the great authority and philosopher in the line of $ri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu, has discussed the abode of Krsna in his Krsna-sandarbha. \n Bhagavad-
gita the Lord refers to “My abode.” Srila Jiva Gosvami, examining the nature of
Krsna’s abode, refers to the Skanda Purana, which states:
ya yatha bhuvi vartante
puryo bhagavatah priyah
tas tatha santi vaikunthe
tat-tal-Iilartham adrtah
“The abodes of Godhead in the material world, such as Dvaraka, Mathura and
Goloka, are facsimiles representing the abodes of Godhead in the kingdom of God,
Vaikuntha-dhama.”” The unlimited spiritual atmosphere of that Vaikuntha-dhama
is far above and beyond the material cosmos. This is confirmed in the Sv@yambhuva-
tantra in adiscussion between Lord Siva and ParvatT regarding the effect of chanting
the mantra of fourteen syllables. There it is stated:


--- Page 382 ---
Adi-lila, Chapter 5 383
nand-kalpa-latakirnam
vaikuntharh vyapakarh smaret
adhah samyari gupanarh ca
prakrtif sarva-karapam
“While chanting the mantra, one should always remember the spiritual world,
which is very extensive and full of desire trees that can yield anything one desires.
Below that Vaikuntha region is the potential material energy, which causes the
material manifestation.” The places of the pastimes of Lord Krsna, such as Dvaraka,
Mathura and ৬1170343173, eternally and independently exist in Krsnaloka. They are
the actual abode of Lord Krsna, and there is no doubt that they are situated above
the material cosmic manifestation.

The abode known as Vrndavana or Gokula is also known as Goloka. The Brahma-
sarihitd describes that Gokula, the highest region of the kingdom of God, resembles
a lotus flower with thousands of petals. The outer portion of that lotus-like planet
is a square place known as Svetadvipa. In the inner portion of Gokula there is an
elaborate arrangement for 511 Krsna’s residence with His eternal associates such as
Nanda and 38003. That transcendental abode exists by the energy of 5 Baladeva,
who is the original whole of Sesa, or Ananta. The tantras also confirm this description
by stating that the abode of 517 Anantadeva, the plenary portion of Baladeva, is called
the kingdom of God. Vrndavana-dhima is the innermost abode within the quadrangu-
lar realm of Svetadvipa, which lies outside of the boundary of Gokula Vrndavana.

According to Jiva Gosvami, Vaikuntha is also called Brahmaloka. The Narada-
panicardtra, in a statement concerning the mystery of Vijaya, describes:

tat sarvopari goloke
tatra lokopari svayam
viharet paramanandr
govindo ‘tula-nayakah
“The predominator of the gopis, Govinda, the principal Deity of Gokula, always
enjoys Himself in a place called Goloka in the topmost part of the spiritual sky.”

From the authoritative evidence cited by Jiva Gosvami we may conclude that
Krsnaloka is the supreme planet in the spiritual sky, which is far beyond the material
cosmos. For the enjoyment of transcendental variety, the pastimes of Krsna there
have three divisions, and these pastimes are performed in the three abodes Dvaraka,
Mathura and Gokula. When Krsnadescends to this universe, He enjoys the pastimes
in places of the same name. These places on earth are nondifferent from those
original abodes, for they are facsimiles of those original holy places in the transcen-
dental world. They are as good as $rT Krsna Himself and are equally worshipable.
Lord Caitanya declared that Lord Krsna, who presents Himself as the son of the
King of Vraja, is worshipable, and Vyndivana-dhiama is equally worshipable.

The above-mentioned dhdmas are movable, by the omnipotent will of Lord

dhamas appear, without changing their original structure. One should not discrimi-
nate between the dhamas on the earth and those in the spiritual sky, thinking those
on earth to be material and the original abodes to be spiritual. All of them are
spiritual. Only for us, who cannot experience anything beyond matter in our
present conditioned state, do the dhdmas and the Lord Himself, in His arca form,
appear before us resembling matter to give us the facility to see spirit with material
eyes. In the beginning this may be difficult for a neophyte to understand, but in
due course, when one is advanced in devotional service, it will be easier, and he will
appreciate the Lord's presence in these tangible forms.

By the grace of the Lord His dhdmas and He Himself can all be present simulta-
neously, without losing their original importance. Only when one fully develops in
affection and love of Godhead can one see those dhamas in their original appearance.

Srila Narottama dasa Thakura, a great dgcarya in the preceptorial line of Lord Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu, has said for our benefit that one can perfectly see the dhamas
only when one completely gives up the mentality of lording it over material nature.
One's spiritual vision develops proportionately to one’s giving up the debased
mentality of unnecessarily enjoying matter. A diseased person who has become
diseased because of a certain bad habit must be ready to follow the advice of the
physician, and as a natural sequence he must attempt to give up the cause of the
disease. The patient cannot indulge in the bad habit and at the same time expect
to be cured by the physician. Modern material civilization, however, is maintaining
a diseased atmosphere. The living being is a spiritual spark, as spiritual as the Lord
Himself. The only difference is that the Lord is great and the living being is small.
Qualitatively they are one, but quantitatively they are different. Therefore, since
the living being is spiritual in constitution, he can be happy only in the spiritual
sky, where there are unlimited spiritual spheres called Vaikunthas. A spiritual
being conditioned by a material body must therefore try to get rid of his disease
instead of developing the cause of the disease.

Foolish persons engrossed in their material assets are unnecessarily proud of being
leaders of the people, but they ignore the spiritual value of man. Such illusioned
leaders make plans covering any number of years, but they can hardly make
humanity happy in a state conditioned by threefold miseries inflicted by material
nature. One cannot control the laws of nature by any amount of struggling. One
must at last be subject to death, nature’s ultimate law. Death, birth, old age and
illness are symptoms of the diseased condition of the living being. The highest aim
of human life should therefore be to get free from these miseries and go back home,
back to Godhead.

PURPORT

This is a verse from Brahma-sarhhita (5.29). This description of the abode of
Krsna gives us definite information of the transcendental place where not only is
life eternal, blissful and full of knowledge, but there are ample vegetables, milk,
jewels, and beautiful homes and gardens tended by lovely damsels who are all
goddesses of fortune. Krsnaloka is the topmost planet in the spiritual sky, and below
it are innumerable spheres, a description of which can be found in Srimad-
Bhagavatam. In the beginning of Lord Brahma’s self-realization he was shown a
transcendental vision of the Vaikuntha spheres by the grace of Narayana. Later, by
the grace of Krsna, he was shown a transcendental vision of Krsnaloka. This
transcendental vision is like the reception of television from the moon via a me-
chanical system for receiving modulated waves, but it is achieved by penance and
meditation within oneself.

The Srimad-Bhagavatam (Second Canto) states that in Vaikunthaloka the material
modes of nature, represented by the qualities of goodness, passion and ignorance,
have no influence. In the material world the highest qualitative manifestation is
goodness, which is characterized by truthfulness, mental equilibrium, cleanliness,
control of the senses, simplicity, essential ‘knowledge, faith in God, scientific knowl-


--- Page 386 ---
Adi-fila, Chapter 5 387
edge and so on. Nevertheless, all these qualities are mixed with passion and imper-
fection. But the qualities in Vaikuntha are a manifestation of God’s internal potency,
and therefore they are purely spiritual and transcendental, with no trace of material
infection. No material planet, even Satyaloka, is comparable in quality to the spiritual
planets, where the five inherent qualities of the material world—namely, ignorance,
misery, egoism, anger and envy—are completely absent.

In the material world, everything is a creation. Anything we can think of within
ourexperience, including even our own bodies and minds, was created. This process
of creation began with the life of Brahma, and the creative principle is prevalent all
over the material universe because of the quality of passion. But since the quality
of passion is conspicuous by its absence in the Vaikuntha planets, nothing there is
created; everything there is eternally existent. And because there is no mode of
ignorance, there is also no question of annihilation or destruction. In the material
world one may try to make everything permanent by developing the above-
mentioned qualities of goodness, but because the goodness in the material world
is mixed with passion and ignorance, nothing here can exist permanently, despite
all the good plans of the best scientific brains. Therefore in the material world we
have no experience of eternity, bliss and fullness of knowledge. But in the spiritual
world, because of the complete absence of the qualitative modes, everything is
eternal, blissful and cognizant. Everything can speak, everything can move, every-
thing can hear, and everything can see in fully blessed existence for eternity. The
situation being so, naturally space and time, in the forms of past, present and future,
have no influence there. In the spiritual sky there is no change because time has no
influence. Consequently, the influence of mdya, the total external energy, which
induces us to become more and more materialistic and forget our relationship with
God, is also absent there.

As spiritual sparks of the beams emanating from the transcendental body of the
Lord, we are all permanently related with Him and equal to Him in quality. The
material energy is a covering of the spiritual spark, but in the absence of that
material covering, the living beings in Vaikunthaloka are never forgetful of their
identities; they are eternally cognizant of their relationship with God in their
constitutional position of rendering transcendental loving service to the Lord. Be-
cause they constantly engage in the transcendental service of the Lord, it is natural
to conclude that their senses are also transcendental, for one cannot serve the Lord
with material senses. The inhabitants of Vaikunthaloka do not possess material
senses with which to lord it over material nature.

Persons with a poor fund of knowledge conclude that a place void of material
qualities must be some sort of formless nothingness. In reality, however, there are
qualities in the spiritual world, but they are different from the material qualities
because. everything there is eternal, unlimited and pure. The atmosphere there is
self-illuminating, and thus there is no need of a sun, a moon or fire, electricity and
50 017. 0176 whocan reach that abode does not come back to the material world with
a material body. There is no difference between atheists and the faithful in the
Vaikuntha planets because all who settle there are freed from the material qualities,
and thus suras and asuras become equally obedient loving servitors of the Lord.

388 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta

The residents of Vaikuntha have brilliantly black complexions much more
fascinating and attractive than the dull white and black complexions found in the
material world. Their bodies, being spiritual, have no equals in the material world.
The beauty of a bright cloud when lightning flashes on it merely hints at their
beauty. Generally the inhabitants of Vaikuntha dress in yellow clothing. Their
bodies are delicate and attractively built, and their eyes are like the petals of lotus
flowers. Like Lord Visnu, the residents of Vaikuntha have four hands, decorated
with a conchshell, wheel, club and lotus flower. Their chests are beautifully broad
and fully decorated with necklaces of a brilliant diamond-like metal surrounded by
costly jewels never to be found in the material world. The residents of Vaikuntha
are always powerful and effulgent. Some of them have complexions like red coral
cat’s eyes and lotus flowers, and each of them has earrings of costly jewels. On
their heads they wear flowery crowns resembling garlands.

In the Vaikunthas there are airplanes, but they make no tumultuous sounds.
Material airplanes are not at all safe; they can fall down and crash at any time, for
matter is imperfect in every respect. In the spiritual sky, however, the airplanes are
also spiritual, and they are spiritually brilliant and bright. These airplanes do not
fly business executives, politicians or planning commissions as passengers, nor do
they carry cargo or postal bags, for these are all unknown there. These planes are
for pleasure trips only, and the residents of Vaikuntha fly in them with their heavenly
beautiful fairylike consorts. Therefore these airplanes, full of residents of Vaikuntha,
both male and female, increase the beauty of the spiritual sky. We cannot imagine
how beautiful they are, but their beauty may be compared to the clouds in the sky
accompanied by silver branches of electric lightning. The spiritual sky of Vaikuntha-
loka is always decorated in this way.

The full opulence of the internal potency of Godhead is always resplendent in
the Vaikunthaloka, where goddesses of fortune are ever-increasingly attached to
serving the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead. These goddesses of fortune,
accompanied by their friends, always create a festive atmosphere of transcendental
mirth. Always singing the glories of the Lord, they are not silent even for a moment.

There are unlimited Vaikuntha planets in the spiritual sky, and the ratio of these
planets to the material planets in the material sky is three to one. Thus the poor
materialist is busy making political adjustments on a planet that is most insignificant
in ০০05 creation. To say nothing of this planet earth, the whole universe, with innu-
merable planets throughout the galaxies, is comparable to a single mustard seed in a
bag full of mustard seeds. But the poor materialist makes plans to live comfortably
here and thus wastes his valuable human energy in something that is doomed to
frustration. Instead of wasting his time with business speculations, he might have
sought the life of plain living and high spiritual thinking and thus saved himself
from perpetual materialistic unrest.

Even if a materialist wants to enjoy developed material facilities, he can transfer
himself to planets where he can experience material pleasures much more advanced
than those available on earth. The best plan is to prepare oneself to return to the
spiritual sky after leaving the body. However, if one is intent on enjoying material
facilities, one can transfer himself to other planets in the material sky by utilizing


--- Page 388 ---
Adi-lila, Chapter 5 389
yogic powers. The playful spaceships of the astronauts are but childish entertain-
ments and are of no use for this purpose. The astarnga-yoga system is a materialistic
art of controlling air by transferring it from the stomach to the navel, from the
navel to the heart, from the heart to the collarbone and from there to the eyeballs,
from there to the cerebellum and from there to any desired planet. The velocities
of air and light are taken into consideration by the material scientist, but he has no
information of the velocity of the mind and intelligence. We have some limited
experience of the velocity of the mind because in a moment we can transfer our
minds to places hundreds of thousands of miles away. Intelligence is even finer.
Finer than intelligence is the soul, which is not matter like mind and intelligence
but is spirit or anti-matter. The soul is hundreds of thousands of times finer and
more powerful than intelligence. We can thus only imagine the velocity of the soul
in its traveling from one planet to another. Needless to say, the soul travels by its
own strength and not with the help of any kind of material vehicle.

The bestial civilization of eating, sleeping, fearing and sense-gratifying has misled
modern man into forgetting how powerful a soul he has. As we have already
described, the soul is a spiritual spark many, many times more illuminating, dazzling
and powerful than the sun, moon, or electricity. Human life is spoiled when man
does not realize his real identity with his soul. Lord Caitanya appeared with Lord
Nityananda to save man from this type of misleading civilization.

Sinmct Bhagovatom also describes how yogis can travel to all the planets in the
universe. When the vital force is lifted to the cerebellum, there is every chance that
this force will burst out from the eyes, nose, ears, etc., as these are places that are
known as the seventh orbit of the vital force. But the yogis can block these holes
by complete suspension of air. The yogi then concentrates the vital force in the
middle position, that is, between the eyebrows. At this position, the ০91 can think
of the planet into which he wants to enter after leaving the body. He can then
decide whether he wants to go to the abode of Krsna in the transcendental
Vaikunthas, from which he will not be required to descend into the material world,
or to travel to higher planets in the material universe. The perfect yogr is at liberty
to do either.

For the perfect yogi who has attained success in the method of leaving his body
in perfect consciousness, transferring from one planet to another is as easy as an
ordinary man’s walking to the grocery store. As already discussed, the material body
is just a covering of the spiritual soul. Mind and intelligence are the undercoverings,
and the gross body of earth, water, air and so on is the overcoating of the soul. As
such, any advanced soul who has realized himself by the yogic process, who knows
the relationship between matter and spirit, can leave the gross dress of the soul in
perfect order and as he desires. By the grace of God, we have complete freedom.
Because the Lord is kind to us, we can live anywhere—either in the spiritual sky or
in the material sky, upon whichever planet we desire. However, misuse of this free-
dom causes one to fall down into the material world and suffer the threefold
miseries of conditioned life. The living of a miserable life in the material world by
dint of the soul’s choice is nicely illustrated by Milton in Paradise Lost. Similarly,
by choice the soul can regain paradise and return home, back to Godhead.


--- Page 389 ---
390 ज Caitanya-caritamrta

At the critical time of death, one can place the vital force between the two
eyebrows and decide where he wants to go. If he is reluctant to maintain any
connection with the material world, he can, in less than a second, reach the
transcendental Vaikuntha and appear there completely in his spiritual body, which
will be suitable for him in the spiritual atmosphere. He has simply to desire to leave
the material world both in finer and in grosser forms and then move the vital force
to the topmost part of the skull and leave the body from the hole in the skull
called the brahma-randhra. This is easy for one perfect in the practice of yoga.

Of course man is endowed with free will, and as such if he does not want to free
himself of the material world he may enjoy the life of brahma-pada (occupation of
the post of Brahma) and visit Siddhaloka, the planets of materially perfect beings
who have full capacities to control gravity, space and time. To visit these higher
planets in the material universe, one need not give up his mind and intelligence
(finer matter), but need only give up grosser matter (the material body).

Each and every planet has its particular atmosphere, and if one wants to travel
to any particular planet within the material universe, one has to adapt his material
body to the climatic condition of that planet. For instance, if one wants to go from
India to Europe, where the climatic condition is different, one has to change his
dress accordingly. Similarly, a complete change of body is necessary if one wants to
go to the transcendental planets of Vaikuntha. However, if one wants to go to the
higher material planets, he can keep his finer dress of mind, intelligence and ego,
but has to leave his gross dress (body) made of earth, water, fire, etc.

When one goes to a transcendental planet, it is necessary to change both the finer
and gross bodies, for one has to reach the spiritual sky completely in a spiritual
form. This change of dress will take place automatically at the time of death if one
so desires.

Bhagavad-gita confirms that one can attain his next material body according to
his desires at the time he leaves his body. The desire of the mind carries the soul
in a suitable atmosphere as the wind carries aromas from one place to another.
Unfortunately those who are not yogis but gross materialists, who throughout their
lives indulge in sense gratification, are puzzled by the disarrangement of the bodily
and mental condition at the time of death. Such gross sensualists, encumbered by
the main ideas, desires and associations of the lives they have led, desire something
against their interest and thus foolishly take on new bodies that perpetuate their
material miseries.

Systematic training of the mind and intelligence is therefore needed so that at the
time of death one may consciously desire a suitable body, either on this planet or
another material planet or even a transcendental planet. A civilization that does not
consider the progressive advancement of the immortal soul merely fosters a bestial
life of ignorance.

It is foolish to think that every soul that passes away goes to the same place.
Either the soul goes to a place he desires at the time of death, or upon leaving his
body he is forced to accept a position according to his acts in his previous life. The
difference between the materialist and the yogris that a materialist cannot determine
his next body, whereas a yogi can consciously attain a suitable body for enjoyment


--- Page 390 ---
Adi-lila, Chapter 5 391
in the higher planets. Throughout his life, the gross materialist who is constantly
after sense gratification spends all day earning his livelihood to maintain his family,
and at night he wastes his energy in sex enjoyment or else goes to sleep thinking
about all he has done in the daytime. That is the monotonous life of the materialist.
Although differently graded as businessmen, lawyers, politicians, professors, judges,
coolies, pickpockets, laborers and so on, materialists all simply engage in eating,
sleeping, fearing and sense gratification and thus spoil their valuable lives pursuing
luxury and neglecting to perfect their lives through spiritual realization.

Yogis, however, try to perfect their lives, and therefore Bhagavad-gita enjoins
that everyone should become a yogi. Yoga is the system for linking the soul in the
service of the Lord. Only under superior guidance can one practice such yoga in his
life without changing his social position. As already described, a yogr can go anywhere
he desires without mechanical help, for a yogi can place his mind and intelligence
within the air circulating inside his body,and by practicing the art of breath control
he can mix that air with the air that blows all over the universe outside his body.
With the help of this universal air, a yog7 can travel to any planet and get a body
suitable for its atmosphere. We can understand this process by comparing it to the
electronic transmission of radio messages. With radio transmitters, sound waves
produced at a certain station can travel all over the earth in seconds. But sound is
produced from the ethereal sky, and as already explained, subtler than the ethereal
sky is the mind, and finer than the mind is the intelligence. Spirit is still finer than
the intelligence, and by nature it is completely different from matter. Thus we can
justimagine how quickly the spirit soul can travel through the universal atmosphere.

To come to the stage of manipulating finer elements like mind, intelligence and
spirit, one needs appropriate training, an appropriate mode of life and appropriate
association. Such training depends upon sincere prayers, devotional service, achieve-
ment of success in mystic perfection, and the successful merging of oneself in the
activities of the soul and Supersoul. A gross materialist, whether he be an empiric
philosopher, a scientist, a psychologist or whatever, cannot attain such success
through blunt efforts and word jugglery.

Materialists who perform yajfias, or great sacrifices, are comparatively better than
grosser materialists who do not know anything beyond laboratories and test tubes.
The advanced materialists who perform such sacrifices can reach the planet called
Vaié¢vanara, a fiery planet similar to the sun. On this planet, which is situated on the
way to Brahmaloka, the topmost planet in the universe,such an advanced materialist
can free himself from all traces of vice and its effects. When such a materialist is
purified, he can rise to the orbit of the pole star (Dhruvaloka). Within this orbit,
which is called the Sisumara cakra, are situated the Aditya-lokas and the Vaikuptha
planet within this universe.

A purified materialist who has performed many sacrifices, undergone severe
penances and given the major portion of his wealth in charity can reach such
planets as Dhruvaloka, and if he becomes still more qualified there, he can penetrate
still higher orbits and pass through the navel of the universe to reach the planet
Maharloka, where sages like Bhrgu Muni live. In Maharloka one can live even to the
time of the partial annihilation of the universe. This annihilation begins when


--- Page 391 ---
392 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta

Anantadeva, from the lowest position in the universe, produces a great blazing fire.
The heat of this fire reaches even Maharloka, and then the residents of Maharloka
travel to Brahmaloka, which exists for twice the duration of pardrdha time.

In Brahmaloka there is an unlimited number of airplanes that are controlled not
by yantra (machine) but mantra (psychic action). Because of the existence of the
mind and intelligence on Brahmaloka, its residents have feelings of happiness and
distress, but there is no cause of lamentation from old age, death, fear or distress.
They feel sympathy, however, for the suffering living beings who are consumed in
the fire of annihilation. The residents of Brahmaloka do not have gross material
bodies to change at death, but they transform their subtle bodies into spiritual
bodies and thus enter the spiritual sky. The residents of Brahmaloka can attain
perfection in three different ways. Virtuous persons who reach Brahmaloka by dint
of their pious work become masters of various planets after the resurrection of
Brahma, those who have worshiped Garbhodakasayi Visnu are liberated with Brahma,
and those who are pure devotees of the Personality of Godhead at once push through
the covering of the universe and enter the spiritual sky.

The numberless universes exist together in foamlike clusters, and so only some of
them are surrounded by the water of the Causal Ocean. When agitated by the
glance of Karanodakasayt Visnu, material nature produces the total elements, which
are eight in number and which gradually evolve from finer to gross. A part of ego is
the sky, a part of which is air, a part of which is fire, a part of which is water, a part
of which is earth. Thus one universe inflates to an area of four billion miles in
diameter. A yogi who desires gradual liberation must penetrate all the different
coverings of the universe, including the subtle coverings of the three qualitative
modes of material nature. One who does this never has to return to this mortal
world.

According to Sukadeva Gosvami, the above description of the material and
spiritual skies is neither imaginary nor utopian. The actual facts are recorded in the
Vedic hymns, and Lord Vasudeva disclosed them to Lord Brahma when Brahma
satisfied Him. One can achieve the perfection of life only when he has a definite idea
of Vaikuptha and the Supreme Godhead. One should always think about and
describe the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for this is recommended both in
Bhagavad-gita and in the Bhdgavata Purana, which are two authorized commentaries
upon the Vedas. Lord Caitanya has made all these subject matters easier for the
fallen people of this age to accept, and Sef Caitanya-caritamyrta has therefore pre-
sented them for the easy understanding of all concerned.

--- Page 394 ---
Adi-lila, Chapter 5 395
PURPORT

In the Ramanuja and Madhva sects of Vaisnpavism there are extensive descriptions
of the sri, bhi and nild energies. In Bengal the nila energy is sometimes called the
Ila energy. These three energies are employed in the service of four-handed Narayana
in Vaikuptha. Relating how three of the Alvaras, namely Bhita-yogi, Sara-yogi and
Bhranta-yogi, saw Narayana in person when they took shelter at the house of a
brahmana in the village of Gehali, the Prapannamrta of the Sri-sampradaya describes
Nardyapa as follows:

tarksyadhiradharn tadid-ambudabhari
laksmi-dharar vaksasi pankajaksam
hasta-dvaye Sobhita-Sarikha-cakrari
visnuri dadr$ur bhagavantam adyam
ajanu-bahurin kamaniya-gatrari
parsva-dvaye Sobhita-bhami-nilam
pitambarar bhisana-bhasitangari
catur-bhujari candana-rusitarigam
“They saw the lotus-eyed Lord Visnu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, mounted
on Garuda and holding Laksmi, the goddess of fortune, to His chest. He resembled
a bluish raincloud with flashing lightning, and in two of His four hands He held a
conchshell and disc. His arms stretched down to His knees, and all His beautiful
limbs were smeared with sandalwood and decorated with glittering ornaments.
He wore yellow clothes, and by either side stood His energies Bhiimi and Nila.”

There is the following reference to the 47, 6/2 and nila energies in the Sitopanisad':
maha-laksmir ५९९4250 bhinndbhinna-rapa cetandcetanatmika. sa devi tri-vidha
bhavati—Sakty-atmana iccha-$aktih kriya-Saktih saksac-chaktir iti. iccha-Saktis tri-
vidha bhavati—s$ri-bhami-nilatmika. ‘‘Maha-Laksmi, the supreme energy of the
Lord, is experienced in different ways. It is divided into material and spiritual
potencies, and in both features it acts as the willing energy, creative energy and
the internal energy. The willing energy is again divided into three, namely $ri, bhi
and nila.”

Quoting from the revealed scriptures in his commentary on Bhagavad-grta (4.6),
Madhvacarya has stated that mother material nature, which is conceived of as the
illusory energy, Durga, has three divisions, namely §r7, bhi and nila. She is the
illusory energy for those who are weak in spiritual strength because such energies
are created energies of Lord Visnu. Although each energy has no direct relationship
with the unlimited, they are subordinate to the Lord because the Lord is the
master of all energies.

In his Bhagavat-sandarbha (verse 80) Srila Jiva Gosvami Prabhu states: “The
Padma Purana refers to the eternally auspicious abode of Godhead, which is full in
all opulences, including the energies $/7 bhi and nila. The Maha-sarnhhita, which
discusses the transcendental name and form of Godhead, also mentions Durga as


--- Page 395 ---
396 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta
the potency of Supersoul in relationship with the living entities. The internal
potency acts in relation with His personal affairs, and the material potency mani-
fests the three modes.” Quoting elsewhere from the revealed scriptures, he states
that $r7 is the energy of Godhead that maintains the cosmic manifestation, bha is
the creative energy of that cosmic creation, and 2112, Durga, is the energy that
destroys the creation. All these energies act in relation with the living beings, and
thus they are together called jiva-madya.

There are two kinds of liberated souls—those who are liberated by the favor of
the Lord and those who are liberated by their own effort. One who gets liberation
by his own effort is called an impersonalist, and he merges in the glaring effulgence
of the Lord, the brahmajyoti. But devotees of the Lord who qualify themselves for
liberation by devotional service are offered four kinds of liberation, namely sa@lokya
(status equal to that of the Lord), sémipya (constant association with the Lord),
sarsti (opulence equal to that of the Lord) and sdrapya (features like those of the
Lord).

Outside of Vaikuntha, the abode of Krsna, which is called paravyoma, is the
glaring effulgence of Krsna's bodily rays. This is called the brahmajyoti. The transcen-
dental region of that effulgence is called Siddhaloka or Brahmaloka. When imper-
sonalists achieve liberation, they merge in that Brahmaloka effulgence. This
transcendental region is undoubtedly spiritual, but it contains no manifestations
of spiritual activities or variegatedness. It is compared to the glow of the sun.
Within the sun’s glow is the sphere of the sun, where one can experience all sorts of
varieties.

PURPORT
As the powerful sun, by its glowing rays, can purify all kinds of impurities, so the
all-spiritual Personality of Godhead can purify all material qualities in a person He
attracts. Even if one is attracted by Godhead in the mode of material lust, such
attraction is converted into spiritual love of Godhead by His grace. Similarly, if one
is related to the Lord in fear and animosity, he also becomes purified by the
spiritual attraction of the Lord. Although God is great and the living entity small,
they are spiritual individuals, and therefore as soon as there is a reciprocal exchange
by the living entity’s free will, at once the great spiritual being attracts the small
living entity, thus freeing him from all material bondage. This is a verse from
Srimad-Bhagavatam (7.1.29).

is like the sunshine and Krsna Himself is like the sun.”

PURPORT

This verse is from the Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu (1.2.278) of Srila Rapa Gosvami,
who further discusses this same topic in his Laghu-bhagavatamrta (1.5.41). There he
refers to the Vispu Purana (4.15.1), where Maitreya Muni asked Parasara, in regard
to Jaya and Vijaya, how it was that Hiranyakasipu next became Ravana and enjoyed
more material happiness than the demigods but did not attain salvation, although
when he became 5400212, quarreled with Krsna and was killed, he attained salva-
tion and merged into the body of Lord Krsna. Parasara replied that Hiranyakasipu
failed to recognize Lord Nrsirmhadeva as Lord Visnu. He thought that Nrsirhhadeva
was some living entity who had acquired such opulence by various pious activities.
Being overcome by the mode of passion, he considered Lord Nrsimhadeva
an ordinary living entity, not understanding His form. Nevertheless, because
Hiranyakasipu was killed by the hands of Lord Nrsimhadeva, in his next life he
became Ravana and had proprietorship of unlimited opulence. As Ravana, with
unlimited material enjoyment, he could not accept Lord Rama as the Personality
of Godhead. Therefore even though he was killed by Rama, he did not attain
sdyujya, or oneness with the body of the Lord. In his Ravana body he was too
much attracted by Rama's wife, Janaki, and because of that attraction he was
able to see Lord Rama. But instead of accepting Lord Rama as an incarnation of
Visnu, Ravana thought Him an ordinary living being. When killed by the hands of
Rama, therefore, he got the privilege of taking birth as 614५0313, who had such
immense opulence that he could think himself a competitor to Krsna. Although
Sisupala was always envious of Krsna, he frequently uttered the name of Krsna
and always thought of the beautiful features of Krsna. Thus by constantly
thinking and chanting of Krsna, even unfavorably, he was cleansed of the con-
tamination of his sinful activities. When Sisupila was killed by the Sudar$ana cakra
of Krsna 25 an enemy, his constant remembrance of Krsna dissolved the reactionsof
his vices, and he attained salvation by becoming one with the body of the Lord.


--- Page 400 ---
Adi-fila, Chapter 5 401

From this incident one can understand that even a person who thinks of Krsna
as an enemy and is killed by Him may be liberated by becoming one with the body
of Krsna. What then must be the destination of devotees who always think
favorably of Krsna as their master or friend? These devotees must attain a situation
better than Brahmaloka, the impersonal bodily effulgence of Krsna. Devotees
cannot be situated in the impersonal Brahman effulgence, into which impersonalists
desire to merge. The devotees are placed in Vaikunthaloka or Krsnaloka.

This discussion between Maitreya Muni and Parasara Muni centered on whether
devotees come down into the material world in every millennium like Jaya and
Vijaya, who were cursed by the Kumaras to that effect. In the course of these
instructions to Maitreya about Hirapyakasipu, Ravana and 514५0312, Parasara did
not say that these demons were formerly Jaya and Vijaya. He simply described
the transmigration through three lives. It is not necessary for the Vaikuntha
associates of the Supreme Personality of ‘Godhead to come to take the roles of
His enemies in all the millenniums in which He appears. The ‘‘falldown” of Jaya
and Vijaya occurred in a particular millennium; Jaya and Vijaya do not come down
in every millennium to act as demons. To think that some associates of the Lord
fall down from Vaikuntha in every millennium to become demons is totally in-
correct.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead has all the tendencies that may be found in
the living entity, for He is the chief living entity. Therefore itis natural that some-
times Lord Visnu wants to fight. Just as He has the tendencies to create, to enjoy,
to be a friend, to accept a mother and father, and so on, He also has the tendency
to fight. Sometimes important landlords and kings keep wrestlers with whom they
practice mock fighting, and Visnu makes similar arrangements. The demons who
fight with the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the material world are sometimes
His associates. When there is a scarcity of demons and the Lord wants to fight, He
instigates some of His associates of Vaikuntha to come and play as demons. When
it is said that Sisupala merged into the body of Krsna, it should be noted that in this
case he was not Jaya or Vijaya; he was actually a demon.

In his Brhad-bhagavatamrta, Srila Sanatana Gosvami has explained that the attain-
ment of salvation by merging into the Brahman effulgence of the Lord cannot be
accepted as the highest success in life, because demons like |< गऽ, who were famous
for killing brahmanpas and cows, attained that salvation. For devotees such salvation
isabominable. Devotees are actually in a transcendental position, whereas nondevo-
tees are candidates for hellish conditions of life. There is always a difference between
the life of a devotee and the life of a demon, and their realizations are as different
as heaven and hell.

Demons are always accustomed to be malicious toward devotees and to kill
brahmanas and cows. For demons, merging in the Brahman effulgence may be very
glorious, but for devotees it is hellish. A devotee’s aim in life is to attain perfection
in loving the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Those who aspire to merge into the
Brahman effulgence are as abominable as demons. Devotees who aspire to associate
with the Supreme Lord to render Him transcendental loving service are far superior.

PURPORT
Tamah means darkness. The material world is dark, and beyond the material
world is light. In other words, after passing through the entire material atmosphere,
one can come to the luminous spiritual sky, whose impersonal effulgence is known
as Siddhaloka. Mayavadi philosophers who aspire to merge with the body of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, as well as demoniac persons such as Karhsa and
Sisupala who are killed by Krsna, enter that Brahman effulgence. Yogis who attain
oneness through meditation according to the Patadfjali yoga system also reach
Siddhaloka. This is a verse from the Brahmanda Purana.

In that spiritual sky, on the four sides of Narayana, are the second expansions of

Within the spiritual sky is a second manifestation of the quadruple forms of
Dvaraka from the abode of Krsna. Among these forms, which are all spiritual and
immune to the material modes, Sri Baladeva is represented as Maha-Sankarsana.

404 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta

The actions in the spiritual sky are manifested by the internal potency in pure
spiritual existence. They expand in six transcendental opulences, which are all
manifestations of Maha-Sarikarsana, who is the ultimate reservoir and objective of
all living entities. Although belonging to the marginal potency known as jiva-Sakti,
the spiritual sparks known as the living entities are subjected to the conditions of
material energy. It is because these sparks are related with both the internal and
external potencies of the Lord that they are known as belonging to the marginal
potency.

In considering the quadruple forms of the absolute Personality of Godhead,
known as Vasudeva, Sarkarsanpa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha, the impersonalists,
headed by Sripad Sankaracarya, have interpreted the aphorisms of the Vedanta-
stra in a way suitable for the impersonalist school. To provide the intrinsic import
of such aphorisms, however, Srila Rapa Gosvami, the leader of the six Gosvamis of
Vrndavana, has properly replied to the impersonalists in his Laghu-bhdgavatamyta,
which is a natural commentary on the aphorisms of the Vedanta-sOtras.

The Padma Purdna, as quoted by Sila Ripa Gosvami in his Laghu-bhagavatamyta,
describes that in the spiritual sky there are four directions, corresponding to east,
west, north and south, in which Vasudeva, Sarnkarsana, Aniruddha and Pradyumna
are situated. The same forms are also situated in the material sky. The Padma
Purdna also describes a place in the spiritual sky known as Vedavati-pura where
Vasudeva resides. In the Visnuloka, which is above Satyaloka, 53171315303 resides.
Maha-Sankarsana is another name of Sankarsana. Pradyumna lives in Dvaraka-pura,
and Aniruddha lies on the eternal bed of Sega, generally known as ananta-$ayyad,
in the island called Svetadvipa in the ocean of milk.

PURPORT

Sripad Sankaracarya has misleadingly explained the quadruple from (catur-vyiha)
in his interpretation of the forty-second aphorism of the Second Khanda of Chapter
Two of the Vedanta-sttras (utpatty-asambhavat). In verses forty-one through forty-
seven of $/7 Caitanya-caritamyta, Srila Krspadasa Kavirdja Gosvami answers Sripad
Sankaracirya’s misleading objections to the personal feature of the Absolute Truth.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, is not like a material
object that can be known by experimental knowledge or sense perception. In the
Ndrada-paiicaratra this fact has been explained by Narayana Himself to Lord Siva.
But Sankaracirya, the incarnation of Siva, under the order of Narayana, his master,
had to mislead the monists, who favor ultimate extinction. In the conditioned
stage of existence, all living entities have four basic defects, of which one is the
cheating propensity. Safkaracarya has carried this cheating propensity to the ex-
treme to mislead the monists.

Actually, the quadruple forms explained in the Vedic literature cannot be under-
stood by the speculation of a conditioned soul. The quadruple forms should there-
fore be accepted just as they are described. The authority of the Vedas is such that
even if one does not understand something by his limited perception, he should
accept the Vedic injunction and not create interpretations to suit his imperfect
understanding. In his $driraka-bhasya, however, Safkaracarya has increased the mis-
understanding of the monists.

The quadruple forms have a spiritual existence that can be realized in vdsudeva-
sattva ($uddha-sattva), or unqualified goodness, which accompanies complete ab-
sorption in the understanding of Vasudeva. The quadruple forms, who are full of
the six opulences of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are the enjoyers of the
internal potency. Thinking the absolute Personality of Godhead to be poverty-
stricken or to have no potency—or, in other words, to be impotent—is simply
rascaldom. This rascaldom is the profession of the conditioned soul, and it increases
his bewilderment. One who cannot understand the distinctions between the spiri-
tual world and material world has no qualification to examine or know the situation
of the transcendental quadruple forms. In his commentaries on the Second Khanda
of the Vedanta-sitra, Chapter Two, verses 42-45, His Holiness Sripad Sankaracarya
has made a futile attempt to nullify the existence of these quadruple forms in the
spiritual world.

Sankaracirya says (verse 42) that devotees think the Supreme Personality of
Godhead Vasudeva, Sri Krsna, to be one, to be free from material qualities and to
have a transcendental body full of bliss and eternal existence. He is the ultimate
goal of the devotees, who believe that the Supreme Personality of Godhead expands
Himself into four other eternal transcendental forms—Vasudeva, Sarkarsana,
Pradyumna and Aniruddha. From Vasudeva, who is the primary expansion, come
Sankarsapa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha in that order. Another name of Vasudeva
is Paramatma, another name of 531) [८2152013 is fiva (the living entity), another name
of Pradyumna is mind, and another name of Aniruddha is aharikara (false ego).
Among these expansions, Vasudeva is considered the origin of material nature.


--- Page 405 ---
406 इं Caitanya-caritamrta
Therefore Safkaricarya says that 531 karsapa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha must be
creations of that original cause.

Great souls assert that Narayana, who is known as Paramatma, the Supersoul, is
beyond material nature, and this is in accordance with the statements of the Vedic
literature. Mayavadis also agree that Narayana can expand Himself in various forms.
Sankara says that he does not attempt to argue that portion of the devotees’ under-
standing, but he must protest the idea that Sankarsana is produced from Vasudeva,
Pradyumna is produced from Sankarsana, and Aniruddha is produced from
Pradyumna, for if Sarfikarsana is understood to represent the living entities created
from the body of Vasudeva, the living entities would have to be noneternal. The
living entities are supposed to be freed from material contamination by engaging
in prolonged temple worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, reading
Vedic literature and performing yoga and pious activities to attain the Supreme
Lord. But if the living entities had been created from material nature at a certain
point, they would be noneternal and would have no chance to be liberated and
associate with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When a cause is nullified, its
results are nullified. In the Second Chapter of Vedanta-sitra, Acarya Vedavyasa has
also refuted the conception that the living beings were ever born (01/70 sruter
nityatvac ca tabhyah). Because there is no creation for the living entities, they must
be eternal.

Sankaracarya says (verse 43) that devotees think that Pradyumna, who is con-
sidered to represent the senses, has sprung from Sankarsana, who is considered to
represent the living entities. But we cannot actually experience that a person can
produce senses. Devotees also say that from Pradyumna has sprung Aniruddha,
who is considered to represent the ego. But Saikaracarya says that unless the devotees
can show how ego and the means of knowledge can generate from a person, such an
explanation of the Vedanta-satra cannot be accepted, for no other philosophers
accept the 52/८5 in that way.

Sankaracarya also says (verse 44) that he cannot accept the devotees’ idea that
Sankarsana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha are equally as powerful as the absolute
Personality of Godhead, full in the six opulences of knowledge, wealth, strength,
fame, beauty and renunciation, and free from the flaw of generation at a certain
point. Even if They are full expansions, the flaw of generation remains. Vasudeva,
Sarikarsana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha, being distinct individual persons, cannot
be one. Therefore if They are accepted as absolute, full and equal, there would have
to be many Personalities of Godhead. But there is no need to accept that there are
many Personalities of Godhead, because acceptance of one omnipotent God is
sufficient for all purposes. The acceptance of more than one God is contradictory
to the conclusion that Lord Vasudeva, the absolute Personality of Godhead, is one
without a second. Even if we agree to accept that the quadruple forms of Godhead
are all identical, we cannot avoid the incongruous flaw of noneternity. Unless we
accept that there are some differences among the personalities, there is no meaning
to the idea that Sankarsana is an expansion of Vasudeva, Pradyumna is an expansion
of Sankarsana, and Aniruddha is an expansion of Pradyumna. There must be a
distinction between cause and effect. For example, a pot is distinct from the earth
from which itis made, and therefore we can ascertain that the earth is the cause and


--- Page 406 ---
Adi-fila, Chapter 5 407
the pot is the effect. Without such distinctions, there is no meaning to cause and
effect. Furthermore, the followers of the paficaratric principles do not accept any
differences in knowledge and qualities between Vasudeva, Sankarsana, Pradyumna
and Aniruddha. The devotees accept all these expansions to be one, but why
should they restrict oneness to these quadruple expansions? Certainly we should not
do so, for all living entities, from Brahma to the insignificant ant, are expansions of
Vasudeva, as accepted in all the Srutis and smytis.

Sankaracarya also says (verse 45) that the devotees who follow the Paficaratra
state that God's qualities and God Himself, as the owner of the qualities, are the
same. But how can the Bhdgavata school state that the six opulences—wisdom,
wealth, strength, fame, beauty and renunciation—are identical with Lord Vasudeva?
This is impossible.

In his Laghu-bhdgavatamrta, verses 80-83, Srila Ripa Gosvami has refuted the
charges directed against the devotees by 57030 Sankaricirya regarding their ex-
planation of the quadruple forms Vasudeva, Sahkarsana, Pradyumna and
Aniruddha. He says that these four expansions of Narayana are present in the
spiritual sky, where They are famous as Mahavastha. Among Them, Vasudeva is
worshiped within the heart by meditation because He is the predominating Deity of
the heart, as explained in Srimad-Bhagavatam (4.3.23).

Sankarsana, the second expansion, is Vasudeva’s personal expansion for pastimes,
and since He is the reservoir of all living entities, He is sometimes called jiva. The
beauty of Sarkarsana is more than that of innumerable full moons radiating light
beams. He is worshipable as the principle of ego. He has invested Anantadeva with
all the potencies of sustenance. For the dissolution of the creation, He also exhibits
Himself as the Supersoul in Rudra, irreligiosity, ahi (the snake), antaka (death) and
the demons.

Pradyumna, the third manifestation, appears from Sankarsana. Those who are
especially intelligent worship this Pradyumna expansion of Sarikarsapa as the prin-
ciple of the intelligence. The goddess of fortune always chants the glories of
Pradyumna in the place known as //dvrta-varsa, and she always serves Him with
great devotion. His complexion appears sometimes golden and sometimes bluish
like new monsoon clouds in the sky. He is the origin of the creation of the material
world, and He has invested His creative principle in Cupid. It is by His direction only
that all men and demigods and other living entities function with energy for re-
generation.

Aniruddha, the fourth of the quadruple expansions, is worshiped by great sages
and psychologists as the principle of the mind. His complexion is similar to the
bluish hue of a blue cloud. He engages in the maintenance of the cosmic manifesta-
tion and is the Supersoul of Dharma (the deity of religiosity), Manu (the pro-
genitor of mankind) and the devatds (demigods). The Moksa-dharma Vedic scripture
indicates that Pradyumna is the Deity of the total mind, whereas Aniruddha is the
Deity of the total ego, but previous statements regarding the quadruple forms are
confirmed in the Paficardtra tantras in all respects.

11 the Laghu-bhagavatamyrta, verses 44-66, there is a lucid explanation of the
inconceivable potencies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Negating
Sahkaracarya’s statements, the Mahd-vardha Purdpa declares:


--- Page 407 ---
408 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta
sarve nityah $asvatas ca
dehas tasya pardatmanah
hanopadana-rahita
naiva prakrtijah kvacit
“All the varied expansions of the Personality of Godhead are transcendental and
eternal, and all of them repeatedly descend to all the different universes of the
material creation. Their bodies, composed of eternity, bliss and knowledge, are ever-
lasting; there is no chance of their decaying, for they are not creations of the material
world. Their forms are concentrated spiritual existence, always complete with all
spiritual qualities and devoid of material contamination.”
Confirming these statements, the Ndrada-paficardtra asserts:
mapir yatha vibhagena
nila-pitadibhir yutah
rapa-bhedam avapnoti
dhyadna-bhedat tathdcyutah
“The infallible Personality of Godhead can manifest His body in different ways
according to different modes of worship, just as the vaidurya gem can manifest
itself in various colors, such as blue and yellow.” Each incarnation is distinct from
all the others. This is possible by the Lord’s inconceivable potency, by which He
can simultaneously represent Himself as one, as various partial forms and as the
origin of these partial forms. Nothing is impossible for His inconceivable potencies.
Krsna is one without a second, but He manifests Himself in different bodies, as
stated by Narada in the Tenth Canto of Srimad-Bhdgavatam:
citrarh bataitad ekena
vapusd yugapat prthak
grhesu dvy-asta-sahasrarn
striya eka uddvahat
“It is wonderful indeed that one Krsna has simultaneously become different Krsnas
in 16,000 palaces to accept 16,000 queens as His wives.” (৪৪৫9. 10.69.2) The
Padma Purdpa also explains:
sa devo bahudhad bhatva
nirgunah purusottamah
ekibhaya punah Sete
nirdoso harir adikrt
““The same Personality of Godhead, Purugottama, the original person, who is always
devoid of material qualities and contamination, can exhibit Himself in various forms
and at the same time lie down in one form.”


--- Page 408 ---
Adi-fila, Chapter 5 409

In the Tenth Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam it is said, yajanti tvan-mayas tvarm vai
bahu-marty-eka-mirtikam: *‘O my Lord, although You manifest Yourself in varieties
of forms, You are one without a second. Therefore pure devotees concentrate upon
You and worship only You.” (Bhag. 10.40.7) In the Karma Purdna it is said:

asthalas cananus caiva
sthailo ‘nus caiva sarvatah
avarnah sarvatah proktah
$yamo raktanta-locanah
“The Lord is personal although impersonal, He is atomic although great, and He is
blackish and has red eyes although He is colorless.”” By material calculation all this
may appear contradictory, but if we understand that the Supreme Personality of
Godhead has inconceivable potencies, we can accept these facts as eternally possible
in Him. In our present condition we cannot understand the spiritual activities and
how they occur, but although they are inconceivable in the material context, we
should not disregard such contradictory conceptions.

Although it is apparently inconceivable, it is quite possible for the Absolute to
reconcile all opposing elements. Srimad-Bhagavatam establishes this in the Sixth
Canto (6.9.34-37):

“O my Lord, Your transcendental pastimes and enjoyments all appear in-
conceivable because they are not limited by the causal and effective actions of
material thought. You can do everything without performing bodily work. The
Vedas say that the Absolute Truth has multifarious potencies and does not need to
do anything personally. My dear Lord, You are entirely devoid of material qualities.
Without anyone’s help, You can create, maintain and dissolve the entire qualitative
material manifestation, yet in all such activities You do not change. You do not
accept the results of Your activities, unlike ordinary demons and demigods, who
suffer or enjoy the reactions of their activities in the material world. Unaffected by
the reactions of work, You eternally exist with Your full spiritual potency. This we
cannot fully understand.

“Because You are unlimited in Your six opulences, no one can count Your
transcendental qualities. Philosophers and other thoughtful persons are overwhelmed
by the contradictory manifestations of the physical world and the propositions of
logical arguments and judgments. Because they are bewildered by word jugglery and
disturbed by the different calculations of the scriptures, their theories cannot touch
You, who are the ruler and controller of everyone and whose glories are beyond
conception.

“Your inconceivable potency keeps You unattached to the mundane qualities.
Surpassing all conceptions of material contemplation, Your pure transcendental
knowledge keeps You beyond all speculative processes. By Your inconceivable po-
tency, there is nothing contradictory in You.

“People may sometimes think of You as impersonal or personal, but You are one.
For persons who are confused or bewildered, a rope may manifest itself as different
kinds of snakes. For similar confused persons who are uncertain about You, You


--- Page 409 ---
410 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta
create various philosophical methods in pursuance of their uncertain positions.”

We should always remember the differences between spiritual and material actions.
The Supreme Lord, being all-spiritual, can perform any act without extraneous
help. In the material world, if we want to manufacture an earthen pot, we need the
ingredients, a machine and also a laborer. But we should not extend this idea to the
actions of the Supreme Lord, for He can create anything in a moment without that
which appears necessary in our own conception. When the Lord appears as an incar-
nation to fulfill a particular purpose, this does not indicate that He is unable to
fulfill it without appearing. He can do anything simply by His will, but by His
causeless mercy He appears to be dependent upon His devotees. He appears as the
son of Yasodamata not because He is dependent on her care but because He accepts
such a role by His causeless mercy. When He appears for the protection of His devo-
tees, He naturally accepts trials and tribulations on their behalf.

In Bhagavad-gita it is said that the Lord, being equally disposed towards every
living being, has no enemies and no friends, but He has special affection for a devo-
tee who always thinks of Him in love. Therefore neutrality and partiality are both
among the transcendental qualities of the Lord, and they are properly adjusted
by His inconceivable energy. The Lord is Parabrahman, or the source of the imper-
sonal Brahma, which is His all-pervading feature of neutrality. In His personal
feature, however, as the owner of all transcendental opulences, the Lord displays
His partiality by taking the side of His devotees. Partiality, neutrality and all such
qualities are present in God, otherwise they could not be experienced in the creation.
Since He is the total existence, all things are properly adjusted in the Absolute. in
the relative world such qualities are displayed in a perverted manner, and therefore
we experience nonduality as a perverted reflection. Because there is no logic to ex-
plain how things happen in the realm of spirit, the Lord is sometimes described as
being beyond the range of experience. But if we simply accept the Lord’s incon-
ceivability, we can then adjust all things in Him. Nondevotees cannot understand
the Lord’s inconceivable energy, and consequently for them it is said that He is
beyond the range of conceivable expression. The author of the Brahma-sitras accepts
this fact and says, Srutes tu Sabda-milatvat: the Supreme Personality of Godhead
is not conceivable by an ordinary man; He can be understood only through the
evidence of Vedic injunctions. The Skanda Purana confirms, acintydh khalu ye
bhava na ६८/75 tarkena yojayet: ‘‘Matters inconceivable to a common man should
not be a subject for argument.” We find very wonderful qualities even in material
jewels and drugs. Indeed, their qualities often appear inconceivable. Therefore if we
do not attribute inconceivable potencies to the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
we cannot establish His supremacy. It is because of these inconceivable potencies
that the glories of the Lord have always been accepted as difficult to understand.

Ignorance and the jugglery of words are very common in human society, but they
do not help one understand the inconceivable energies of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. If we accept such ignorance and word jugglery, we cannot accept the
Supreme Lord’s perfection in six opulences. For example, one of the opulences of
the Supreme Lord is complete knowledge. Therefore, how could ignorance be con-
ceivable in Him? Vedic instructions and sensible arguments establish that the Lord’s


--- Page 410 ---
Adi-fila, Chapter 5 411
maintaining the cosmic manifestation and simultaneously being indifferent to the
activities of its maintenance cannot be contradictory, because of His inconceivable
energies. To a person who is always absorbed in the thought of snakes, a rope al-
ways appears as a snake, and similarly to a person bewildered by material qualities
and devoid of knowledge of the Absolute, the Supreme Personality of Godhead
appears according to diverse bewildered conclusions.

Someone might argue that the Absolute would be affected by duality if He were
both all-cognizance (Brahman) and the Personality of Godhead with six opulences
in full (Bhagavan). To refute such an argument, the aphorism svarapa-dvayam
iksyate declares that in spite of appearances, there is no chance of duality in the
Absolute, for He is but one in diverse manifestations. Understanding that the
Absolute displays varied pastimes by the influence of His energies at once removes
the apparent incongruity of His inconceivably opposite energies. Srimad-Bhdgavatam
(3.4.16) gives the following description of the inconceivable potency of the Lord:

karmany anihasya bhavo ’bhavasya te
durgasrayo ‘thdri-bhayat palayanam
kalatmano yat pramada-yutasrayah
svatman-rateh khidyati dhir vidam iha
“Although the Supreme Personality of Godhead has nothing to do, He nevertheless
acts;although He is always unborn, He nevertheless takes birth; although He is time,
fearful to everyone, He flees Mathura in fear of His enemy to take shelter in a fort;
and although He is self-sufficient, He marries 16,000 women. These pastimes seem
like bewildering contradictions, even to the most intelligent.” Had these activities
of the Lord not been a reality, sages would not have been puzzled by them. There-
fore such activities should never be considered imaginary. Whenever the Lord de-
sires, His inconceivable energy (yogamdyd) serves Him in creating and performing
such pastimes.

The scriptures known as the Paficaratra-$astras are recognized Vedic scriptures
that have been accepted by the great dcdryas. These scriptures are not products of
the modes of passion and ignorance. Learned scholars and brdhmanas therefore al-
ways refer to them as sdtvata-sarinhitds. The original speaker of these scriptures is
Narayana, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is especially mentioned in the
Moksa-dharma (349.68), which is part of the Santi-parva of the Mahabharata.
Liberated sages like Narada and Vyasa, who are free from the four defects of
conditioned souls, are the propagators of these scriptures. Sri Narada Muni is the
original speaker of the Paficaratra-$dstra. Srimad-Bhagavatam is also considered a
sdtvata-sarbhita. १५९९, Sri Caitanya Mahiprabhu declared, srimad-bhagavatam
purdpam amalam: “Srimad-Bhagavatam is a spotless Purana.” Malicious editors and
scholars who attempt to misrepresent the Paficardtra-sdstras to refute its regulations
are most abominable. In the modern age, such malicious scholars have even com-
mented misleadingly upon Bhagavad-gita, which was spoken by Krsna, to prove
that there is no Krsna. How the Mayavadis have misrepresented the pdncardtrika-
vidhi will be shown below.


--- Page 411 ---
412 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta

(1) In commenting on the forty-second verse of the Veddnta-satra, Sripad
Sankaracirya has claimed that Safkarsana is /7/2, the ordinary living entity, but
there is no evidence in any Vedic scripture that devotees of the Lord have ever
said that Safkarsapa is an ordinary living entity. He is an infallible plenary expansion
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the Visnu category, and He is beyond
the creation of material nature. He is the original source of the living entities. The
Upanisads declare, nityo nitydndri cetanas cetandndm: ‘‘He is the supreme living
entity among all the living entities.” Therefore He is vibhu-caitanya, the greatest.
He is directly the cause of the cosmic manifestation and the infinitesimal living
beings. He is the infinite living entity, and ordinary living entities are infinitesimal.
Therefore He is never to be considered an ordinary living being, for that would be
against the conclusion of the authorized scriptures. The living entities are also beyond
the limitations of birth and death. This is the version of the Vedas, and it is accepted
by those who follow scriptural injunctions and who have actually descended in the
disciplic succession.

(2) In answer to Safkaracarya’s commentary on the forty-third verse, it must be
said that the original Visnu of all the Visnu categories, which are distributed in
several ways, is Mila 53171315303. Mala means ‘“‘the original.” Sarikarsana is also
Visnu, but from Him all other Visnus expand. This is confirmed in the Brahma-
sarnhitd, wherein it is said that just as a flame transferred from another flame
acts like the original, so the Vispus who emanate from Mila Sankarsana are as good
as the original Visnu. One should worship that Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Govinda, who thus expands Himself.

(3) In reply to the commentary of Sarikaricarya on the forty-fourth verse, it may
be said that no pure devotees strictly following the principles of Paficaratra will
ever accept the statement that all the expansions of Visnu are different identities,
for this idea is completely false. Even Sripad Sankaracarya, in his commentary on
the forty-second verse, has accepted that the Personality of Godhead can auto-
matically expand Himself variously. Therefore his commentary on the forty-second
verse and his commentary on the forty-fourth verse are contradictory. It is a defect
of Mayavada commentaries that they make one statement in one place and a con-
tradictory statement in another place as a tactic to refute the Bhdgavata school.
Thus Mayavadt commentators do not even follow regulative principles. It should be
noted that the Bhadgavata school accepts the quadruple forms of Narayana, but that
does not mean that it accepts many Gods. Devotees know perfectly well that the
Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is one without a second. They
are never pantheists, worshipers of many Gods, for this is against the injunction of
the Vedas. Devotees completely believe, with strong faith, that Narayana is transcen-
dental and has inconceivable proprietorship of various transcendental potencies. We
therefore recommend that scholars consult the Laghu-bhagavatamrta of Srila Rapa
Gosvami, where these ideas are explicitly stated. Sripad Sankaracarya has tried to
prove that Vasudeva, Sankarsana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha expand through

pletely ignorant, however, for there is no such thing as cause and effect in Their ex-

pansions (ndnyad yat sad-asat-param). The Kirma Purana also confirms, deha-dehi-
vibhedo ’yarh nesvare vidyate kvacit: “There is no difference between body and
soul in the Supreme Personality of Godhead.” Cause and effect are material. For
example, it is seen that a father’s body is the cause of a son’s body, but the soul
is neither cause nor effect. On the spiritual platform there are none of the differences
we find in cause and effect. Since all the forms of the Supreme Personality of God-
head are spiritually supreme, They are equally controllers of material nature. Stand-
ing on the fourth dimension, They are predominating figures on the transcendental
platform. There is no trace of material contamination in Their expansions because
material laws cannot influence Them. There is no such rule as cause and effect out-
side of the material world. Therefore the understanding of cause and effect cannot
approach the full, transcendental, complete expansions of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. The Vedic literature proves this:

orh parpam adah pérnpam (4/7
parnat parpam udacyate
phrnpasya parnam addya
parnam evavasisyate

“The Personality of Godhead is perfect and complete, and because He is completely
perfect, all emanations from Him, such as this phenomenal world, are perfectly
equipped as complete wholes. Whatever is produced of the complete whole is also
complete by itself. Because He is the complete whole, even though so many complete
units emanate from Him, He remains the complete balance.” (Brhad-dranyaka
Upanisad, 5.1) It is most apparent that nondevotees violate the rules and regulations
of devotional service to equate the whole cosmic manifestation, which is the external
feature of Visnu, with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the controller
of mdya, or with His quadruple expansions. The equalization of mdya and spirit,
or mdyd and the Lord, is a sign of atheism. The cosmic creation, which manifests
life in forms from Brahma to the ant, is the external feature of the Supreme Lord.
It comprises one fourth of the Lord’s energy, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita
(ekarhsena sthito jagat). The cosmic manifestation of the illusory energy is material
nature, and everything within material nature is made of matter. Therefore, one
should not try to compare the expansions of material nature to the catur-vyiha, the
quadruple expansions of the Personality of Godhead, but unfortunately the
Mayavadt school unreasonably attempts to do this.

(4) To answer Sanhkaricarya’s commentary on the forty-fifth verse, the substance
of the transcendental qualities and their spiritual nature is described in the Laghu-
bhagavatamrta, verses 97 through 99, as follows: “Some say that transcendence
must be void of all qualities because qualities are manifested only in matter. Accord-
ing to them, all qualities are like temporary, flickering mirages. But this is not
acceptable. Since the Supreme Personality of Godhead is absolute, His qualities are
nondifferent from Him. His form, name, qualities and everything else pertaining to
Him are as spiritual as He is. Every qualitative expansion of the absolute Personality


--- Page 413 ---
414 इ Caitanya-caritamrta

of Godhead is identical with Him. Since the Absolute Truth, the Personality of
Godhead, is the reservoir of all pleasure, all the transcendental qualities that expand
from Him are also reservoirs of pleasure. This is confirmed in the scripture known
as Brahma-tarka, which states that the Supreme Lord Hari is qualified by Himself,
and therefore Visnu and His pure devotees and their transcendental qualities cannot
be different from their persons. In the Visnu Purdpa Lord Visnu is worshiped in
the following words: ‘Let the Supreme Personality of Godhead be merciful toward
us. His existence is never infected by material qualities.’ in the same Visnu Purana
it is also said that all the qualities attributed to the Supreme Lord, such as knowledge,
opulence, beauty, strength and influence, are known to be nondifferent from Him.
This is also confirmed in the Padma Purdna, which explains that whenever the
Supreme Lord is described as having no qualities, this should be understood to indi-
cate that He is devoid of material qualities. In the First Chapter of the same Padma
Purana it is said: ‘O Dharma, protector of religious principles, all noble and sublime
qualities are eternally manifested in the person of Krsna, and devotees and transcen-
dentalists who aspire to become faithful also desire to possess such transcendental
qualities.” ” It is to be understood that Lord Sri Krsna, the transcendental form of
absolute bliss, is the fountainhead of all pleasurable transcendental qualities and
inconceivable potencies. In this connection we may recommend references to
Srimad-Bhagavatam, Third Canto, Chapter Twenty-Six, verses 21, 25, 27 and 28.

Sripad Ramanujacarya has also refuted the arguments of Sankara in his own
commentary on the Vedanta-satra, which is known as the Sri-bhdsya: “$Sripad
Sankaracarya has tried to equate the Pahcardtras with the philosophy of the
atheist Kapila, and thus he has tried to prove that the Paficardtras contradict the
Vedic injunctions. The Paficardatras state that the personality of jiva called Sarikarsana
has emerged from Vasudeva, the supreme cause of all causes, that Pradyumna, the
mind, has come from Sarikarsana, and that Aniruddha, the ego, has come from
Pradyumna. But one cannot say that the living entity (iva) takes birth or is created,
for such a statement is against the injunction of the Vedas. As stated in the Katha
Upanisad (2.18), living entities, as individual spiritual souls, can have neither birth
nor death. All Vedic literature declares that the living entities are eternal. Therefore
when it is said that Sarnikarsana is jiva, this indicates that He is the predominating
Deity of the living entities. Similarly, Pradyumna is the predominating Deity of the
mind, and Aniruddha is the predominating Deity of the ego.

“It has been said that Pradyumna, the mind, was produced from Sarkarsana. But
if ऽ गौ {८215212 were a living entity, this could not be accepted, because a living
entity cannot be the cause of the mind. The Vedic injunctions state that everything
—including life, mind and the senses—comes from the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. It is impossible for the mind to be produced by a living entity, for the
Vedas state that everything comes from the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Lord.

‘‘Sanikarsapa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha have all the potent features of the
absolute Personality of Godhead, according to the revealed scriptures, which con-
tain undeniable facts that no one can refute. Therefore these quadruple forms are
never to be considered ordinary living beings. Each of Them is a plenary expansion


--- Page 414 ---
Adi-lila, Chapter5 415
of the Absolute Godhead, and thus each is identical with the Supreme Lord in
knowledge, opulence, energy, influence, prowess and potencies. The evidence of
Paricaratra cannot be neglected. Only untrained persons who have not genuinely
studied the Paficaratras think that the Paficaratras contradict the Srutis regarding the
birth or beginning of the living entity. In this connection, we must accept the verdict
of Srimad-Bhagavatam, which says: ‘The absolute Personality of Godhead, who is
known as Vasudeva and who is very much affectionate toward His surrendered
devotees, expands Himself in quadruple forms who are subordinate to Him and at
the same time identical with Him in all respects.” The Pauskara-sarihita states: ‘The
scriptures that recommend that brdhmapas worship the quadruple forms of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead are called agamas [authorized Vedic literatures].’
In all Vaignava literature it is said that worshiping these quadruple forms is as good
as worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead Vasudeva, who in His different
expansions, complete in six opulences, can accept offerings from His devotees of the
results of their prescribed duties. Worshiping the expansions for pastimes, such as
Nrsimha, Rima, Sesa and Kiirma, promotes one to the worship of the Sankarsana
quadruple. From that position one is raised to the platform of worshiping Vasudeva,
the Supreme Brahman. In the Paugkara-sarhhita it is said: ‘If one fully worships
according to the regulative principles, one can attain the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Vasudeva. It is to be accepted that Sarikarsana, Pradyumna and
Aniruddha are as good as Lord Vasudeva, for They all have inconceivable power
and can accept transcendental forms like Vasudeva. Sarikarsana, Pradyumna and
Aniruddha are never born, but They can manifest Themselves in various incarna-
tions before the eyes of pure devotees. This is the conclusion of all Vedic literature.
That the Lord can manifest Himself before His devotees by His inconceivable power
is not against the teaching of the Paficaratra. Since Sankarsana, Pradyumna and
Aniruddha are actually the predominating Deities of all living entities, the total
mind, and the total ego, the descriptions of Sarikarsana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha
as jiva, mind and ego are never contradictory to the statements of the scriptures.
These names identify these Deities, just as the terms ‘sky’ and ‘light’ sometimes
identify the Absolute Brahman.

“The scriptures completely deny the birth or production of the living entity.
In the Parama-sarihita it is described that material nature, which is used for others’
purposes, is factually inert and always subject to transformation. The field of
material nature is the arena of the activities of fruitive actors and since the material
field is externally related with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, it is also
eternal. In every sarhhitd, the jiva (living entity) has been accepted as eternal, and
in the Pancaratra the birth of the jiva is completely denied. Anything that is pro-
duced must also be annihilated. Therefore if we accept the birth of the living entity,
we also have to accept his annihilation. But since the Vedic literatures say that the
living entity is eternal, one should not think the living being to be produced at a
certain time. In the beginning of the Parama-sarnhita it is definitely stated that the
face of material nature is constantly changeable. Therefore beginning, annihilation
and all such terms are applicable only in the material nature.


--- Page 415 ---
416 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta

“Considering all these points, one should understand that Sarikaracarya's state-
ment that Sankarsana is born as a jiva is completely against the Vedic statements.
His assertions are completely refuted by the above arguments. In this connection the
commentary of Sridhara Svami on Srimad-Bhagavatam (3.1.34) is very helpful.”

For a detailed refutation of Sankaracirya’s arguments to prove Sarkarsana an
ordinary living being, one may refer to Srimat Sudarsanicarya’s commentary on
Sri-bhasya, which is known as the Sruta-prakasika.

The original quadruple forms Krsna, Baladeva, Pradyumna and Aniruddha ex-
pand into another quadruple, which is present in the Vaikuntha planets of the
spiritual sky. Therefore the quadruple forms in the spiritual sky are the second
manifestation of the original quadruple in Dvaraka. As explained above, Vasudeva,
53171319313, Pradyumna and Aniruddha are all changeless, transcendental plenary
expansions of the Supreme Lord who have no relation to the material modes. The
Sarikarsana form in the second quadruple is not only a representation of Balarama
but 2150 the original cause of the Causal Ocean, where Karanodakasayt Visnu lies
asleep, breathing out the seeds of innumerable universes.

In the spiritual sky there is a spiritual creative energy technically called suddha-
sattva, which is a pure spiritual energy that sustains all the Vaikuntha planets with
the full opulences of knowledge, wealth, prowess, etc. All these actions of suddha-
sattva display the potencies of Maha-Sarikarsana, who is the ultimate reservoir of all
individual living entities who are suffering in the material world. When the cosmic
creation is annihilated, the living entities, who are indestructible by nature, rest
in the body of Maha-Sankarsana. Sarikarsana is therefore sometimes called the
total jiva. As spiritual sparks, the living entities have the tendency to be inactive
in the association of material energy, just as sparks of a fire have the tendency to
be extinguished as soon as they leave the fire. The spiritual nature of the living
being can be rekindled, however, in association with the Supreme Being. Because
the living being can appear either in matter or in spirit, the jiva is called the marginal
potency.

Sankarsana is the origin of Karana Visnu, who is the original form who creates the
universes, and that Sarikarsana is but a plenary expansion of তা Nityananda Rama.

Outside the Vaikuntha planets is the impersonal Brahman effulgence, and beyond

PURPORT
The impersonal glowing effulgence known as impersonal Brahman is the outer
space of the Vaikuntha planets in the spiritual sky. Beyond that impersonal
Brahman is the great Causal Ocean, which lies between the material and spiritual
skies. The material nature is a by-product of this Causal Ocean.
Karanodakasayi Visnu, who lies on the Causal Ocean, creates the universes merely
by glancing upon material nature. Therefore Krsna personally has nothing to do with


--- Page 420 ---
Adi-ila, Chapter 5 421
the material creation. Bhagavad-gita confirms that the Lord glances over material
nature, and thus she produces the many material universes. Neither Krsna in Goloka
nor Narayana in Vaikuntha comes directly in contact with the material creation.
They are completely aloof from the material energy.

It is the function of Maha-Sankarsana in the form of Karanodakasdayi Visnu to
glance over the material creation, which is situated beyond the limits of the Causal
Ocean. Material nature is connected with the Personality of Godhead by His glance
over her and nothing more. It is said that she is impregnated by the energy of His
glance. The material energy, mdyd, never even touches the Causal Ocean, for the
Lord’s glance focuses upon her from a great distance away.

The glancing power of the Lord agitates the entire cosmic energy, and thus its
actions begin at once. This indicates that matter, however powerful she may be, has
no power by herself. Her activity begins by the grace of the Lord, and then the
entire cosmic creation is manifested in a systematic way. The example of a woman’s
conception can help us understand this subject to a certain extent. The mother is
passive, but the father puts his energy within the mother, and thus she conceives.
She supplies the ingredients for the birth of the child in her womb. Similarly, the
Lord activates material nature, which then supplies the ingredients for cosmic
development.

Material nature has two different phases. The aspect called pradhana supplies the
material ingredients for cosmic development, and the aspect called maya causes the
manifestation of her ingredients, which are temporary like foam in the ocean. In
reality, the temporary manifestations of material nature are originally: caused by the
spiritual glance of the Lord. The Personality of Godhead is the direct, or remote,
cause of creation, and material nature is the indirect, or immediate, cause. Material
istic scientists, puffed-up by the magical changes their so-called inventions have
brought about, cannot see the real potency of Godhead behind matter. Therefore
the jugglery of science is gradually leading people to a godless civilization at the
cost of the goal of human life. Having missed the goal of life, materialists run after
self-sufficiency, not knowing that material nature is already self-sufficient by the
grace of God. Thus creating a colossal hoax in the name of civilization, they create
an imbalance in the natural self-sufficiency of material nature.

To think of material nature as all in all, not knowing the original cause, is
ignorance. Lord Caitanya appeared to dissipate this darkness of ignorance by
igniting the spark of spiritual life that can, by His causeless mercy, enlighten the
entire world.

To explain how mdyd acts by Krsna’s power, the author of 6/7 Caitanya-caritamyta
gives the example that an iron rod in a fire, although it is not fire, becomes red-hot
and acts like fire itself. Similarly, all the actions and reactions of material nature
are not actually the work of material nature, but are actions and reactions of the
energy of the Supreme Lord manifested through matter. The power of electricity
is transmitted through the medium of copper, but this does not mean that the
copper is electricity. The power is generated at a powerhouse under the control of
an expert living being. Similarly, behind all the jugglery of the natural laws is a
great living being, who is a person like the mechanical engineer in the powerhouse.
It is by His intelligence that the entire cosmic creation moves in a systematic way.


--- Page 421 ---
422 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta
The modes of nature that directly cause material actions are also originally
activated by Narayana. A simple example will explain how this is so. When a potter
manufactures a pot from earth, the potter's wheel, his tools and the potter himself
are the remote causes of the pot, but the potter is the chief cause. Similarly,
Narayana is the chief cause of all material creations, and the material energy supplies
the ingredients of matter. Therefore without Narayana, all other causes are useless,
just as the potter's wheel and tools are useless without the potter himself. Since
materialistic scientists ignore the Personality of Godhead, it is as if they were con-
cerned with the potter's wheel and its rotation, the potter’s tools and the ingre-
dients for the pots, but had no knowledge of the potter himself. Therefore modern
science has created an imperfect, godless civilization that is in gross ignorance of the
ultimate cause. Scientific advancement should have a great goal to attain, and that
great goal should be the Personality of Godhead. In Bhagavad-gita it is said that
after conducting research for many, many births, great men of knowledge who
stress the importance of experimental thought can know the Personality of Godhead,
who is the cause of all causes. When one knows Him perfectly, one surrenders unto
Him and then becomes a mahatma.

two parts. Mdya is the cause and the ingredient of the cosmic manifestation. As the
cause of the cosmic manifestation she is known as maya, and as the agent supplying
the ingredients of the cosmic manifestation she is known as pradhdna. An explicit
description of these divisions of external energy is given in Srimad-Bhagavatam
(11.24.1-4). Elsewhere in Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.63.26) the ingredients and cause
of the material cosmic manifestation are described as follows:

kalo daivarih karma jivah svabhavo
dravyarh ksetrarh prana atma vikdrah
tat-sanghato bija-roha-pravahas
tvan-mdyaisa tan-nisedharh prapadye
“O my Lord! Time, activity, providence and nature are four parts of the causal
aspect [mayd] of the external energy. The conditioned vital force, the subtle mate-
rial ingredients called the dravya, and material nature (which is the field of activity
where the false ego acts as the soul), as well as the eleven senses and five elements
(earth, water, fire, air and ether), which are the sixteen ingredients of the body—
these are the ingredient aspect of maya. The body is generated from activity, and
activity is generated from the body, just as a tree is generated from a seed that is
generated from a tree. This reciprocal cause and effect is called maya. My dear
Lord, You can save me from this cycle of cause and effect. | worship Your lotus
feet.”

Although the living entity is primarily related to the causal portion of maya, he
is nevertheless conducted by the ingredients of mdyd. Three forces work in the
causal portion of maya: knowledge, desire and activity. The material ingredients
are a manifestation of maya as pradhdana. In other words, when the three qualities
of mdyad are in a dormant stage, they exist as prakrti, avyakta or pradhdna. The word
avyakta, referring to the nonmanifest, is another name of pradhana. In the avyakta
stage, material nature is without varieties. Varieties are manifested by the pradhana
portion of maya. The word pradhana is therefore more important than avyakta or
prakrti.

TRANSLATION
Because prakrti is dull and inert, it cannot actually be the cause of the material
world. But Lord Krsna shows His mercy by infusing His energy into the dull, inert
material nature.

PURPORT

The external energy, composed of pradhdna or prakrti 25 the ingredient-supplying
portion and mdyd as the causal portion, is known as mdya-sakti. Inert material
nature is not the actual cause of the material manifestation, for Karanarpavasayi,
MahaVisnu, the plenary expansion of Krsna, activates all the ingredients. It is in this
way that material nature has the power to supply the ingredients. The example
given is that iron has no power to heat or’burn, but after coming in contact with fire
the iron becomes red-hot and can then diffuse heat and burn other things. Material
nature is like iron, for it has no independence to act without the touch of Visnu,
who is compared to fire. Lord Visnu activates material nature by the power of His
glance, and then the ironlike material nature becomes a material-supplying agent
just as iron made red-hot becomes a burning agent. Material nature cannot indepen-
dently become an agent for supplying the material ingredients. This is more clearly
explained by Sri. Kapiladeva, an incarnation of Godhead, in Srimad-Bhagavatam
(3.28.40):

yatholmukad visphulingad
dhiamad vapi sva-sambhavat
apy atmatvenabhimatad
yathagnih prthag ulmukat
“Although smoke, flaming wood, and sparks are all considered together as ingredients
of a fire, the flaming wood is nevertheless different from the fire, and the smoke is
different from the flaming wood.” The material elements (earth, water, fire, etc.)
are like smoke, the living entities are like sparks, and material nature as pradhdna is
like the flaming wood. But all of them together are recipients of power from the
Supreme Personality of Godhead and are thus able to manifest their individual
capacities. In. other words, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the origin of all
manifestations. Material nature can supply only when it is activated by the glance
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Just as a woman can deliver a child after being impregnated by the semina of a
man, so material nature can supply the material elements after being glanced upon
by Maha-Visnu. Therefore pradhdna cannot be independent of the superintendence
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (9.10).
Mayadhyaksena prakrtih saiyate sa-cardcaram: prakrti, the total material energy,
works under the superintendence of the Lord. The original source of the material
elements is Krsna. Therefore the attempt of the atheistic Sankhya philosophers to
consider material nature the source of these elements, forgetting Krsna, is useless,
like trying to get milk from the nipple-like bumps of skin hanging on the neck of a
goat.

PURPORT
The Vedic conclusion is that the cosmic manifestation visible to the eyes of the
conditioned soul is caused by the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead,
through the exertion of His specific energies, although in the conclusion of


--- Page 429 ---
430 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta

atheistic deliberations this manifested cosmic exhibition is attributed to material
nature. The energy of the Absolute Truth is exhibited in three ways: spiritual,
material and marginal. The Absolute Truth is identical with His spiritual energy.
Only when contacted by the spiritual energy can the material energy work and the
temporary material manifestations thus appear active. In the conditioned state the
living entities of the marginal energy are a mixture of spiritual and material energies.
The marginal energy is originally under the control of the spiritual energy, but,
under the control of the material energy, the living entities have been wandering in
forgetfulness within the material world since time immemorial.

The conditioned state is caused by misuse of the individual independence of the
spiritual platform, for this separates the living entity from the association of the
spiritual energy. But when the living entity is enlightened by the grace of the
Supreme Lord or His pure devotee and becomes inclined to revive his original state
of loving service, he is on the most auspicious platform of eternal bliss and knowl-
edge. The marginal jiva, or living entity, misuses his independence and becomes
averse to the eternal service attitude when he independently thinks he is not energy
but the energetic. This misconception of his own existence leads him to the attitude
of lording it over material nature.

Material nature appears to be just the opposite of the spiritual energy. The fact is
that the material energy can work only when in contact with the spiritual energy.
Originally the energy of Krsna is spiritual, but it works in diverse ways, like elec-
trical energy, which can exhibit the functions of refrigerating or heating through its
manifestations in different ways. The material energy is spiritual energy covered by
a cloud of illusion, or maya. Therefore, the material energy is not self-sufficient in
working. Krsna invests His spiritual energy into material energy, and then it can act,
just as iron can act like fire after being heated by fire. The material energy can act
only when empowered by the spiritual energy.

When covered by the cloud of material energy, the living entity, who is also a
spiritual energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, forgets about the activities
of the spiritual energy and considers all that happens in the material manifestation
to be wonderful. But a person who is engaged in devotional service in full Krsna
consciousness and who is therefore already situated in the spiritual energy can
understand that the material energy has no independent powers; whatever actions
are going on are due to the help of the spiritual energy. The material energy, which
is a perverted form of the spiritual energy, presents everything pervertedly, thus
causing misconceptions and duality. Material scientists and philosophers conditioned
by the spell of material nature suppose that material energy acts automatically, and
therefore they are frustrated, like an illusioned person who tries to get milk from
the nipple-like bunches of skin on the neck of a goat. As there is no possibility
of getting milk from these bunches of skin, there is similarly no possibility that
anyone will be successful |) understanding the original cause of creation by for-
warding theories produced by the material energy. Such an attempt is a manifesta-
tion of ignorance.

The material energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is called maya, or
illusion, because in two capacities (by supplying the material elements and by


--- Page 430 ---
Adi-lila, Chapter 5 431
causing the material manifestation) it makes the conditioned soul unable to under-
stand the real truth of creation. When a living entity is liberated, however, from the
conditional life of matter, he can understand the two different activities of material
nature, namely covering and bewildering.

The origin of creation is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita (9.10), the cosmic manifestation is working under the direction of
the Supreme Lord, who invests the material energy with three material qualities.
Agitated by these qualities, the elements supplied by the material energy produce
varieties of things, just as an artist produces varieties of pictures by mixing the three
colors red, yellow and blue. Yellow represents the quality of goodness, red repre-
sents passion, and blue represents ignorance. Therefore the colorful material creation
is but an interaction of these three qualities, represented in eighty-one varieties of
mixtures (3 x 3 equalling 9, 9 x 9 thus equalling 81). Deluded by material
energy, the conditioned soul, enamored by these eighty-one varieties of manifesta-
tions, wants to lord it over material energy, just as a fly wants to enjoy a fire. This
illusion is the net result of the conditioned soul’s forgetfulness of his eternal rela-
tionship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When conditioned, the soul is
impelled by the material energy to engage in sense gratification, whereas one en-
lightened by the spiritual energy engages himself in the service of the Supreme Lord
in his eternal relationship.

Krsna is the original cause of the spiritual world, and He is the covered cause of
the material manifestation. He is also the original cause of the marginal potency, the
living entities. He is both the leader and maintainer of the living entities, who are
called marginal potency because they can act under the protection of the spiritual
energy or under the cover of the material energy. With the help of the spiritual
energy we can understand that independence is visible only in Krsna, who by His
inconceivable energy is able to act in any way He likes.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the Absolute Whole, and the living entities
are parts of the Absolute Whole. This relationship of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead and the living entities is eternal. One should never mistakenly think that
the spiritual whole can be divided into small parts by the small material energy.
Bhagavad-gita does not support this Mayavada theory. Rather, it clearly states that
the living entities are eternally small fragments of the supreme spiritual whole. As a
part can never be equal with the whole, so a living entity, as a minute fragment of
the spiritual whole, cannot be equal at any time to the Supreme Whole, the
absolute Personality of Godhead. Although the Supreme Lord and the living entities
are quantitatively related as the whole and the parts, the parts are nevertheless
qualitatively one with the whole. Thus the living entities, although always qualita-
tively one with the Supreme Lord, are in a relative position. The Supreme
Personality of Godhead is the controller of everything, and the living entities are
always controlled either by the spiritual energy or by the material energy. Therefore
a living entity can never become the controller of material or spiritual energies. The
natural position of the living being is always as a subordinate of the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead. When one agrees to act in such a position, he attains perfection
in life, but if one rebels against this principle, he is in the conditioned state.

In His form as Karanodakasayi Visnu the Lord impregnates material nature by His
glance. The transcendental molecules of that glance are particles of spirit, or
spiritual atoms, which appear in different species of life according to the seeds of
their individual karma from the previous cosmic manifestation. And the Lord Him-
self, by His partial representation, creates a body of innumerable universes and
again enters each of those universes as Garbodakasayi ৬1900. His coming in contact
with maya is explained in Bhagavad-gita by a comparison between air and the sky.
The sky enters everything material, yet it is far away from us.

This description of the Lord's creative energy is from the Brahma-sarhhita (5.48),
which Lord Brahma compiled after his personal realization. When Maha-Visnu ex-
hales, the spiritual seeds of the universe emanate from Him in the form of molecular
particles like those that are visible, three times the size of an atom, when sunlight is
diffused through a small hole. In these days of atomic research it will be a worth-
while engagement for atomic scientists to learn from this statement how the entire
universe develops from the spiritual atoms emanating from the body of the Lord.

When Lord Brahma, after having stolen all ।< [525 cows and cowherd boys, re-
turned and saw that the cows and boys were still roaming with Krsna, he offered
this prayer (Bhag. 10.14.11) in his defeat. A conditioned soul, even one so great
as Brahma, who manages the affairs of the entire universe, cannot compare to the
Personality of Godhead, for He can produce numberless universes simply by the
spiritual rays emanating from the pores of His body. Material scientists should take
lessons from the utterances of Sri Brahma regarding our insignificance in comparison
to God. In these prayers of Brahma there is much to learn for those who are falsely
puffed up by the accumulation of power.

PURPORT
The symptoms of the purusa are described in Laghu-bhagavatamrta. While de-
scribing the incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the author has
quoted from the Vispu Purana (6.8.59), where it is said: ‘‘Let me offer my respectful
obeisances unto Purusottama, Lord Krsna, who is always free from the contamination
of the six material dualities; whose plenary expansion, Maha-Visnu, glances over
matter to create the cosmic manifestation; who expands Himself in various transcen-
dental forms, all of which are one and the same; who is the master of all living
entities; who is always free and liberated from the contamination of material
energy; and who, when He appears in this material world, seems one of us, although
He has an eternally spiritual, blissful, transcendental form.”’ In summarizing this
statement, Ripa Gosvamt has concluded that the plenary expansion of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead who acts in cooperation with the material energy is called
the purusa.

TRANSLATION
“Visnu has three forms called purusas. The first, Maha-Visnu, is the creator of
the total material energy [mahat], the second is Garbhodasayi, who is situated
within each universe, and the third is Ksirodasayi, who lives in the heart of every
living being. He who knows these three becomes liberated from the clutches of
maya.”

PURPORT
Describing the incarnations and their symptoms, the Laghu-bhdgavatamrta has
stated that when Lord Krsna descends to conduct the creative affairs of the material
manifestation, He is an avatdra, or incarnation. The two categories of avataras are
empowered devotees and tad-ekdtma-rapa (the Lord Himself). An example of


--- Page 440 ---
Adi-lila, Chapter 5 441
tad-ekatma-riipa is Sesa, and an example of a devotee is Vasudeva, the father of Lord
Krsna. Srila Baladeva Vidyabhiisana has commented that the material cosmic mani-
festation is a partial kingdom of God where God must sometimes come to execute
a specific function. The plenary portion of the Lord through whom Lord Krsna
executes such actions is called Maha-Visnu, who is the primal beginning of all in-
carnations. inexperienced observers presume that the material energy provides both
the cause and elements of the cosmic manifestation and that the living entities are
the enjoyers of material nature. But the devotees of the bhdgavata school, which
has scrutinizingly examined the entire situation, can understand that material nature
can independently be neither the supplier of the material elements nor the cause of
the material manifestation. Material nature gets the power to supply the material
elements from the glance of the supreme puruga, Maha-Visnu, and when empowered
by Him she is called the cause of the material manifestation. Both features of ma-
terial nature, as the cause of the material creation and as the source of its elements,
exist due to the glance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The various expan-
sions of the Supreme Lord who act to empower the material energy are known as
plenary expansions or incarnations. As illustrated by the example of many flames
lit from one flame, all these plenary expansions and incarnations are as good as
Visnpu Himself; nevertheless, because of their activities in controlling maya, some-
times they are known 25 mdyika, or having a relationship with maya. This is a verse
from Srimad-Bhagavatam (2.6.42).

This is a verse from S$rimad-Bhagavatam (1.3.1). The commentary of Madhva on
Srimad-Bhagavatam mentions that the following sixteen spiritual energies are present
in the spiritual world: (1) $, (2) bha, (3) lila, (4) kanti, (5) kirti, (6) tusti, (7) 47,
(8) pusti, (9) satya, (10) jAanajiana, (11) jaya utkarsini, (12) vimala, (13) yogamaya,
(14) prahvi, (15) Bana and (16) anugrahd. In his commentary on the Laghu-
bhagavatamyta, Sri Baladeva Vidyabhisana has said that the above energies are also
known by nine names: (1)vimala, (2) utkarsini, (3) jAidna, (4) kriya, (5) yoga, (6)
prahvi, (7) satya, (8) Bana and (9) anugrahd. In the Bhagavat-sandarbha of Srila
Jiva Gosvami (verse 117) they are described as $7, pusti, gih, kanti, kirti, tusti, ila,
jaya, vidyavidya, maya, samvit, sandhini, hladini, bhakti, marti, vimala, yoga,
prahvi, 18370, anugraha, etc. All these energies act in different spheres of the Lord’s
supremacy.

TRANSLATION

Although He is thus connected with the material energy in two ways, He does

not have the slightest contact with it.
PURPORT

In the Laghu-bhagavatamrta, Srila Rapa Gosvami, commenting upon the Lord's
transcendental position beyond the material qualities, says that Visnu, as the con-
troller and superintendent of material nature, has a connection with the material
qualities. That connection is called ‘‘voga.”” However, the person who directs a
prison is not also a prisoner. Similarly, although the Supreme Personality of
Godhead Visnu directs or supervises the qualitative nature, He has no connection
with the material modes of nature. The expansions of Lord Visnu always retain
their supremacy; they are never connected with the material qualities. One may
argue that Maha-Visnu cannot have any connection with the material qualities, be-
cause if He were so connected, Srimad-Bhagavatam would not state that material
nature, ashamed of her thankless task of acting to induce the living entities to be-
come averse to the Supreme Lord, remains behind the Lord in shyness. In answer
to this argument, it may be said that the word 09800 means ‘‘regulation.” Lord
৬1506, Lord Brahma and Lord Siva are situated within this universe as the direc-
tors of the three modes, and their connection with the modes is known as yoga.
This does not indicate, however, that these personalities are bound by the qualities
of nature. Lord Visnu specifically is always the controller of the three qualities.
There is no question of His coming under their control.

Although the causal and element-supplying features exist in material nature by
dint of the glance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Lord is never
affected by glancing over the material qualities. By the will of the Supreme Lord
the different qualitative changes in the material world take place, but there is no
possibility of material affection, change or contamination for Lord Visnu.

Adi-fil3, Chapter 5 445
PURPORT

Nothing in existence is possible unless energized by the will of the Lord. The
entire manifested creation is therefore resting on the energy of the Lord, but one
should not therefore presume that the material manifestation is identical with the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. A cloud may rest in the sky, but that does not
mean that the sky and the cloud are one and the same. Similarly, the qualitative
material nature and its products are never identical with the Supreme Lord. The
tendency to lord it over material nature, or mdyd, cannot be a feature of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. When He descends to the material world, He
maintains His transcendental nature, unaffected by the material qualities. In both
the spiritual and material worlds, He is always the controller of all energies. The
uncontaminated spiritual nature always exists within Him. The Lord appears and
disappears in the material world in different features for His pastimes, yet He is the
origin of all cosmic manifestations.

The material manifestation cannot exist separate from the Supreme Lord, yet
Lord Visnu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in spite of His connection with
material nature, cannot be subordinate to nature’s influence. His original form of
eternal bliss and knowledge is never subordinate to the three qualities of material
nature. This is a specific feature of the Supreme Lord’s inconceivable potencies.

whom is Garbhodakasayi Visnu. From the navel of Garbhodakasayi Visnu sprouts
the lotus that is the birthplace of Brahma, the engineer of the universe. The stem of
that lotus is the resting place of the multitude of planets.

PURPORT

In the Mahabharata, Santi-parva, it is said that He who is Pradyumna is also
Aniruddha. He is also the father of Brahma. Thus Garbhodaka$ayi Visnu and
Ksirodakasayi Vispu are identical plenary expansions of Pradyumna, the original
Deity of Brahma, who is born from the lotus flower. It is Pradyumna who gives
Brahma direction for cosmic management. A full description of Brahma’s birth is
given in Srimad-Bhagavatam (3.8.15-16).

Describing the features of the three purusas, the Laghu-bhdgavatamrta says that
Garbhodakasayl Visnu has a four-handed form, and when He Himself enters the
hollow of the universe and lies down in the ocean of milk He is known as
Ksirodakasayi Visnu, who is the Supersoul of all living entities, including the
demigods. In the Satvata Tantra it is said that the third puruysa incarnation,
KsirodakasayT ৬1506, is situated as the Supersoul in everyone’s heart. This
Ksirodakas$ayi Visnu is an expansion of Garbhodaka&ayi Visnu for pastimes.

SYNONYMS

vispu-rapa—the form of Lord Visnu; hania—becoming; kare—does; jagat palane—
maintenance of the material world; gupa-atita—beyond the material qualities; vispu
—Lord Visnu; sparsa—touch; ndhi—not; mdyad-gupe—in the material qualities.

TRANSLATION

And as Lord Visnu He maintains the entire world. Lord Visnu, being beyond all

material attributes, has no touch with the material qualities.
PURPORT

৩11. Baladeva Vidyabhisana says that although Visnu is the predominating Deity
of the quality of goodness in the material world, He is never affected by the quality
of goodness, for He directs that quality simply by His supreme will. It is said that
all living entities can derive all good fortune from the Lord simply by His will. In
the Vdmana Purana it is said that the same Visnu expands Himself as Brahma and
Siva to direct the different qualities.

Because Lord ৬1500 expands the quality of goodness, He has the name
Sattvatanu. The multifarious incarnations of Kgsirodaka$ayi Visnu are known as
Sattvatanu. Therefore in all Vedic scriptures Visnu has been described as being free
from all material qualities. In the Tenth Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam it is said:

harir hi nirgunpah saksat
purusah prakrteh parah
sa sarva-dfg upadrasta
tarn bhajan nirgupo bhavet
“The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, is always uncontaminated by the
modes of material nature, for He is beyond the material manifestation. He is the
source of the knowledge of all the demigods, headed by Lord Brahma, and He is the
witness of everything. Therefore one who worships the Supreme Lord Visnu also
attains freedom from the contamination of material nature.” (Bhdg. 10.88.5) One
can attain freedom from the contamination of material nature by worshiping Visnu,
and therefore He is called Sattvatanu, as described above.

PURPORT
Mahesvara, or Lord Siva, is not an ordinary living being, nor is he equal to Lord
Vispu. Effectively comparing Lord Visnu and Lord Siva, the Brahma-sarhhita says
that Vispu is like milk, whereas Siva is like curd. Curd is nothing like milk, but
nevertheless it is milk also.

PURPORT
The Laghu-bhdgavatamrta gives the following description of the Visnuloka
within this universe, quoted from the Visnu-dharmottara: ‘Above Rudraloka, the
planet of Lord Siva, is the planet called Visnuloka, 400,000 miles in circumference,
which is inaccessible for any mortal living being. Above that Vispuloka and east of
the Sumeru Hill is a golden island called Maha-Visnpuloka in the ocean of salt.
Lord Brahma and other demigods sometimes go there to meet Lord Vispu. Lord
Visnu lies there with the goddess of fortune, and it is said that during the four
months of the rainy season He enjoys sleeping on that Sesa Naga bed. East of
Sumeru is the ocean of milk, in which there is a white city on a white island where
the Lord can be seen sitting with His consort, Laksmiji, on a throne of Sesa. That
feature of Visnu also enjoys sleeping during the four months of the rainy season.
The Svetadvipa in the milk ocean is situated just south of the ocean of salt. It is
calculated that the area of Svetadvipa is 200,000 square miles. This transcendentally


--- Page 456 ---
Adi-lila, Chapter 5 457
beautiful island is decorated with desire trees to please Lord Visnu and His consort.”
There are references to Svetadvipa in the Brahmapnda Purdpa, Vispu Purana,
Mahabharata and Padma Purana, and there is the following reference in the Srimad-
Bhagavatam (11.15.18).

Sveta-dvipa-patau cittarh
Suddhe dharma-maye mayi

“My dear Uddhava, you may know that My transcendental form of Vispu in
Svetadvipa is identical with Me in divinity. Anyone who places this Lord of
Svetadvipa within his heart can surpass the pangs of the six material tribulations:
hunger, thirst, birth, death, lamentation and illusion. Thus one can attain his
original transcendental form.”

PURPORT
Lord Visnu, who lies in the ocean of milk, incarnates Himself in various forms to
maintain the laws of the cosmos and annihilate the causes of disturbance. Such
incarnations are visible in every manvantara (i.e., in the course of the reign of each
Manu, who lives for 71 x 4,300,000 years). Fourteen such Manus take their birth
and die, to yield a place for the next, during one day of Brahma.

TRANSLATION
The universe, which measures five hundred million yojanas in diameter, rests on

PURPORT
The Lord of Svetadvipa expands Himself 25 Sesa Naga, who sustains all the planets
upon His innumerable hoods. These huge. global spheres are compared to grains of
mustard resting on the spiritual hoods of Sesa Naga. The scientists’ law of gravity is
a partial explanation of Lord Sankarsana’s energy. The name ‘‘Sarikarsapa’ has an
etymological relationship to the idea of gravity. There is a reference to Sesa Naga in
the Bhdgavata Purana (5.17.21), where it is said:
yam hur asya sthiti-janma-sarhyamarh
tribhir vihinarh yam anantam fsayah
na veda siddartham iva kvacit sthitarh
bha-mandalarin mardha-sahasra-dhamasu
“O my Lord, the hymns of the Vedas proclaim that You are the effective cause for
the creation, maintenance and destruction. But in fact You are transcendental to all
limitations and are therefore known as unlimited. On Your thousands of hoods rest
the innumerable global spheres, like grains of mustard so insignificant that You have
no perception of their weight.” The Bhdgavatam further says (5.25.2):
yasyedarn ksiti-mapdalarh bhagavato
‘nanta-marteh sahasra-$irasa ekasminn
eva Sirsani dhriyamanarh siddhartha iva laksyate
“Lord Anantadeva has thousands of hoods. Each sustains a global sphere that appears
like a grain of mustard.”

TRANSLATION
That Ananta-Sesa is the devotee incarnation of Godhead. He knows nothing but
service to Lord Krsna.
PURPORT
Srila Jiva Gosvamt, in his Krspa-sandarbha, has described Sesa Naga as follows:
“Srt Anantadeva has thousands of faces and is fully independent. Always ready to
serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He waits upon Him constantly. 531) 1८275213.
is the first expansion of Vasudeva, and because He appears by His own will, He is
called svarat, fully independent. He is therefore infinite and transcendental to all
limits of time and space. He Himself appears as the thousand-headed Sesa.” In the
Skanda Purana, in the Ayodhya-mahatmya Chapter, the demigod Indra requested
Lord Sesa, who was standing before him as Laksmana, “Please go to Your eternal
abode, Visnuloka, where Your expansion Sesa, with His serpentine hoods, is also
present.” After thus dispatching Laksmana to the regions of Patiala, Lord Indra
returned to his abode. This quotation indicates that the Sankarsapa of the quadruple
form descends with Lord Rima as Laksmana. When Lord Rama disappears, Sesa
again separates Himself from the personality of Laksmana. Sesa then returns to His
own abode in the Patiala regions, and Laksmana returns to His abode in Vaikuntha.
The Laghu-bhagavatamyta gives the following description: “The 53113115303 of
the second group of quadruple forms appears as Rama, taking with Him $esa, who
bears the global spheres. There are two features of Sesa. One is the bearer of the
globes, and the other is the bedstead servitor. The $esa who bears the globes is a
potent incarnation of 95311315303, and therefore He is sometimes also called
Sahkarsapa. The bedstead feature of Sesa always presents himself as an eternal
servitor of the Lord.”

PURPORT

In this connection we may mention an incident that took place between two of
our sannyasis while we were preaching the Hare Krsna maha-mantra in Hyderabad.
One of them stated that “Hare Rama’’ refers to Sri Balarama, and the other protested
that “Hare Rama’’ means Lord Rima. Ultimately the controversy came to me, and
| gave the decision that if someone says that ‘Rama’ in ‘Hare Rama" is Lord
Ramacandra and someone else says that the “কি 3773 in “Hare Rama’ 15 Sri Balarama,
both are correct because there is no difference between Sri Balarama and Lord
Rama. Here in $77 Caitanya-caritamrta we find that 10150302353 Kavirija Gosvami has
stated the same conclusion:

vei yei rape jane, sei taha kahe
sakala sambhave krsne, Richu mithya nahe


--- Page 466 ---
Adi-fila, Chapter 5 467
10 someone calls Lord Ramacandra by the vibration Hare Rama, or if he under-
stands Ramacandra, he is quite right. Similarly, if one says that Hare Rima means 911.
Balarama, he is also right. Those who are aware of the vispu-tattva do not fight over
all these details.

In the Laghu-bhagavatamrta Srila Ripa Gosvamt has explained Krsna’s being both
Ksirodaka$ayi Visnu and Narayana in the spiritual sky and expanding in quadruple
forms like Vasudeva, Sarikarsana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha. He has refuted the
idea that Krsna is an incarnation of Narayana. Some devotees think that Narayana
is the original Personality of Godhead and that Krsna is an incarnation. Even
Sarikaracarya, in his commentary on Bhagavad-gitda, has accepted Narayana as the
transcendental Personality of Godhead who appeared as Krsna, the son of Devaki
and Vasudeva. Therefore this matter may be difficult to understand. But the
Gaudiya-Vaispava-sampradaya, headed by Ripa Gosvami, has established the prin-
ciple of Bhagavad-gita that everything emanates from Krsna, who says in Bhagavad-
gita, aharh sarvasyaprabhavah: «| am the original source of everything.’ “Everything”
includes Narayana. Therefore Ripa Gosvami, in the Laghu-bhdgavatamrta, has es-
tablished that Krsna, not Narayana, is the original Personality of Godhead.

In this connection he has quoted a verse from Srimad-Bhagavatam (3.2.15) that
states:

sva-$anta-riapesv itaraih sva-riapair
abhyardyamanesv anukampitatma
paravareso mahad-arh$a-yukto
hy ajo pi jato bhagavan yathagnih
“When pure devotees of the Lord like Vasudeva are greatly disturbed by dangerous
demons like 13153, Lord Krsna joins with all His pastime expansions, such as the
Lord of Vaikuntha, and, although unborn, becomes manifest, just as fire becomes
manifest by the friction of arani wood.” Arani wood is used to ignite a sacrificial
fire without matches or any other flame. Just as fire appears from arani wood, the
Supreme Lord appears when there is friction between devotees and nondevotees.
When Krsna appears, He appears in full, including within Himself all His expansions
like Narayana, Vasudeva, ऽ 210 (६2152113, Aniruddha and Pradyumna. Krsna is always
integrated with His other incarnations, like Nrsirhhadeva, Varaha, Vamana, Nara-
Narayana, Hayagriva and Ajita. In Vrndavana sometimes Lord Krsna exhibits the
functions of such incarnations.

In the Brahmanda Purana it is said: “The same Personality of Godhead who is
known in Vaikuntha as the four-handed Narayana, the friend of all living entities,
and in the milk ocean as the Lord of Svetadvipa, and who is the best of all purusas,
appeared as the son of Nanda. In a fire there are many sparks of different dimen-
sions; some of them are very big, and some are small. The small sparks are compared
to the living entities, and the large sparks are compared to the Visnu expansions of
Lord Krsna. All the incarnations emanate from Krsna, and after the end of their
pastimes they again merge with Krsna.”

Therefore in the various Puranas Krsna is described sometimes as Narayana,
sometimes as Ksirodakasayi Visnu, sometimes as Garbhodakasayi Visnu and some-


--- Page 467 ---
468 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta
times as Vaikunthanatha, the Lord of Vaikuntha. Because Krsna is always full,
Mala Sankarsapa is in Krsna, and since all incarnations are manifested Ifrom Mila
Sankarsana, it should be understood that He can manifest different incarnations by
His supreme will, even in the presence of Krsna. Great sages have therefore glorified
the Lord by different names. Thus when the original person, the source of all
incarnations, is sometimes described as an incarnation, there is no discrepancy.

cowherd boys with his own mystic power. Sri Krsna responded, however, by re-
placing all the cows and boys in the field. Lord Balarama’s thoughts of astonish-
ment at such wonderful retaliation are recorded in this verse (Bhdg. 10.13.37).

Lord Caitanya always offered respects to Advaita Prabhu as He would to His
father because Advaita was even older than His father; yet Advaita Prabhu always
considered Himself a servant of Lord Caitanya. Sri Advaita Prabhu and Tévara Puri,
Lord Caitanya’s spiritual master, were both disciples of Madhavendra Puri, who was
also the spiritual master of Nityananda Prabhu. Thus Advaita Prabhu, as Lord
Caitanya’s spiritual uncle, was always to be respected because one should respect
one’s spiritual master’s Godbrothers as one respects one’s spiritual master. Because
of all these considerations, $ri- Advaita Prabhu was superior to Lord Caitanya, yet
Advaita Prabhu considered Himself Lord Caitanya’s subordinate.

Among the sannyasis of the Sankara-sampradaya there are different names for
brahmacaris. Each sannyasi has some assistants, known as brahmacaris, who are
called by different names according to the names of the sannydsi. Among such
brahmacaris there are four names: Svaripa, Ananda, Prakasa and Caitanya.
Nityananda Prabhu maintained himself as a brahmacari; He never took sannydsa. As
a brahmacari His name was Nityananda Svariipa, and therefore the sannydsi under
whom He was living must have been from the tirthas or aSramas because the
assistant brahmacari of such a sannyasi is called Nityananda Svarapa.

PURPORT
Minaketana Ramadasa was a great devotee of Lord Nityananda. When he entered
the house of Krgnadasa Kaviraja, Gunparpava Misra, the priest who was worshiping
the Deity installed in the house, did not receive him very well. A similar event
occurred when Romaharsana-siita was speaking to the great assembly of sages at
Naimisaranya. Lord Baladeva entered that great assembly, but since Romaharsana-
5012 was on the vydsdsana, he did not get down to offer respect to Lord Baladeva.
The behavior of Gunarpava Misra indicated that he had no great respect for Lord
Nityananda, and this idea was not at all palatable to Minaketana Ramadasa. For
this reason the mentality of Minaketana Ramadasa is never deprecated by devotees.

By the mercy of Sanatana Gosvami | have leamed the final conclusions of devo-
tional service, and by the grace of Sei Ripa Gosvami | have tasted the highest nectar
of devotional service.
PURPORT
Sri Saniatana Gosvami Prabhu, the teacher of the science of devotional service,
wrote several books, of which the Brhad-bhagavatamrta is very famous; anyone who
wants to know about the subject matter of devotees, devotional service and Krsna
must read this book. Sanatana Gosvami also wrote a special commentary on the
Tenth Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam known as the Dasama-tippani, which is so ex-
cellent that by reading it one can understand very deeply the pastimes of Krspa in
His exchanges of loving activities. Another famous book by Sanatana Gosvami is
the Hari-bhakti-vilasa, which states the rules and regulations for all divisions of
Vaisnavas, namely, Vaisnava householders, Vaisnava-brahmacaris, ‘Vaisnava vana-
prasthas and Vaisnava sannyasis. This book was especially written, however, for
Vaisnava householders. Srila Raghunitha dasa Gosvami has described Sanatana
Gosvami in his prayer Vildpa-kusumarijali, verse six, where he has expressed his
obligation to Sanatana Gosvami in the following words:
vairagya-yug-bhakti-rasari prayatnair
apdayayan mam anabhipsum andham
krpambudhir yah para-dubkha-duhkhi
sandtanas tari parbhum asrayami
^| was unwilling to drink the nectar of devotional service possessed of renunciation,
but Sanatana Gosvami, out of his causeless mercy, made me drink it, even though
| was otherwise unable to do so. Therefore he is an ocean of mercy. He is very much
compassionate to fallen souls like me, and thus it is my duty to offer my respectful
obeisances unto his lotus feet.” Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami also, in the last section


--- Page 498 ---
Adi-lila, Chapter 5 499
of Caitanya-caritamyta, specifically mentions the names of Ripa Gosvami, Sanatana
Gosvami and Srila Jiva Gosvami and offers his respectful obeisances unto the lotus
feet of these three spiritual masters, as well as Raghunatha dasa. Srila Raghunitha
dasa Gosvami also accepted Sanatana Gosvami as the teacher of the science of
devotional service. Srila Ripa Gosvami is described as the bhakti-rasacdrya, or one
who knows the essence of devotional service. His famous book Bhakti-rasamyta-
sindhu is the science of devotional service, and by reading this book one can under-
stand the meaning of devotional service. Another of his famous books is Ujjvala-
nilamapi. In this book he elaborately explains the loving affairs and transcendental
activities of Lord Krsna and Radharani.

PURPORT
Srila Narottama dasa Thakura, who is famous for his poetic composition known
as Prarthand, has lamented in one of his prayers, “When will Lord Nityananda be
merciful upon me so that | will forget all material desires?” Srila Narottama dasa
Thakura confirms that unless one is freed from material desires to satisfy the needs
of the body and senses, one cannot understand the transcendental abode of Lord
Krsna, Vyndavana. He also confirms that one cannot understand the loving affairs
of Radha and 1৫903 without going through the direction of the six Gosvamis. In
another verse Narottama dasa Thakura has stated that without the causeless mercy
of Nityananda Prabhu, one cannot enter into the affairs of Radha and Krsna.

TRANSLATION

Lord Brahma, sitting on his lotus seat in his own abode, always meditates on

Him and worships Him with the mantra consisting of eighteen syllables.
PURPORT

In his own planet, Lord Brahma, with the inhabitants of that planet, worships the
form of Lord Govinda, Krsna, by the mantra of eighteen syllables, klirh krspaya
govindaya gopijana-vallabhaya svaha. Those who are initiated by a bona fide spiritual
master and who chant the Gayatri mantra three times a day know this astddasaksara,
eighteen-syllable mantra. The inhabitants of Brahmaloka and the planets below
Brahmaloka worship Lord Govinda by meditating with this mantra. There is no
difference between meditating and chanting, but in the present meditation is
not possible on this planet. Therefore loud chanting of a mantra like the maha-
mantra, Hare Krsna, with soft chanting of the astadasaksara, the mantra of eighteen
syllables, is recommended.

Lord Brahma lives in the highest planetary system, known as Brahmaloka or
Satyaloka. In every planet there is a predominating deity. As the predominating
deity in Satyaloka is Lord Brahma, so in the heavenly planets Indra is the predomi-
nating deity, and on the sun, the sun-god, Vivasvan, is the predominating deity. The


--- Page 506 ---
Adi-lila, Chapter 5 507
inhabitants and predominating deities of every planet are all reccommended to
worship Govinda either by meditation or by chanting.

508 Sri Caitanya-caritimrta
Lord Krsna she engaged herself in meditation. When asked by Krsna why she
engaged in meditation with austerity, Laksmidevi answered, “I want to be one of
Your associates like the gopis in Vrndavana.” Hearing this, Lord $ri Krsna replied
that it was quite impossible. Laksmidevi then said that she wanted to remain just
like a golden line on the chest of the Lord. The Lord granted the request, and
since then Laksmi has always been situated on the chest of Lord Krsna as a golden
line. The austerity and meditation of Laksmidevi are also mentioned in the $rimad-
Bhagavatam (10.16.36), where the Nagapatnis, the wives of the: serpent Kaliya, in
the course of their prayers to Krsna, said that the goddess of fortune, Laksmi, also
wanted His association as a 40/27 and desired the dust of His lotus feet.

“My dear friend, if you are indeed attached to your worldly friends, do not look
at the smiling face of Lord Govinda as He stands on the bank of the Yamuna at
Kesighata. Casting sidelong glances, He places His flute to His lips, which seem like
newly blossomed twigs. His transcendental body, bending in three places, appears
very bright in the moonlight.”
PURPORT
This is a verse quoted from Bhakti-rasamyta-sindhu (1.2.239) in connection with
practical devotional service. Generally people in their conditioned life engage in the


--- Page 508 ---
Adi-lifa, Chapter 5 509
pleasure of society, friendship and love. This so-called love is lust, not love. But
people are satisfied with such a false understanding of love. Vidyapati, a great and
learned poet of Mithila, has said that the pleasure derived from friendship, society
and family life in the material world is like a drop of water, but our hearts desire
pleasure like an ocean. Thus the heart is compared to a desert of material existence
that requires the water of an ocean of pleasure to satisfy its dryness. if there is a
drop of water in the desert, one may indeed say that it is water, but such a minute
quantity of water has no value. Similarly, in this material world no one is satisfied
in the dealings of society, friendship and love. Therefore if one wants to derive real
pleasure within his heart, he must seek the lotus feet of Govinda. In this verse Ripa
Gosvami indicates that if one wants to be satisfied in the pleasure of society,
friendship and love, he need not seek shelter at the lotus feet of Govinda, for if
one takes shelter under His lotus feet he will forget that minute quantity of so-
called pleasure. One who is not satisfied with that so-called pleasure may seek the
lotus feet of Govinda, who stands on the shore of the Yamuna at Kes$itirtha, or
Kesighata, in Vrndavana and attracts all the 40275 to His transcendental loving
service.

PURPORT

In the Bhakti-sandarbha [1\/2 Gosvami has stated that those who are actually
very serious about devotional service do not differentiate between the form of the
Lord made of clay, metal, stone or wood and the original form of the Lord. In the
material world a person and his photograph, picture or statue are different. But the
statue of Lord Krsna and Krsna Himself, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are
not different, because the Lord is absolute. What we call stone, wood and metal
are energies of the Supreme Lord, and energies are never separate from the energetic.
As we have several times explained, no one can separate the sunshine energy from
the energetic sun. Therefore material energy may appear separate from the Lord,
but transcendentally it is nondifferent from the Lord.

The Lord can appear anywhere and everywhere because His diverse energies are
distributed everywhere like sunshine. We should therefore understand whatever we
see to be the energy of the Supreme Lord and should not differentiate between
the Lord and His arcd form made from clay, metal, wood or paint. Even if one has
not developed this consciousness, one should accept it theoretically from the in-
structions of the spiritual master and should worship the arca-marti, or form of
the Lord in the temple, as nondifferent from the Lord.

The Padma Purana specifically mentions that anyone who thinks the form of the
Lord in the temple to be made of wood, stone or metal is certainly in a hellish
condition. Impersonalists are against the worship of the 01015 form in the temple,
and there is even a group of people who pass as Hindus but condemn such worship.
Their so-called acceptance of the Vedas has no meaning, for all the acaryas, even
the impersonalist Sankaracarya, have recommended the worship of the transcen-
dental form of the Lord. Impersonalists like Safkaracarya recommend the worship
of five forms, known 25 paficopasand, which include Lord Visnu. Vaispavas, how-
ever, worship the forms of Lord \/15 ८ in His varied manifestations, such as Radha-
Krsna, Laksmi-Narayana, Sita-Rama and Rukmini-Krspa. Mayavadis admit that
worship of the Lord’s form is required in the beginning, but they think that in the
end everything is impersonal. Therefore, since they are ultimately against worship
of the Lord’s form, Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has described them as offenders.

Srimad-Bhagavatam has condemned those who think the body to be the self as
bhauma ijya-dhih. Bhauma means earth, and ijya-dhih means worshiper. There are
two kinds of bhauma ijya-dhih: those who worship the land of their birth, such as
nationalists, who make many sacrifices for the motherland, and those who condemn


--- Page 510 ---
Adi-lila, Chapter 5 511
the worship of the form of the Lord. One should not worship the planet earth or
land of his birth, nor should one condemn the form of the Lord, which is mani-
fested in metal or wood for our facility. Material things are also the energy of the
Supreme Lord.

PURPORT

All the inhabitants of Vrndavana are Vaispavas. They are all-auspicious because
somehow or other they always chant the holy name of Krsna. Even though some of
them do not strictly follow the rules and regulations of devotional service, on the
whole they are devotees of Krsna and chant His name directly or indirectly.
Purposely or without purpose, even when they pass on the street they are fortunate
enough to exchange greetings by saying the name of Radha or Krsna. Thus directly
or indirectly they are auspicious.

The present city of Vrndavana has been established by the Gaudiya Vaisnavas
since the six Gosvamis went there and directed the construction of their different
temples. Of all the temples in Vrndavana, ninety percent belong to the Gaudiya
Vaisnava sect, the followers of the teachings of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu and
Nityananda, and seven temples are very famous. The inhabitants of Vrndavana do
not know anything but the worship of Radha and Krsna. In recent years some
unscrupulous so-called priests known 25 caste gosvarnis have introduced the worship
of demigods privately, but no genuine and rigid Vaisnavas participate in this. Those
who are serious about the Vaisnava method of devotional activities do not take
part in such worship of demigods.

The Gaudiya Vaisnavas never differentiate between Radha-Krsna and Lord
Caitanya. They say that since Lord Caitanya is the combined form of Radha-Krsna,
He is not different from Radha and Krsna. But some misled people try to prove
that they are greatly elevated by saying that they like to chant the holy name ০1.


--- Page 513 ---
514 Sri” Caitanya-caritamrta

Lord Gaura instead of the names Radha and Krsna. Thus they purposely differen-
tiate between Lord Caitanya and Radha-Krsna. According to them, the system of
nadiya-nagari, which they have recently invented in their fertile brains, is the
worship of Gaura, Lord Caitanya, but they do not like to worship Radha and
Krsna. They put forward the argument that since Lord Caitanya Himself appeared
as Radha and Krsna combined, there is no necessity of worshiping Radha and
Krsna. Such differentiation by so-called devotees of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu is
considered disruptive by pure devotees. Anyone who differentiates between Radha-
Krsna and Gauranga is to be considered a plaything in the hands of maya.

There are others who are against the worship of Caitanya Mahaprabhu, thinking
Him mundane. But any sect that differentiates between Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu
and Radha-Krsna, either by worshiping Radha-Krsna as distinct from Lord Caitanya
or by worshiping Lord Caitanya but not Radha-Kysna, is in the group of prakrta-
sahajiyas.

Srila Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami, the author of Caitanya-caritamrta, predicts in
verses 225 and 226 that in the future those who manufacture imaginary methods
of worship will gradually give up the worship of Radha-Krsna, and although
they will call themselves devotees of Lord Caitanya, they will also give up the
worship of Caitanya Mahaprabhu and fall down into material activities. For the
real worshipers of Lord Caitanya, the ultimate goal of life is to worship Sri Sri
Radha and Krsna.

Adi-{ilg
The truth of Advaita Acarya has been described in two different verses. It is said
that material nature has two features, namely the material cause and the efficient
cause. The efficient causal activities are caused by Maha-Visnu, and the material
causal activities are caused by another form of Maha-Visnu, known as Advaita.
That Advaita, the superintendent of the cosmic manifestation, has descended in the
form of Advaita to associate with Lord Caitanya. When He is addressed as the
servitor of Lord Caitanya, His glories are magnified because unless one is invigorated
by this mentality of servitorship one cannot understand the mellows derived from
devotional service to the Supreme Lord, Krsna.

TRANSLATION

Sri Advaita Acarya is all-auspicious to the world, for He is a reservoir of all-

auspicious attributes. His characteristics, activities and name are always auspicious.
PURPORT

Sri Advaita Prabhu, who is an incarnation of Maha-Visnu, is an dcdrya, or teacher.
All His activities and all the other activities of Visnu are auspicious. Anyone who
can view the all-auspiciousness in the pastimes of Lord Visnu also becomes auspi-
cious simultaneously. Therefore, since Lord Visnu is the fountainhead of auspicious-
ness, anyone who is attracted by the devotional service of Lord Visnu can render the
greatest service to human society. Rejected persons of the material world who re-
fuse to understand pure devotional service as the eternal function of the living en-
tities, and as actual liberation of the living being from conditional life, become
bereft of all devotional service because of their poor fund of knowledge.

In the teachings of Advaita Prabhu there is no question of fruitive activities or
impersonal liberation. Bewildered by the spell of material energy, however, persons
who could not understand that Advaita Prabhu is nondifferent from Visnu wanted
to follow Him with their impersonal conceptions. The attempt of Advaita Prabhu
to punish them is also auspicious. Lord Visnu and His activities can bestow all good
fortune, directly and indirectly. In other words, being favored by. Lord Visnu and
being punished by Lord Visnu are one and the same because all the activities of
Visnu are absolute. According to some, Mangala was another name of Advaita
Prabhu. As the causal incarnation, or Lord Visnu’s incarnation for a particular
occasion, He is the supply agent or ingredient in material nature. However, He is
never to be considered material. All His activities are spiritual. Anyone who hears
about and glorifies Him becomes glorified himself, for such activities free one from

all kinds of misfortune. One should not invest any material contamination or im-
personalism in the Visnu form. Everyone should try to understand the real identity
of Lord Visnu, for by such knowledge one can attain the highest stage of perfection.

TRANSLATION

Just as the external energy consists of two parts—the efficient cause [nimitta]
and the material cause [५020112] , maya being the efficient cause and pradhana the
material cause—so Lord Visnu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, assumes two
forms to create the material world with the efficient and material causes.

PURPORT

There are two kinds of research to find the original cause of creation. One con-
clusion is that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the all-blissful, eternal, all-
knowing form, is indirectly the cause of this cosmic manifestation and directly the
cause of the spiritual world, where there are innumerable spiritual planets known
as Vaikupthas as well as His personal abode, known as Goloka Vyndavana. In other
words, there are two manifestations—the material cosmos and the spiritual world.
As in the material world there are innumerable planets and universes, so in the
spiritual world there are also innumerable spiritual planets and universes, including
the Vaikupthas and Goloka. The Supreme Lord is the cause of both the material
and spiritual worlds. The other conclusion, of course, is that this cosmic manifes-
tation is caused by an inexplicable unmanifested void. This argument is meaningless.

The first conclusion is accepted by the Vedanta philosophers, and the second is
supported by the atheistic philosophical system of the Sankhya smrti, which
directly opposes the Vedantic philosophical conclusion. Material scientists cannot
see any cognizant spiritual substance that might be the cause of the creation. Such
atheistic Sankhya philosophers think that the symptoms of knowledge and living
force visible in the innumerable living creatures are caused by the three qualities of
the cosmic manifestation. Therefore the Sarikhyites are against the conclusion of
Vedanta regarding the original cause of creation.

Factually, the supreme absolute spirit soul is the cause of every kind of manifes-
tation, and He is always complete, both as the energy and as the energetic. The
cosmic manifestation is caused by the energy of the Supreme Absolute Person, in
whom all energies are conserved. Philosophers who are subjectively engaged in the
cosmic manifestation can appreciate only the wonderful energies of matter. Such
philosophers accept the conception of God only as a product of material energy.
According to their conclusions, the source of the energy is also a product of the
energy. Such philosophers wrongly observe that the living creatures within the
cosmic manifestation are caused by the material energy, and they think that the
supreme absolute conscious being must similarly be a product of the material energy.

Since materialistic philosophers and scientists are too much engaged with their
imperfect senses, naturally they conclude that the living force is a product of a ma-
terial combination. But the actual fact is just the opposite. Matter is a product of
spirit. According to Bhagavad-gita, the supreme spirit, the Personality of Godhead,
is the source of all energies. When one advances in research work by studying a
limited substance within the limits of space and time, one is amazed by the various
wonderful cosmic manifestations, and naturally one goes on hypnotically accepting
the path of research work or the inductive method. Through the deductive way of


--- Page 523 ---
Adi-fila, Chapter 6 525
understanding, however, one accepts the Supreme Absolute Person, the Personality
of Godhead, as the cause of all causes, who is full with diverse energies and who is
neither impersonal nor void. The impersonal manifestation of the Supreme Person
is another display of His energy. Therefore the conclusion that matter is the original
cause of creation is completely different from the real truth. The material manifes-
tation is caused by the glance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is incon-
ceivably potent. Material nature is electrified by the supreme authority, and the
conditioned soul, within the limits of time and space, is trapped by awe of the
material manifestation. In other words, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is
actually realized in the vision of a material philosopher and scientist through the
manifestations of His material energy. For one who does not understand the power
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His diverse energies because of not
knowing the relationship between the source of the energies and the energies them-
selves, there is always a chance of error, which is known as vivarta. As long as
materialistic scientists and philosophers do not come to the right conclusion,
certainly they will hover above the material field, bereft of proper understanding
of the Absolute Truth.

The great Vaisnava philosopher Srila Baladeva Vidyabhisana has very nicely ex-
plained the materialistic conclusion in his Govinda-bhdsya on the Vedanta-satra. He
writes as follows:

“The Sankhya philosopher Kapila has connected the different elementary truths
according to his own opinion. Material nature, according to him, consists of the
equilibrium of the three material qualities, goodness, passion and ignorance. Material
nature produced the material energy, known as mahat, and mahat produced the
false ego. The ego produced the five objects of sense perception, which produced
the ten senses (five for acquiring knowledge and five for working), the mind and the
five gross elements. Counting the purusa, or the enjoyer, with these twenty-four
elements, there are twenty-five different truths. The nonmanifested stage of these
twenty-five elementary truths is called prakrti, or material nature. The qualities of
material nature can associate in three different stages, namely as the cause of happi-
ness, the cause of distress and the cause of illusion. The quality of goodness is the
cause of material happiness, the quality of passion is the cause of material distress,
and the quality of ignorance is the cause of illusion. Our material experience lies
within the boundaries of these three manifestations of happiness, distress and illusion.
For example, a beautiful woman is certainly a cause of material happiness for one
who possesses her as a wife, but the same beautiful woman is a cause of distress to a
man whom she rejects or who is the cause of her anger, and if she leaves a man she
becomes the cause of illusion.

“The two kinds of senses are the ten external senses and the one internal sense,
the mind. Thus there are eleven senses. According to Kapila, material nature is eter-
nal and all-powerful. Originally there is no spirit, and matter has no cause. Matter
itself is the chief cause of everything. It is the all-pervading cause of all causes. The
Sankhya philosophy regards the total energy (mahat-tattva), the false ego and the
five objects of sense perception as the seven diverse manifestations of material
nature, which has two features, known as the material cause and efficient cause. The


--- Page 524 ---
526 $ri Caitanya-caritimrta

purusa, the enjoyer, is without transformation, whereas material nature is always
subject to transformation. But although material nature is inert, it is the cause of
enjoyment and salvation for many living creatures. Its activities are beyond the con-
ception of sense perception, but still one may guess at them by superior intelligence.
Material nature is one, but because of the interaction of the three qualities, it can
produce the total energy and the wonderful cosmic manifestation. Such transforma-
tions divide material nature into two features, namely the efficient and material
causes. The purusa, the enjoyer, is inactive and without material qualities, although
at the same time He is the master, existing separately in each and every body as the
emblem of knowledge. By understanding the material cause, one can guess that the
purusa, the enjoyer, being without activity, is aloof from all kinds of enjoyment or
superintendence. Sankhya philosophy, after describing the nature of prakrti (material
nature) and purusa (the enjoyer), asserts that the creation is only a product of their
unification or proximity to one another. With such unification the living symptoms
are visible in material nature, but one can guess that in the person of the enjoyer,
purusa, there are powers of control and enjoyment. When the purusa is illusioned
for want of sufficient knowledge, He feels Himself to be the enjoyer, and when He
is in full knowledge He is liberated. In the Sankhya philosophy the purusa is
described to be always indifferent to the activities of prakrti.

“The Sankhya philosopher accepts three kinds of evidences, namely direct per-
ception, hypothesis and traditional authority. When such evidence is complete,
everything is perfect. The process of comparison is within such perfection. Beyond
such evidence there is no proof. There is not much controversy regarding direct
perceptional evidence or authorized traditional evidence. The Sankhya system of
philosophy identifies three kinds of procedures—namely, parimandt (transformation),
samanvayat (adjustment) and Saktitah (performance of energies)—as the causes of
the cosmic manifestation.”

Srila Baladeva Vidyabhasana, in his commentary on the Vedanta-saitra, has tried
to nullify this conclusion because he thinks that discrediting these so-called causes
of the cosmic manifestation will nullify the entire Sankhya philosophy. Materialistic
philosophers accept matter to be the material and efficient cause of creation; for
them, matter is the cause of every type of manifestation. Generally they give the
example of a water pot and clay. Clay is the cause of the water pot, but the clay
can be found as both cause and effect. The water pot is the effect and clay itself is
the cause, but clay is visible everywhere. A tree is matter, but a tree produces fruit.
Water is matter, but water flows. In this way, say the Sarikhyites, matter is the
cause of movements and production. As such, matter can be considered the material
and efficient cause of everything in the cosmic manifestation. $rila Baladeva
Vidyabhisana has therefore enunciated the nature of pradhana as follows:

‘“Material nature is inert, and as such it cannot be the cause of matter, neither as
the material nor as the efficient cause. Seeing the wonderful arrangement and
management of the cosmic manifestation generally suggests that a living brain is
behind this arrangement, for without a living brain such an arrangement could not
exist. One should not imagine that such an arrangement can exist without conscious


--- Page 525 ---
Adi-fita, Chapter 6 527
direction. In our practical experience we never see that inert bricks can themselves
construct a big building.

“The example of the water pot cannot be accepted because a water pot has no
perception of pleasure and distress. Such perception is within. Therefore the covering
body, or the water pot, cannot be synchronized with it.

“Sometimes the material scientist suggests that trees grow from the earth auto-
matically, without assistance from a gardener, because that is a tendency of matter.
They also consider the intuition of living creatures from birth to be material. But
such material tendencies as bodily intuition cannot be accepted as independent, for
they suggest the existence of a spirit soul within the body. Actually, the tree or the
the body of 2 living creature has no tendency or intuition; the tendency and intuition
exist because the soul is present within the body. In this connection, the example of
a car and driver may be given very profitably. The car has a tendency to turn right
and left, but one cannot say that the car itself, as matter, turns right and left without
the direction of a driver. A material car has neither tendencies nor intuitions inde-
pendent of the intentions of the driver within the car. The same principle applies
for the automatic growth of trees in the forest. The growth takes place because of
the soul’s presence within the tree.

“Sometimes foolish people take for granted that because scorpions are born from
heaps of rice, the rice has produced the scorpions. The real fact, however, is that the
mother scorpion lays eggs within the rice, and by the proper fermentation of the
rice the eggs give birth to several baby scorpions, which in due course come out. This
does not mean that the rice gives birth to the scorpions. Similarly, sometimes bugs
are seen to come from dirty beds. This does not mean, however, that the beds give
birth to the bugs. It is the living soul that comes forth, taking advantage of the dirty
condition of the bed. There are different kinds of living creatures. Some of them
come from embryos, some from eggs and some from the fermentation of perspira-
tion. Different living creatures have different sources of appearance, but one should
not conclude that matter produces such living creatures.

“The example cited by materialists that trees automatically come from the earth
follows the same principle. Taking advantage of a certain condition, a living entity
comes from the earth. According to the Brhad-dranyaka Upanisad, every living being
is forced by divine superintendence to take a certain type of body according to his
past deeds. There are many varieties of bodies, and because of a divine arrangement
a living entity takes bodies of different shapes.

“When a person thinks, ^| am doing this,’ the ^| am’ does not refer to the body.
It refers to something more than the body, or within the body. As such, the body
as it is has neither tendencies nor intuition; the tendencies and intuition belong to
the soul within the body. Material scientists sometimes suggest that the tendencies
of male and female bodies cause their union and that this is the cause of the birth of
the child. But since the purusa, according to Sankhya philosophy, is always unaf-
fected, where does the tendency to give birth come from?

“Sometimes material scientists give the example that milk turns into curd auto-
matically and that distilled water pouring from the clouds falls down to earth,


--- Page 526 ---
528 $ri Caitanya-caritimrta
produces different kinds of trees, and enters different kinds of flowers and fruits
with different flavors and tastes. Therefore, they say, matter produces varieties of
material things on its own. In reply to this argument, the same proposition of the
Brhad-aranyaka Upanisad—that different kinds of living creatures are put into dif-
ferent kinds of bodies by the management of a superior power—is repeated. Under
superior superintendence, various souls, according to their past activities, are given
the chance to take a particular type of body, such as that of a tree, animal, bird or
beast, and thus their different tendencies develop under these circumstances.
Bhagavad-gita also further affirms:
purusah praRrti-stho hi
bhunkte prakrti-jan gunan
kdranarh guna-sango ‘sya
sad-asad-yoni-janmasu
‘The living entity in material nature follows the ways of life, enjoying the three
modes of nature. This is due to his association with that material nature. Thus he
meets with good and evil among various species.” (Bg. 13.22) The soul is given dif-
ferent types of bodies. For example, were souls not given varieties of tree bodies,
the different varieties of fruits and flowers could not be produced. Each class of
trees produce a particular kind of fruit and flower, it is not that there is no dis-
tinction between the different classes. An individual tree does not produce flowers
of different colors, nor fruits of different tastes. There are demarcated classes, as we
find them among humans, animals, birds and other species. There are innumerable
living entities, and their activities, performed in the material world according to the
different qualities of the material modes of nature, give them the chance to have
different kinds of life. Thus one should understand that pradhana, matter, cannot
act unless impelled by a living creature. The materialistic theory that matter inde-
pendently acts cannot, therefore, be accepted. Matter is called prakrti, which refers
to female energy. A woman is prakrti, a female. A female cannot produce a child,
without the association of a purusa, a man. The purusa causes the birth of a child
because the man injects the soul, which is sheltered in the semina, into the womb
of the woman. The woman, as the material cause, supplies the body of the soul,
and as the efficient cause she gives birth to the child. But although the woman ap-
pears to be the material and efficient cause of the birth of a child, originally the
purusa, the male, is the cause of the child. Similarly, this material world gives rise to
varieties of manifestations due to the entrance of Garbhodakasayi Visnu within the
universe. He is present not only within the universe but within the bodies of all
living creatures, as well as within the atom. We understand from the Brahma-
sarnhita that the Supersoul is present within the universe, within the atom and within
the heart of every living creature. Therefore the theory that matter is the cause of
the entire cosmic manifestation cannot be accepted by any man with sufficient
knowledge of matter and spirit.
“‘Materialists sometimes give the argument that as straw eaten by a cow produces
milk automatically, so material nature, under different circumstances, produces


--- Page 527 ---
Adi-fila, Chapter 6 529
varieties of manifestations. Thus originally matter is the cause. In refuting this
argument, we may say that an animal of the same species as the cow—namely, the
bull—also eats straw like the cow but does not produce milk. Under the circum-
stances, it cannot be said that straw in connection with a particular species produces
milk. The conclusion should be that there is superior management, as confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita (9.10), where the Lord says, mayadhyaksena prakrtih 50%016 sa-
cardcaram: ‘This material nature is working under My direction, 0 son of Kunti,
and it is producing all moving and unmoving beings.” The Supreme Lord says,
mayadhyaksena (‘under My superintendence’). When He desires that the cow
produce milk by eating straw, there is milk, and when He does not so desire it, the
mixture of such straw cannot produce milk. If the way of material nature had been
that straw produced milk, a stack of straw could also produce milk. But that is not
possible. And the same straw given to a human female also cannot produce milk.
That is the meaning of Bhagavad-gita’s statement that only under superior orders
does anything take place. Matter itself has no power to produce independently. The
conclusion, therefore, is that matter, which has no self-knowledge, cannot be the
cause of the material creation. The ultimate creator is the Supreme Personality of
Godhead.

“If matter were accepted as the original cause of creation, all the authorized
scriptures in the world would be useless, for in every scripture, especially the Vedic
scriptures like the Manu-smrti, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is said to be
the ultimate creator. The Manu-smrti is considered the highest Vedic direction to
humanity. Manu is the giver of law to mankind, and in the Manu-smrti it is clearly
stated that before the creation the entire universal space was darkness, without
information and without variety, and was in a state of complete suspension, like
a dream. Everything was darkness. The Supreme Personality of Godhead then
entered the universal space, and although He is invisible, He created the visible
cosmic manifestation. In the material world the Supreme Personality of Godhead
is not manifested by His personal presence, but the presence of the cosmic mani-
festation in different varieties is the proof that everything has been created under
His direction. He entered the universe with all creative potencies, and thus He
removed the darkness of the unlimited space.

“The form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is described to be transcen-
dental, very subtle, eternal, all-pervading, inconceivable and therefore nonmanifested
to the material senses of a conditioned living creature. He desired to expand Himself
into many living entities, and with such a desire He first created a vast expanse of
water within the universal space and then impregnated that water with living en-
tities. By that process of impregnation a massive body appeared, blazing like a
thousand suns, and in that body was the first creative principle, Brahma. The great
Parasara Rsi has also confirmed this in the Visnu Purana. He says that the cosmic
manifestation visible to us is produced from Lord Visnu and sustained under His
protection. He is the principal maintainer and destroyer of the universal form.

“This cosmic manifestation is one of the diverse energies of the Supreme Person-
ality of Godhead. As a spider secretes saliva and weaves a web by its own movements
but at the end winds the web within its body, so Lord Visnu produces this cosmic


--- Page 528 ---
530 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta

manifestation from His transcendental body and at the end winds it up within
Himself. All the great sages of the Vedic understanding have accepted that the
Supreme Personality of Godhead is the original creator.

“It is sometimes claimed that the impersonal speculations of great philosophers
are meant for the advancement of knowledge without religious ritualistic principles.
But the religious ritualistic principles are actually meant for the advancement of
spiritual knowledge. By performance of religious rituals one ultimately reaches the
supreme goal of knowledge by understanding that Vasudeva, the Supreme Person-
ality of Godhead, is the cause of everything. It is clearly stated in Bhagavad-gita
that even those who are advocates of knowledge only, without any religious
ritualistic processes, advance in knowledge after many, many lifetimes of specu-
lation and thus come to the conclusion that Vasudeva is the supreme cause of every-
thing that be. As a result of this achievement of the goal of life, such an advanced
learned scholar or philosopher surrenders unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Religious ritualistic performances are actually meant to cleanse the contaminated
mind in the material world, and the special feature of this age of Kali is that one
can easily execute the process of cleansing the mind of contamination by chanting
the holy names of God—Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare.

“A Vedic injunction states, sarve veda yat padamananti: all Vedic knowledge is
searching after the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly, another Vedic in-
junction states, ndrayana-para vedah: the Vedas are meant for understanding
Narayana, the Supreme Lord. Similarly, Bhagavad-gita also confirms, vedai§ ca
sarvair aham eva vedyah: by all the Vedas, Krsna is to be known. Therefore, the
main purpose of understanding the Vedas, performing Vedic sacrifices and specu-
lating on the Vedanta-sitras is to understand Krsna. Accepting the impersonalist
view of voidness or the nonexistence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead ne-
gates all study of the Vedas. Impersonal speculation aims at disproving the con-
clusion of the Vedas. Therefore any impersonal speculative presentation should be
understood to be against the principles of the Vedas or standard scriptures. Since
the speculation of the impersonalists does not follow the principles of the Vedas,
their conclusion must be considered to be against the Vedic principles. Anything
not supported by the Vedic principles must be considered imaginary and lacking
in standard proof. Therefore no impersonalist explanation of any Vedic literature
can be accepted.

“If one tries to nullify the conclusions of the Vedas by acceptingan unauthorized
scripture or so-called scripture, it will be very hard for him to come to the right
conclusion about the Absolute Truth. The system for adjusting two contradictory
scriptures is to refer to the Vedas, for references from the Vedas are accepted as
final judgments. When we refer to a particular scripture, it must be authorized, and
for this authority it must strictly follow the Vedic injunctions. If someone presents
an alternative doctrine he himself has manufactured, that doctrine will prove itself
useless, for any doctrine that tries to prove that Vedic evidence is meaningless
immediately proves itself meaningless. The followers of the Vedas unanimously
accept the authority of Manu and Parasara in the disciplic succession. Their state-


--- Page 529 ---
Adi-lita, Chapter 6 531
ments, however, do not support the atheistic Kapila because the Kapila mentioned
in the Vedas is a different Kapila, the son of Kardama and Devahti. The atheist
Kapila is a descendant of the dynasty of Agni and is one of the conditioned souls.
But the Kapila who is the son of Kardama Muni is accepted as an incarnation of
Vasudeva. The Padma Purdapa gives evidence that the Supreme Personality of
Godhead Vasudeva takesbirth in the incarnation of Kapila and, by His expansion of
theistic Sankhya philosophy, teaches all the demigods and a brahmana of the name
Asuri. In the doctrine of the atheist Kapila there are many statements directly against
the Vedic principles. The atheist Kapila does not accept the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. He says that the living entity is himself the Supreme Lord and that no one
is greater than him. His conceptions of so-called conditional and liberated life are
materialistic, and he refuses to accept the importance of immortal time. All such
statements are against the principles of the Vedanta-satras.”

“O Lord of lords, You are the seer of all creation. You are indeed everyone's

Narayana is Your plenary portion. All Your plenary portions are transcendental.
They are absolute and are not creations of maya.”

Lord Krsna; kari’—making; ddna—gift; gitd-bhagavate—in Bhagavad-gitd and Srimad-

TRANSLATION
He delivered all living beings by offering the gift of krsna-bhakti. He explained
Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam in the light of devotional service.
PURPORT
Although ও Advaita Prabhu is an incarnation of Visnu, for the welfare of the
conditioned souls He manifested Himself as a servitor of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, and throughout all His activities He showed Himself to be an eternal
servitor. Lord Caitanya and Lord Nityananda also manifested the same principle,
although They also belong to the category of Vispu. If Lord Caitanya, Lord
Nityananda and Advaita Prabhu had exhibited Their all-powerful Visnu potencies
within this material world, people would have become greater impersonalists,
monists and self-worshipers than they had already become under the spell of this
age. Therefore the Personality of Godhead and His different incarnations and forms
played the parts of devotees to instruct the conditioned souls how to approach the
transcendental stage of devotional service. Advaita Acirya especially intended to
teach the conditioned souls about devotional service. The word dcarya means
“teacher.” The special function of such a teacher is to make people Krsna conscious.
A bona fide teacher following in the footsteps of Advaita Acarya has no other busi-
ness than to spread the principles of Krsna consciousness all over the world. The real
qualification of an dcdrya is that he presents himself as a servant of the Supreme.


--- Page 535 ---
Adi-fila, Chapter 6 537
Such a bona fide dcarya can never support the demoniac activities of atheistic men
who present themselves as God. It is the main business of an dcarya to defy such
imposters posing as God before the innocent public.

PURPORT
€ Advaita Acarya is the prime spiritual master of the Vaisnavas, and He is
worshipable by all Vaisnavas. Devotees and Vaisnavas must follow in the footsteps
of Advaita Acirya, for by so doing one can actually engage in the devotional service
of the Lord.

TRANSLATION
Thinking, “He [$ri Advaita Acarya] is a disciple of $ri Madhavendra Puri,” Lord
Caitanya obeys Him, respecting Him as His spiritual master.
PURPORT
Sri Madhavendra Puri is one of the dcdryas in the disciplic succession from
Madhvacarya. Madhavendra Puri had two principal disciples, Tévara Puri and Set
Advaita Prabhu. Therefore the Gaudiya-Vaisnava-sampradaya is a disciplic succes-
sion from Madhvacarya. This fact has been accepted in the authorized books known
as Gaura-ganoddesa-dipika and Prameya-ratnavali, as well as by Gopala Guru
Gosvami. The Gaura-ganoddesa-dipika clearly states the disciplic succession of the
Gaudiya Vaisnavas as follows: “Lord Brahma is the direct disciple of Visnu, the
Lord of the spiritual sky. His disciple is Narada, Narada’s disciple is Vyasa, and
Vyasa’s disciples are Sukadeva Gosvami and Madhvacarya. Padmanabha Acirya is
the disciple of Madhviaciarya, and Narahari is the disciple of Padmanabha Acarya.
Madhava is the disciple of Narahari, Aksobhya is the direct disciple of Madhava,
and Jayatirtha is the disciple of Aksobhya. Jayatirtha’s disciple is Jiianasindhu, and
his disciple is Mahanidhi. Vidyanidhi is the disciple of Mahanidhi, and Rajendra is
the disciple of Vidyanidhi. Jayadharma is the disciple of Rajendra. Purusottama is
the disciple of Jayadharma. Sriman Laksmipati is the disciple of Vyasatirtha, who
is the disciple of Purugsottama. And Madhavendra Puri is the disciple of Laksmipati.”

TRANSLATION
Sri Advaita Acirya, however, considers Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu His master,
and He thinks of Himself as a servant of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu.
PURPORT
The Bhakti-rasamyrta-sindhu of Rupa Gosvami explains the superexcellent quality
of devotional service as follows:
brahmanando bhaved esa
cet parardha-gunikrtah
naiti bhakti-sukhambhodheh
paramanu-tulam api
“If multiplied billions of times, the transcendental pleasure derived from impersonal
Brahman realization still could not compare to even an atomic portion of the ocean
of bhakti, or transcendental service.” (B.r.s. 1.1.38) Similarly, the Bhavartha-dipika
states:
tvat-kathamyta-pathodhau
viharanto maha-mudah
kurvanti Rrtinah kecic
catur-vargari trpopamam
“For those who take pleasure in the transcendental topics of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, the four progressive realizations of religiosity, economic development,
sense gratification and liberation, all combined together, cannot compare, any more
than a straw, to the happiness derived from hearing about the transcendental activi-
ties of the Lord.” Those who engage in the transcendental service of the lotus feet
of Krsna, being relieved of all material enjoyment, have no attraction to topics of
impersonal monism. In the Padma Purana, in connection with the glorification of
the month of Karttika, it is stated that devotees pray:
vararh deva moksarh na moksavadhiri va
na canyarn ৮[06 ’hari varesad apiha


--- Page 542 ---
544 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta

“Dear Lord, always remembering Your childhood pastimes at Vrndavana is better
for us than aspiring to merge into the impersonal Brahman. During Your childhood
pastimes You liberated the two sons of Kuvera and made them great devotees of
Your Lordship. Similarly, | wish that instead of giving me liberation You may
award me such devotion unto You.” In the Hayasirsiya-$ri-narayana-vyaha-stava, in
the chapter called Narayana-stotra, it is stated:
na dharmarih kamam artharir va
moksari va varade$vara
prarthaye tava padabje
dasyam evabhikamaye
“My dear Lord, | do not wish to become a man of religion nor a master of economic
development or sense gratification, nor do | wish for liberation. Although | can
have all these from You, the supreme benedictor, | do not pray for all these. | simply
pray that | may always be engaged as a servant of Your lotus feet.” Nrsimhadeva
offered Prahlada Maharaja all kinds of benedictions, but Prahlada Maharaja did not
accept any of them, for he simply wanted to engage in the service of the lotus feet
of the Lord. Similarly, a pure devotee wishes to be blessed likeiMaharaja Prahlada
by being thus endowed with devotional service. Devotees also offer their respects to
Hanuman, who always remained a servant of Lord Rama. The great devotee
Hanuman prayed:
bhava-bandha-cchide tasyai
sprhayami na muktaye
bhavan prabhur aharh dasa
iti yatra vilupyate
“I do not wish to take liberation or to merge in the Brahman effulgence, where the
conception of being a servant of the Lord is completely lost.” Similarly, in the
Narada-pancaratra it is stated:
dharmartha-kama-moksesu
neccha mama kadacana
tvat-pada-pankajasyadho
/7\4110/7 diyatarin mama


--- Page 543 ---
Adi-lila, Chapter 6 545
“I do not want any one of the four desirable stations. | simply want to engage as a
servant of the lotus feet of the Lord.” King Kulasekhara, in his very famous book
Mukunda-mala-stotra, prays:
naham vande pada-kamalayor dvandvam advandva-hetoh
kumbhi-pakarn gurum api hare narakam napanetum
ramyad-rama-mydu-tanu-lata-nandane nabhiranturi
bhave bhave hrdaya-bhavane 800৮0) 6) 0/77 bhavantam
“My Lord, | do not worship You to be liberated from this material entanglement,
nor do | wish to save myself from the hellish condition of material existence, nor do
| ever pray for a beautiful wife to enjoy in a nice garden. | wish only that | may
always be in full ecstasy with the pleasure of serving Your Lordship.” (M.m.s. 6) In
Srimad-Bhagavatam also there are many instances in the Third and Fourth Cantos
in which devotees pray to the Lord simply to be engaged in His service, and nothing
else (Bhag. 3.4.15, 3.25.34, 3.25.36, 4.1.22, 4.9.10 and 4.20.24).

PURPORT

The transcendental devotional service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is
so ecstatic that even the Lord Himself plays the part of a devotee. Forgetting
Himself to be the Supreme, He personally teaches the whole world how to render
service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

550 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta
Godhead of those engaged in pafnicaratrika regulative principles depends more or
less on the opulent and reverential platform, but the worship of Radha and Krsna
is purely on the platform of transcendental love. Even persons who play as the
superiors of Krsna also take the chance to offer transcendental loving service to the
Lord. The service attitude of the devotees who play the parts of superiors of the
Lord is very difficult to understand, but can be very plainly understood in connec-
tion with the superexcellence of their particular service to Lord Krsna. A vivid
example is the service of mother Yasoda to Krsna, which is distinct. In the feature
of Narayana, the Lord can accept services only from His associates who play parts
in which they are equal to or less than Him, but in the feature of Lord Krspa He
accepts service very plainly from His fathers, teachers and other elders who are
His superiors, as well as from His equals and His subordinates. This is very wonderful

Adi-lila, Chapter 6 561
PURPORT
Although Lord Baladeva appeared before the birth of Lord Krsna and is therefore
Krsna’s worshipable elder brother, He used to act 25 Krsna’s eternal servitor. In the
spiritual sky all the Vaikuntha planets are predominated by the quadruple expan-
sions of Krsna known as the catur-vyiiha. They are direct expansions from Baladeva.
It is the singularity of the Supreme Lord that everyone in the spiritual sky thinks
himself a servitor of the Lord. According to social convention one may be superior
to Krsna, but factually everyone engages in His service. Therefore in the spiritual
sky or the material sky, in all the different planets, no one is able to supersede Lord
Krsna or demand service from Him. On the contrary, everyone engages in the
service of Lord Krsna. As such, the more a person engages in the service of the
Lord, the more he is important; and, conversely, the more one is bereft of the
transcendental service of Krsna, the more he invites the bad fortune of material
contamination. In the material world, although materialists want to become one
with God or compete with God, everyone directly or indirectly engages in the ser-
vice of the Lord. The more one is forgetful of the service of Krsna, the more he is
considered to be dying. Therefore, when one develops pure Krsna consciousness, he

ananta brahmande rudra——sadasivera armsa
gundvatdra tenho, sarva-deva-avatarinsa
SYNONYMS
ananta—unlimited; brahmande—in the universes; rudra—Lord Siva; sadasivera
arh$a—part and parcel of Sadasiva; guna-avatara—an incarnation of a quality; tenho
—he also; sarva-deva-avatariisa—the ornament of all the demigods.
TRANSLATION
Rudra, who is an expansion of Sadasiva and who appears in unlimited universes,
is also a gunavatara [qualitative incarnation] and is the ornament of all the demi-
gods in the endless universes.
PURPORT
There are eleven expansions of Rudra, or Lord Siva. They are as follows: Ajaikapat,
Ahibradhna, Virtipaksa, Raivata, Hara, Bahurlpa, Devasrestha Tryambaka, Savitra,
Jayanta, Pinaki and Aparajita. Besides these expansions there are eight forms of
Rudra called earth, water, fire, air, sky, the sun, the moon and soma-ydji. Generally
all these Rudras have five faces, three eyes and ten arms. Sometimes it is found that
Rudra is compared to Brahma and considered a living entity. But when Rudra 15,
explained to be a partial expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is
compared to Sesa. Lord Siva is therefore simultaneously an expansion of Lord
Visnu and, in his capacity for annihilating the creation, one of the living entities. As
an expansion of Lord Visnu he is called Hara, and he is transcendental to the ma-
terial qualities, but when he is in touch with tamo-guna he appears contaminated


--- Page 561 ---
Adi-fila, Chapter 6 563
by the material modes of nature. This is explained in the Srimad-Bhdgavatam and
the Brahma-sarihita. In the Srimad-Bhagavatam, Tenth Canto, it is stated that Lord
Rudra is always associated with the material nature when she is in the neutral, un-
manifested stage, but when the modes of material nature are agitated he associates
with material nature from a distance. In the Brahma-sarihita the relationship be-
tween Visnu and Lord Siva is compared to that of milk and yogurt. Milk is con-
verted into yogurt by certain additives, but although milk and yogurt have the same
ingredients, they have different functions. Similarly, Lord Siva is an expansion of
Lord Visnu, yet because of his taking part in the annihilation of the cosmic mani-
festation, he is considered to be changed, like milk converted into yogurt. In the
Puranas it is found that Durga appears sometimes from the heads of Brahma and
sometimes from the heads of Visnu. The annihilator, Rudra, is born from Sarikarsana
and the ultimate fire to burn the whole creation. In the Vayu Purana there is a de-
scription of Sadasiva in one of the Vaikuntha planets. That Sadasiva is a direct
expansion of Lord Krsna’s form for pastimes. It is said that Sadasiva (Lord Sambhu)
is an expansion from the Sadasiva in the Vaikuntha planets (Lord Visnu) and that
his consort, mahamaya, is an expansion of Ramadevi, or Laksmi. Mahamaya is the
origin or birthplace of material nature.

Some accept Him whereas others do not, yet everyone is His servant. One who

PURPORT
When a living entity forgets his constitutional position, he prepares himself to be
anenjoyer of the material resources. Sometimes he is also misguided by the thought
that service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead is not absolute engagement. In
other words, he thinks that there are many other engagements for a living entity
besides the service of the Lord. Such a foolish person does not know that in any
position he either directly or indirectly engages in activities of service to the
Supreme Lord. Actually, if a person does not engage in the service of the Lord, all


--- Page 564 ---
566 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta
inauspicious activities encumber him because service to the Supreme Lord, Lord
Caitanya, is the constitutional position of the infinitesimal living entities. Because
the living entity is infinitesimal, the allurement of material enjoyment attracts him,
and he tries to enjoy matter, forgetting his constitutional position. But when his
dormant Krsna consciousness is awakened, he no longer engages in the service of
matter but engages in the service of the Lord. In other words, when one is for-
getful of his constitutional position, he appears in the position of the lord of
material nature. Even at that time he remains a servant of the Supreme Lord, but in
an unqualified or contaminated state.

The scriptures call them incarnations as devotees [bhakta-avatara]. The position

PURPORT
The Supreme Personality of Godhead appears in different incarnations, but His
appearance in the role of a devotee is more beneficial to the conditioned souls than
the other incarnations, with all their opulences. Sometimes a conditioned soul is
bewildered when he tries to understand the incarnation of Godhead with full


--- Page 569 ---
Adi-lila, Chapter 6 571
opulence. Lord Krsna appeared and performed many uncommon activities, and
some materialists misunderstood Him, but in His appearance as Lord Caitanya He
did not show much of His opulences, and therefore fewer conditioned souls were
bewildered. Misunderstanding the Lord, many fools consider themselves incarna-
tions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the result is that after leaving the
material body they enter the species of jackals. Persons who cannot understand the
real significance of an incarnation must attain such lower species of life as punish-
ment. Conditioned souls who are puffed up by false egoism and who try to become
one with the Supreme Lord become Mayavadis.

PURPORT
A fraction of a particular thing is called a part, and that from which the fraction
is distinguished is called the whole. Therefore the fraction, or part, is included
within the whole. The Lord is the whole, and the devotee is the part or fractional
part. That is the relationship between the Lord and the devotee. There are also
gradations of devotees, who are calculated as greater and lesser. When a devotee is
great he is called prabhu, and when he is lesser he is called bhakta, or a devotee.
The supreme whole is Krsna, and Baladeva and all Visnu incarnations are His frac-
tions. Lord Krsna is therefore conscious of His superior position, and all Visnu
incarnations are conscious of Their positions as devotees.

devotees than to His personal self. In Srimad-Bhagavatam (9.4.68) the Lord clearly
says:

When a person is liberated in the saripya form of liberation, having a spiritual
form exactly like Visnu, it is not possible for him to relish the relationship of
Krsna’s personal associates in their mellow exchanges. The devotees of Krsna,
however, in their loving relationships with Krsna, sometimes forget their own
identities; sometimes they think themselves one with Krsna and yet relish still
greater transcendental mellow in that way. People in general, because of their


--- Page 573 ---
Adi-ila, Chapter 6 575
foolishness only, try to become masters of everything, forgetting the transcendental
mellow of servitorship to the Lord. When a person is actually advanced in spiritual
understanding, however, he can accept the transcendental servitorship of the Lord
without hesitation.

Although Sr Advaita Prabhu belongs to the Visnu category, He displays servitor-
ship to Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu as one of His associates. When Lord Visnu

Vaikuntha, is the chief of the quadruple incarnations and is the original incarnation
of a devotee. Lord Maha-Visnu, who is lying on the Causal Ocean, is another
manifestation of Sankarsana. He is the original Personality of Godhead who glances
over the material and efficient causes of the cosmic manifestation. Advaita Prabhu
is accepted as an incarnation of Maha-Visnu. All the plenary manifestations of
Sankarsana are indirect expansions of Lord Krsna. That consideration also makes
Advaita Prabhu an eternal servitor of Gaura Krsna. Therefore He is accepted as a
devotee incarnation.
