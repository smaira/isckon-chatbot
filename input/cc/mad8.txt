Introduction

न Caitanya-caritamyta is the principal work on the life and teachings of Sri
Krsna Caitanya. Sri Caitanya is the pioneer of a great social and religious move-
ment which began in India a little less than five hundred years ago and which has
directly ard indirectly influenced the subsequent course of religious and phi-
losophical thinking not only in India but in the recent West as well.

Caitanya Mahaprabhu is regarded as a figure of great historical significance.
However, our conventional method of historical analysis—that of seeing a man as
a product of his times —fails here. ঠা] Caitanya is a personality who transcends the
limited scope of historical settings.

At a time when, in the West, man was directing his explorative spirit toward
studying the structure of the physical universe and circumnavigating the world in
search of new oceans and continents, Si Krsna Caitanya, in the East, was in-
augurating and masterminding a revolution directed inward, toward a scientific
understanding of the highest knowledge of man’s spiritual nature.

The chief historical sources for the life of $rf Krsna Caitanya are the kadacas (di-
aries) kept by Murari Gupta and 53103 Damodara Gosvami. Murari Gupta, a
physician and close associate of Sri Caitanya’s, recorded extensive notes on the
first twenty-four years of Sri Caitanya'’s life, culminating in his initiation into the
renounced order, sannyasa. The events of the rest of Caitanya Mahaprabhu'’s for-
ty-eight years are recorded in the diary of Svaripa Damodora Gosvami, another of
Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s intimate associates.

Sri Caitanya-caritamrta is divided into three sections called 1135, which literally
means “pastimes” — 440 -111 (the early period), Madhya-lila (the middle period)
and Antya-lila (the final period). The notes of Murari Gupta form the basis of the
Adi-lila, and SvarGpa Damodara’s diary provides the details for the Madhya- and
Antya-lilas.

The first twelve of the seventeen chapters of Adi-lila constitute the preface for
the entire work. By referring to Vedic scriptural evidence, this preface establishes
$ri Caitanya as the avatara (incarnation) of Krsna (God) for the age of Kali—the
current epoch, beginning five thousand years ago and characterized by material-
ism, hypocrisy and dissension. In these descriptions, Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who
is identical with Lord Krsna, descends to liberally grant pure love of God to the
fallen souls of this degraded age by propagating sankirtana—literally,
“congregational glorification of God” —especially by organizing massive public
chanting of the maha-mantra (Great Chant for Deliverance). The esoteric purpose
of Lord Caitanya’s appearance in the world is revealed, his co-avataras and prin-
cipal devotees are described and his teachings are summarized. The remaining
portion of Adi-lili, chapters thirteen through seventeen, briefly recounts his
divine birth and his life until he accepted the renounced order. This includes his
childhood miracles, schooling, marriage and early philosophical confrontations, as
well as his organization of a widespread sarikirtana movement and his civil disobe-
dience against the repression of the Mohammedan government.

$ri Caitanya-caritamrta

The subject of Madhya-lila, the longest of the three divisions, is a detailed nar-
ration of Lord Caitanya’s extensive and eventful travels throughout India as a
renounced mendicant, teacher, philosopher, spiritual preceptor and mystic. Dur-
ing this period of six years, $rf Caitanya transmits his teachings to his principal dis-
ciples. He debates and converts many of the most renowned philosophers and
theologians of his time, including Sankarites, Buddhists and Muslims, and incor-
porates their many thousands of followers and disciples into his own burgeoning
numbers. A dramatic account of Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s miraculous activities at
the giant Jagannatha Cart Festival in Orissa is also included in this section.

Antya-lila concerns the last eighteen years of $f Caitanya’s manifest presence,
spent in semiseclusion near the famous Jagannatha temple at Jagannatha Puri in
Orissa. During these final years, ना Caitanya drifted deeper and deeper into
trances of spiritual ecstasy unparalleled in all of religious and literary history,
Eastern or Western. $i Caitanya’s perpetual and ever-increasing religious
beatitude, graphically described in the eyewitness accounts of Svaripa Damodara
Gosvami, his constant companion during this period, clearly defy the investigative
and descriptive abilities of modern psychologists and phenomenologists of
religious experience.

The author of this great classic, Krsnadasa Kavirdja Gosvami, born in the year
1507, was a disciple of Raghunatha dasa Gosvami, a confidential follower of
Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Raghunatha dasa, a renowned ascetic saint, heard and
memorized all the activities of Caitanya Mahaprabhu told to him by Svartipa
Damodara. After the passing away of अ Caitanya and Svaripa Damodara,
Raghunatha dasa, unable to bear the pain of separation from these objects of his
complete devotion, traveled to Vindavana, intending to commit suicide by jump-
ing from Govardhana Hill. In Vrndavana, however, he encountered Ripa Gosvami
and Sanatana Gosvami, the most confidential disciples of Caitanya Mahaprabhu.
They convinced him to give up his plan of suicide and impelled him to reveal to
them the spiritually inspiring events of Lord Caitanya's later life. Krsnadasa Kaviraja
Gosvami was also residing in Vrndavana at this time, and Raghunatha dasa
Gosvami endowed him with a full comprehension of the transcendental life of भ
Caitanya.

By this time, several biographical works had already been written on the life of
$i Caitanya by contemporary and near-contemporary scholars and devotees.
These included $/1 Caitanya-caritaby Murari Gupta, Caitanya-marigala by Locana
dasa Thakura and Caitanya-bhagavata. This latter text, ৪ work by Vrndavana dasa
Thakura, who was then considered the principal authority on $ri Caitanya'’s life,
was highly revered. While composing his important work, Vindavana dasa, fearing
that it would become too voluminous, avoided elaborately describing many of
the events of 5 Caitanya’s life, particulary the later ones. Anxious to hear of these
later pastimes, the devotees of Vindavana requested Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami,
whom they respected as a great saint, to compose a book to narrate these

vii

$ri Caitanya-caritimrta
episodes in detail. Upon this request, and with the permission and blessings of the
Madana-mohana Deity of Vrndavana, he began compiling $ri Caitanya-caritamrta,
which, due to its biographical excellence and thorough exposition of Lord
Caitanya’s profound philosophy and teachings, is regarded as the most significant
of biographical works on $i Caitanya.

He commenced work on the text while in his late nineties and in failing health,
as he vividly describes in the text itself: “I have now become too old and dis-
turbed in invalidity. While writing, my hands tremble. | cannot remember any-
thing, nor can | see or hear properly. Still | write, and this is a great wonder.” That
he nevertheless completed, under such debilitating conditions, the greatest liter-
ary gem of medieval India is surely one of the wonders of literary history.

This English translation and commentary is the work of His Divine Grace A.C.
Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the world’s most distinguished teacher of In-
dian religious and philosophical thought. His commentary is based upon two
Bengali commentaries, one by his teacher Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvam,
the emiment Vedic scholar who predicted, “The time will come when the people
of the world will learn Bengali to read $ri Caitanya-caritamrta,” and the other by
Srila Bhaktisiddhanta’s father, Bhaktivinoda Thakura.

His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada is himself a disciplic
descendant of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and he is the first scholar to execute
systematic English translations of the major works of Sri Caitanya'’s followers. His
consummate Bengali and Sanskrit scholarship and intimate familiarity with the
precepts of Sti Krsna Caitanya are a fitting combination that eminently qualifies
him to present this important classic to the English-speaking world. The ease and
clarity with which he expounds upon difficult philosophical concepts lures even a
reader totally unfamiliar with Indian religious tradition into a genuine understand-
ing and appreciation of this profound and monumental work.

The entire text, with commentary, presented in seventeen lavishly illustrated
volumes by the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, represents a contribution of major im-
portance to the intellectual, cultural and spiritual life of contemporary man.

CHAPTER 20
Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu
Instructs Sanatana Gosvami in the
Science of the Absolute Truth

The following summary study of this chapter is given by Bhaktivinoda Thakura in
his Amrta-pravaha-bhasya. When Srila Sanatana Gosvami was imprisoned by
Nawab Hussain Shah, he received news from Rapa Gosvami that Sr Caitanya
Mahaprabhu had gone to Mathura. Sanatana Gosvami thereafter satisfied the
superintendent of the jail by sweet solicitations and bribery. After giving the jailer
seven thousand gold coins, Sanatana Gosvami was released. He then crossed the
Ganges and fled. One of his servants, Téana, followed him, carrying eight gold
coins. Sanatana Gosvami and his servant then spent the night in a small hotel on
the way to Benares. The hotel owner knew that Sanatana Gosvami and his servant
had eight gold coins, and he decided to kill them and take the money. Making
plans in this way, the hotel owner received them as honorable guests. Sanatana
Gosvami, however, asked his servant how much money he had, and, taking seven
of the gold coins, Sanatana offered them to the hotel owner. Thus the owner
helped them reach the hilly tract toward Varanasi. On the way, Sanatana Gosvami
met his brother-in-law, Srikanta, at Hajipura, and $rikanta helped him after he had
heard about all Sanatana’s troubles. Thus Sanatana Gosvami finally arrived at
Varanasi and stood before the door of Candrasekhara. Caitanya Mahaprabhu
called him in and ordered him to change his dress so that he could look like a
gentleman. For his garment, he used an old cloth of Tapana Misra’s. Later, he ex-
changed his valuable blanket for a torn quilt. At this time Caitanya Mahaprabhu
was very pleased with him, and thus Sri Sanatana Gosvami received knowledge of
the Absolute Truth from the Lord Himself.

First they discussed the constitutional position of the living entities, and $ri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu explained to Sanatana Gosvami how the living entity is one
of Lord Krsna's energies. After this, the Lord explained the way of devotional ser-
vice. While discussing the Absolute Truth, Sri Krsna, the Lord analyzed Brahman,
Paramatma and Bhagavan, as well 25 the expansions of the Lord called svayarn-
rapa, tad-ekatma and dvesa, which are divided into various branches known as
vaibhava and prabhava. Thus the Lord described the many forms of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. He also described the incarnations of God within the ma-
terial world, incarnations such as the purusa-avataras, manvantara-avatdras, guna-
avataras and saktydvesa-avatdras. The Lord also discussed the divisions of Krsna's

1

different ages, such as balya and pauganda, and the different pastimes of the dif-
ferent ages. He explained how Krsna attained His permanent form when He
reached youth. In this way Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu explained and described
everything to Sanatana Cosvami.

bondage; tiare—him; mukta karena—releases; gosana—the Supreme Personality
of Godhead.
TRANSLATION
‘If one releases a conditioned soul or imprisoned person according to
religious principles, he himself is alse released from material bondage by the
Supreme Personality of Godhead.”
PURPORT
It appears from this statement that Sanatana Gosvami, who was formerly a
minister of the Nawab, was trying to cheat the Mohammedan superintendent. A
jail superintendent had only an ordinary education, or practically no education,
and he was certainly not supposed to be very advanced in spiritual knowledge
However, just to satisfy him, Sanatana Gosvami praised him as a very learned
scholar of the scriptures. The jailkeeper could not deny that he was a learned
scholar because when one is elevated to an exalted position, one thinks oneself fit
for that position. Saniatana Gosvami was correctly explaining the effects of
spiritual activity, and the jailkeeper connected his statement with his release from
jail. There are innumerable conditioned souls rotting in the material world, im-
prisoned by maya under the spell of sense gratification. The living entity is so en-
tranced by the spell of maya that in conditioned life even a pig feels satisfied.
There are two kinds of covering powers exhibited by maya. One is called prak-
sepatmika, and the other is called avaranatmika. When one is determined to get
out of material bondage, the praksepatmika-sakti, the spell of diversion, impels
one to remain in conditioned life fully satisfied by sense gratification. Due to the
other power (avaranatmika), a conditioned soul feels satisfied even if he is rotting
in the body of a pig or a worm in stool. To release a conditioned soul from ma-
terial bondage is very difficult because the spell of maya is so strong. Even when
the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself descends to deliver conditioned
souls, asking them to surrender unto Him, the conditioned souls do not agree to
the Lord's proposals. Therefore $ri Sanatana Gosvami said, “Somehow or other, if
one helps another gain release from the bondage of maya, he is certainly recog-
nized immediately by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.” As stated in
Bhagavad-gita (18.69):
na ca tasman manusyesu
kascin me priya-krttamah
bhavita na ca me tasmad
anyah priyataro bhuvi
The greatest service one can render to the Lord is to try to infuse devotional ser-
vice into the heart of the conditioned soul so that the conditioned soul may be
released from conditional life. Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura has said that a Vaisnava


--- Page 9 ---
6 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 20
is recognized by his preaching work—that is, by convincing the conditioned soul
about his eternal position, which is explained here as nija-dharma. It is the living
entity's eternal position to serve the Lord; therefore to help one get release from
material bondage is to awaken one to the dormant understanding that he is the
eternal servant of Krsna. Jivera ‘svartipa’ haya——krsnera ‘nitya-dasa’. This will be
further explained by the Lord Himself to Sanatana Gosvami.

tirthi-kurvanti—make into holy places; tirthani—all the holy places of pilgrimage;

carries a club.
TRANSLATION
^“ ‘Saints of your caliber are themselves places of pilgrimage. Because of
their purity, they are constant companions of the Lord, and therefore they can
purify even the places of pilgrimage.’
PURPORT
This verse was spoken by Maharaja Yudhisthira to Vidura in Srimad-Bhagavatam
(1.13.10). Vidura was returning home after visiting sacred places of pilgrimage,
and Maharaja Yudhisthira was receiving his saintly uncle. In essence, Maharaja
Yudhisthira was saying, “My dear Lord Vidura, you yourself are a holy place be-


--- Page 31 ---
28 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 20
cause you are an advanced devotee. People like you always carry Lord Visnu in
their hearts. You can revitalize all holy places after they have been polluted by the
pilgrimages of sinners.”

A sinful person goes to a holy place of pilgrimage to be purified. In a holy place,
there are many saintly people and temples of Lord Visnu; however, the holy place
becomes infected with the sins of many visitors. When an advanced devotee
goes to a holy place, he counteracts all the sins of the pilgrims. Therefore Maha-
raja Yudisthira addressed Vidura in this way.

Since an advanced devotee carries Lord Visnu within his heart, he is a moving
temple and a moving Visnu. An advanced devotee does not need to go to holy
places, for wherever he stays is a holy place. In this connection, Narottama dasa
Thakura states, tirtha-ydtra parisrama, kevala manera bhrama: visiting holy places
is simply another type of bewilderment. Since an advanced devotee does not
need to go to a holy place, why does he go? The answer is that he goes simply to
purify the place.

^“ ‘Even though a person is a very learned scholar of the Sanskrit Vedic
literatures, he is not accepted as My devotee unless he is pure in devotional
service. However, even though a person is born in a family of dog-eaters, he is
very dear to Me if he is a pure devotee who has no motive to enjoy fruitive ac-
tivity or mental speculation. Indeed, all respects should be given to him, and
whatever he offers should be accepted. Such devotees are as worshipable as |

TRANSLATION
‘ ‘One may be born in a brahmana family and have all twelve brahminical
qualities, but if he is not devoted to the lotus feet of Lord Krsna, who has a
navel shaped like a lotus, he is not as good as a candala who has dedicated his
mind, words, activities, wealth and life to the service of the Lord. Simply to
take birth in a brahmana family or to have brahminical qualities is not suffi-
cient. One must become a pure devotee of the Lord. If a $va-paca or candila is
a devotee, he delivers not only himself but his whole family, whereas a
brahmana who is not a devotee but simply has brahminical qualifications can-
not even purify himself, not to speak of his family.” ^“
PURPORT
This verse is spoken by Prahlada Maharaja in Srimad-Bhagavatam (7.9.10). A
brahmana is supposed to be qualified with twelve quaiities. As stated in the
Mahabharata:


--- Page 33 ---
30 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 20
dharmas ca satyam ca damas tapas ca
amatsaryam hris titiksanasaya
yajiias ca dana ca dhrtih srutam ca
vratani vai dvadasa brahmanasya
“A brahmana must be perfectly religious. He must be truthful, and he must be able
to control his senses. He must execute severe austerities, and he must be
detached, humble and tolerant. He must not envy anyone, and he must be expert
in performing sacrifices and giving whatever he has in charity. He must be fixed in
devotional service and expert in the knowledge of the Vedas. These are the
twelve qualifications for a brahmana.”
Bhagavad-gita describes the brahminical qualities in this way:
samo damas tapah saucam
ksantir arjavam eva ca
jAanam ৮1/03/7977 astikyam
brahma-karma svabhava-jam
“Peacefulness, self-control, austerity, purity, tolerance, honesty, wisdom, knowl-
edge, and religiousness—these are the qualities by which the brahmanas work.”
(Bg. 18.42)
In the Muktaphala-tika, it is said:
samo damas tapah saucam
ksanty-arjava-viraktayah
jAana-vijAiana-santosah
satyastikye dvisad gunah
“Mental equilibrium, sense control, austerity, cleanliness, tolerance, simplicity,
detachment, theoretical and practical knowledge, satisfaction, truthfulness and
firm faith in the Vedas are the twelve qualities of a brahmana.”

Staying within everyone's heart, Lord Krsna works very gravely. No one can

activity of a person in devotional service, He helps him in such a way that the
devotee cannot understand how things are happening. If the devotee is deter-

mined to serve the Lord, the Lord is always prepared to help him (dadami buddhi-
yoga tam yena mam upayanti te). $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is telling Sanatana
Gosvami how merciful the Lord is. Sanatana Gosvami was a minister in the service
of Nawab Hussain Shah. He was always mixing with people materially inclined,
particularly with Mohammedans, meat-eaters. Although he was in intimate touch
with them, by Krsna's mercy he came to find such association distasteful.
Therefore he left them. As stated by Srinivasa Acarya: tyaktva tarnam asesa-man-
dala-pati-srenim sada tucchavat. Krsna enlightened Sanatana Gosvami in such a
way that he was able to give up his exalted post as minister. Thinking his material
position insignificant, Sanatana was prepared to become a mendicant. Ap-
preciating the activities of Sanatana Gosvami, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu praised
his action and thanked Krsna for His mercy upon him.

TRANSLATION
Candrasekhara then made Sanatana Gosvami look like a gentleman. He took
him to bathe in the Ganges, and afterwards he brought him a new set of
clothes.
PURPORT
The words bhadra karaia are significant in this verse. Due to his long hair,
moustache and beard, Sanatana Gosvami looked like a daravesa, or hippie. Since
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu did not like Sanatana Gosvami's hippie features, he im-
mediately asked Candrasekhara to get him shaved clean. If anyone with long hair
or a beard wants to join this Krsna consciousness movement and live with us, he
must similarly shave himself clean. The followers of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu con-
sider long hair objectionable. Sanatana Gosvami was saved from a hellish condi-
tion (Maharaurava) by the grace of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Maharaurava is a
hell wherein animal killers are placed. In this regard, refer to Srimad-Bhagavatam
(5.26.10-12).

Sanatana did not accept them. When Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu heard news of
this, he became unlimitedly happy.

Text 82] The Lord Instructs Sanatana Gosvami 41
TRANSLATION
Sanatana replied, “| shall practice the process of madhukari. Why should 1
accept full meals in the house of a brahmana?’’
PURPORT
The word madhukari comes from the word madhukara, which refers to bees
collecting honey from flower to flower. A madhukari is a saintly person or a men-
dicant who does not accept a full meal at one house but begs from door to door,
taking a little food from each householder’s place. In this way he does not overeat
or give householders unnecessary trouble. A person in the renounced order may
beg but not cook. His begging should not be a burden for the householders. The
madhukari process is strictly to be followed by a babdji, that is, one who has at-
tained the paramaharitsa stage. This practice is still current in Vrndavana, and
there are many places where alms are offered. Unfortunately, there are many beg-
gars who have come to Vindavana to accept alms but not follow the principles of
Sanatana Gosvami. People try to imitate him and lead an idle life by practicing
madhukari. It is almost impossible to strictly follow Sanatana Gosvami or Rapa
Gosvami. It is better to accept food offered to Krsna in the temple than to try to
imitate Sanatana Gosvami and Rapa Gosvami.

The ideal sannyasi strictly follows the ways practiced by the Gosvamis.

SYNONYMS

nica jati—born of a low family; nica-sarigi—associated with low men; patita—
fallen; adhama—the lowest; ku-visaya-kdpe—in a well of material enjoyment;
padi’—having fallen down; gonainu—I have passed; janama—my life.

TRANSLATION

Sanatana Gosvami said, “| was born in a low family, and my associates are
all low-class men. | myself am fallen and am the lowest of men. Indeed, | have
passed my whole life falien in the well of sinful materialism.

PURPORT

Actually ज Sanatana Gosvami belonged to a brahmana family because he
belonged to the Sarasvata division of the brahmanas and was well cultured and
well educated. Somehow or other he accepted a ministership in the Muslim
government; therefore he had to associate with meat-eaters, drunkards and gross
materialists. Sanatana Gosvami considered himself fallen, for in the association of
such men, he also fell victim to material enjoyment. Having passed his life in that
way, he considered that he had wasted his valuable time. This statement about
how one can become fallen in this material world is made by the greatest
authority in the Gaudiya Vaisnava-sampradaya. Actually the whole world is pres-
ently fallen into material existence. Everyone is a meat-eater, drunkard, woman
hunter, gambler and whatnot. People are enjoying material life by committing the
four basic sins. Although they are fallen, if they simply submit themselves at the
lotus feet of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, they will be saved from sinful reactions.

“Who am 1? Why do the threefold miseries always give me trouble? If | do

The threefold material miseries are miseries arising from the body and the mind,
miseries arising from dealings with other living entities, and miseries arising from
natural disturbances. Sometimes we suffer bodily when we are attacked by a
fever, and sometimes we suffer mentally when a close relative dies. Other living
entities also cause us misery. There are living entities born of the human embryo,

natural catastrophes are controlled by the higher demigods. There may be severe
cold or thunderbolts, or a person may be haunted by ghosts. These threefold mis-
eries are always before us, and they entrap us in a dangerous situation. Padam

“It is the living entity's constitutional position to be an eternal servant of
Krsna because he is the marginal energy of Krsna and a manifestation
simultaneously one and different from the Lord, like a molecular particle of
sunshine or fire. Krsna has three varieties of energy.

PURPORT

Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura paraphrases these verses as follows: 5 Sanatana
Gosvami asked ऽत Caitanya Mahaprabhu, “Who am 12” In answer, the Lord
replied, “You are a pure living entity. You are neither the material body nor the
subtle body composed of mind and intelligence. Actually you are a spirit soul,
eternal part and parcel of the Supreme Soul, Krsna. Therefore you are His eternal
servant. You belong to Krsna’s marginal potency. There are two worlds —the
spiritual world and the material world—and you are situated between the ma-
terial and spiritual potencies. You have a relationship with both the material and
spiritual worlds; therefore you are called the marginal potency. You are related
with Krsna as one and simultaneously different. Because you are spirit soul, you
are one in quality with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but because you are
a very minute particle of spirit soul, you are different from the Supreme Soul.
Therefore your position is simultaneously one with and different from the
Supreme Soul. The examples given are those of the sun itself and the small par-
ticles of sunshine and of a blazing fire and the small particles of fire.” Another ex-
planation of these verses can be found in Adi-lila (Chapter Two, verse 96).

‘‘Forgetting Krsna, the living entity has been attracted by the external
feature from time immemorial. Therefore the illusory energy [mayal gives him
all kinds of misery in his material existence.
PURPORT
When the living entity forgets his constitutional position as an eternal servant
of Krsna, he is immediately entrapped by the illusory, external energy. The living
entity is originally part and parcel of Krsna and is therefore the superior energy of
Krsna. He is endowed with inconceivable minute energy that works inconceivably
within the body. However, the living entity, forgetting his position, is situated in
material energy. The living entity is called the marginal energy because by nature
he is spiritual but by forgetfulness he is situated in the material energy. Thus he
has the power to live either in the material energy or in the spiritual energy, and
for this reason he is called marginal energy. He is sometimes attracted by the ex-
ternal illusory energy when he stays in the marginal position, and this is the
beginning of his material life. When he enters the material energy, he is subjected
to the threefold time measurement —past, present and future. Past, present and
future belong only to the material world; they do not exist in the spiritual world.
The living entity is eternal, and he existed before the creation of this material
world. Unfortunately he has forgotten his relationship with Krsna. The living en-
tity’s forgetfulness is described herein as anadi, which indicates that it has existed
since time immemorial. One should understand that due to his desire to enjoy
himself in competition with Krsna, the living entity comes into material existence.

TRANSLATION
‘‘In the material condition, the living entity is sometimes raised to higher
planetary systems and material prosperity and sometimes drowned in a hellish
situation. His state is exactly like that of a criminal whom a king punishes by
submerging him in water and then raising him again from the water.
PURPORT
In the Vedas it is stated, asango ‘yam purusah: the living entity is always free
from the contamination of the material world. One who is not materially infected
and who does not forget Krsna as his master is called nitya-mukta. In other words,
one who is eternally liberated from material contamination is called nitya-mukta.
From time immemorial the nitya-mukta living entity has always been a devotee of
Krsna, and his only attempt has been to serve Krsna. Thus he never forgets his
eternal servitorship to Krsna. Any living entity who forgets his eternal relationship
with Krsna is under the sway of the material condition. Bereft of the Lord's tran-
scendental loving service, he is subjected to the reactions of fruitive activity.
When he is elevated to the higher planetary systems due to worldly pious ac-
tivities, he considers himself well situated, but when he is subjected to punish-
ment, he thinks himself improperly situated. Thus material nature awards and
punishes the living entity. When the living entity is materially opulent, material
nature is rewarding him. When he is materially embarrassed, material nature is
punishing him.

TRANSLATION

^“ ‘When the living entity is attracted by the material energy, which is separ-
ate from Krsna, he is overpowered by fear. Because he is separated from the
Supreme Personality of Godhead by the material energy, his conception of life
is reversed. In other words, instead of being the eternal servant of Krsna, he
becomes Krsna’s competitor. This is called viparyayo ’smrtih. To nullify this
mistake, one who is actually learned and advanced worships the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead as his spiritual master, worshipful Deity and source of
life. He thus worships the Lord by the process of unalloyed devotional ser-
vice.’

PURPORT

This is a quotation from Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.2.37). It is an instruction given
by Kavi Rsi, one of the nine saintly personalities called the nine Yogendras. When
Vasudeva, Krsna's father, asked Devarsi Narada in Dvaraka about devotional ser-
vice, it was mentioned that previously King Nimi, who was the King of Videha,
was instructed by the nine Yogendras. When ऽप Narada Muni discoursed on
bhagavata-dharma, devotional service, he indicated how a conditioned soul can
be liberated by engaging in the loving transcendental service of the Lord. The Lord
is the Supersoul, spiritual master and worshipable Deity of all conditioned souls.
Not only is Krsna the supreme worshipful Deity for all living entities, but He is also
the guru, or caitya-guru, the Supersoul who always gives the living entity good
counsel. Unfortunately the living entity neglects the Supreme Person's instruc-
tions. He thus identifies with material energy and is consequently overpowered
by a kind of fear resulting from accepting himself as the material body and con-
sidering paraphernalia related to the material body to be his property. All types of
fruitive results actually come from the spirit soul, but because he has forgotten his
real duty, he is embarrassed by many material consequences such as fear and at-

tachment. The only remedy is to revert to the service of the Lord and thus be
saved from material nature's unwanted harassment.

PURPORT
A conditioned soul is one who has forgotten Krsna as his eternal master.
Thinking that he is enjoying the material world, the conditioned soul suffers the
threefold miseries of material existence. Saintly persons (sadhus), Vaisnava devo-
tees of the Lord, preach Krsna consciousness on the basis of Vedic literature. It is
only by their mercy that the conditioned soul is awakened to Krsna conscious-
ness. When awakened, he is no longer eager to enjoy the materialistic way of life.
Instead, he devotes himself to the loving transcendental service of the Lord.
When one engages in the 10105 devotional service, he becomes detached from
material enjoyment.

(Bhag. 11.2.42)
This is the test by which one can tell whether he is advancing in devotional ser-
vice. One must be detached from material enjoyment. Such detachment means


--- Page 66 ---
Text 122] The Lord Instructs Sanatana Gosvami 63
that maya has actually given the conditioned soul liberation from illusory enjoy-
ment. When one is advanced in Krsna consciousness, he does not consider him-
self as good as Krsna. Whenever he thinks that he is the enjoyer of material advan-
tages, he is imprisoned in the bodily conception. However, when he is freed from
the bodily conception, he can engage in devotional service, which is his actual
position of freedom from the clutches of maya. This is all explained in the
following verse from Bhagavad-gita (7.14).

(supplements to the Vedic literature).

TRANSLATION

“The conditioned soul cannot revive his Krsna consciousness by his own
effort. But out of causeless mercy, Lord Krsna compiled the Vedic literature
and its supplements, the Puranas.

PURPORT

A conditioned soul is bewildered by the Lord's illusory energy (maya). Maya's
business is to keep the conditioned soul forgetful of his real relationship with
Krsna. Thus the living entity forgets his real identity as spirit soul, Brahman, and in-
stead of realizing his factual position thinks himself the product of the material en-
ergy. According to Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.7.5):

yaya sammohito jiva
atmanam tri-gunatmakam
paro ‘pi manute ‘nartham
tat-krtam cabhipadyate
“Due to this external energy, the living entity, although transcendental to the
three modes of material nature, thinks of himself as a material product and thus
undergoes the reactions of material miseries.”

This is a description of maya’s action upon the conditioned soul. Thinking him-
self a product of the material energy, the conditioned soul engages in the service
of material energy in so many ways. He becomes the servant of lust, anger, greed
and envy. In this way one totally becomes a servant of the illusory energy. Later,
the bewildered soul becomes a servant of mental speculation, but in any case
he is simply covered by the illusory energy. Out of his causeless mercy and com-
passion, Krsna has compiled various Vedic literatures in His incarnation as
Vyasadeva. Vyasadeva is a saktydvesa-avatara of Lord Krsna. He has very kindly
presented these literatures to awaken the conditioned soul to his senses. Unfor-
tunately, at the present moment the conditioned souls are guided by demons
who do not care to read the Vedic literatures. Although there is an immense
treasure-house of knowledge, people are engaged in reading useless literature
that will give them no information on how to get out of the clutches of maya. The
purpose of the Vedic literatures is explained in the following verses.

TRANSLATION

“The forgetful conditioned soul is educated by Krsna through the Vedic
literatures, the realized spiritual master and the Supersoul. Through these, he
can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead as He is, and he can
understand that Lord Krsna is his eternal master and deliverer from the
clutches of maya. In this way one can acquire real knowledge of his condi-
tioned life and can come to understand how to attain liberation.

PURPORT

Being forgetful of his real position, the conditioned soul may take help from
$astra, guru and the Supersoul within his heart. Krsna is situated within everyone's
heart as the Supersoul. As stated in Bhagavad-gita:

i$varah sarva-bhatanarn
hrd-dese ‘rjuna tisthati
bhramayan sarva-bhatani
yantraradhani mayaya
“The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone's heart, O Arjuna, and is directing the
wanderings of all living entities, who are seated as on a machine, made of the ma-
terial energy.” (Bg. 18.61)

As the saktyavesa-avatara Vyasadeva, Krsna teaches the conditioned soul
through Vedic literatures. Krsna externally appears as the spiritual master and
trains the conditioned soul to come to Krsna consciousness. When his original
Krsna consciousness is revived, the conditioned soul is delivered from the material
clutches. Thus a conditioned soul is always helped by the Supreme Personality of


--- Page 69 ---
66 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 20
Codhead in three ways —by the scriptures, the spiritual master and the Supersoul
within the heart. The Lord is the deliverer of the conditioned soul and is accepted
as the Supreme Lord of all living entities. Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (18.66):
sarva-dharman parityajya
mam ekarn saranarn vraja
aharn tvarn sarva-papebhyo
moksayisyami ma sucah
This same instruction is found throughout all Vedic literature. Sadhu, sastra and
guru act as the representatives of Krsna, and the Krsna consciousness movement
is also taking place all over the universe. Whoever takes advantage of this oppor-
tunity becomes liberated.

SYNONYMS

abhidheya—activities to revive one’s relationship; nama—named; bhakti—
devotional service; prema—Ilove of Godhead; prayojana—the ultimate goal of
life; purusa-artha-siromani—the topmost interest of the living entity; prema—
love of Godhead; maha-dhana—the greatest wealth.

TRANSLATION

“Devotional service, or sense activity for the satisfaction of the Lord, is
called abhidheya because it can develop one’s original love of Godhead,
which is the goal of life. This goal is the living entity’s topmost interest and
greatest wealth. Thus one attains the platform of transcendental loving service
unto the Lord.

PURPORT

The conditioned soul is bewildered by the external material energy, which fully
engages him in a variety of sense gratification. Due to engagement in material ac-
tivities, one’s original Krsna consciousness is covered. However, as the supreme
father of all living entities, Krsna wants His sons to return home, back to Godhead;
therefore He personally comes to deliver Vedic literatures like Bhagavad-gita. He
engages His confidential servants who serve as spiritual masters and enlighten the
conditioned living entities. Being present in everyone's heart, the Lord gives the
living entities the conscience whereby they can accept the Vedas and the spiritual
master. In this way the living entity can understand his constitutional position and
his relationship with the Supreme Lord. As personally enunciated by the Lord Him-
self in Bhagavad-gita (15.15), vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah: through the
study of Vedanta, one may become fully aware of his relationship with the
Supreme Lord and act accordingly. In this way one may ultimately attain the plat-
form of loving service to the Lord. It is in the living entity's best interest to under-
stand the Supreme Lord. Unfortunately, the living entities have forgotten;
therefore Srimad-Bhagavatam says: na te viduh svartha-gatih hi vispum
(Bhag. 7.5.31).

Everyone wants to achieve life's ultimate goal, but due to being absorbed in the
material energy, we waste our time with sense gratification. Through the study of
Vedic literatures—of which the essence is Bhagavad-gita—one comes to Krsna
consciousness. Thus one engages in devotional service, called abhidheya. When
actually developed, love of Godhead is called prayojana, the living entity's ulti-
mate goal. When one becomes fully Krsna conscious, he has attained the perfec-
tion of life.

Sometimes we go to an astrologer or palmist when we are in a distressed condi-

always distressed by the threefold miseries of material existence. Under the

circumstances, he is inquisitive about his position. For instance, Sanatana Gosvami
approached the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, to
ask Him why he was in a distressed condition. This is the position of all condi-
tioned souls. We are always in a distressed condition, and an intelligent man
naturally becomes inquisitive. This position is called brahma-jijiasa. Athato
brahma-jijidsa (Vedanta-satra 1.1.1). Brahma here refers to Vedic literature. One
should consult Vedic literature to know why the conditioned soul is always in a
distressed condition. Vedic literatures are meant to free the conditioned soul from
the miserable conditions of material existence. In this chapter, the story of the
astrologer Sarvajia and the poor man is very instructive.

TRANSLATION

“By the words of the astrologer, the poor man’s connection with the
treasure was established. Similarly, Vedic literature advises us that our real
connection is with Sri Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

PURPORT
In Bhagavad-gita (7.26), Sri Krsna says:
vedaham samatitani
vartamanani carjuna
bhavisyani ca bhatani
marn tu veda na kascana
“O Arjuna, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, | know everything that has
happened in the past, all that is happening in the present, and all things that are
yet to come. | also know all living entities, but Me no one knows.”

Thus Krsna knows the cause of the distressed condition of the conditioned
soul. He therefore descends from His original position to instruct the conditioned
soul and inform him about his forgetfulness of his relationship with Krsna. Krsna
exhibits Himself in His relationships in Vrndavana and at the Battle of Kuruksetra
so that people will be attracted to Him and will again return home, back to God-
head. Krsna also says in Bhagavad-gita that He is the proprietor of all universes, the

enjoyer of everything that be and the friend of everyone. Suhrdarn sarva-
bhatanarn jhatva mam santim rcchati (Bg. 5.29). If we revive our original intimate
relationship with Krsna, our distressed condition in the material world will be
mitigated. Everyone is trying to adjust to the distressed conditions of material ex-
istence, but the basic problems cannot be solved unless one is in an intimate rela-
tionship with Krsna.

PURPORT

The Vedic literatures, including the Puranas, state that according to the position
of the conditioned soul, there are different processes—karma-kanda, jAiana-kan-
da, the yogic process and the bhakti-yoga process. Karma-kanda is compared to
wasps and drones that will simply bite if one takes shelter of them. JAdna-kanda,
the speculative process, is simply like a ghost who creates mental disturbances.
Yoga, the mystic process, is compared to a black snake that devours people by the
impersonal cultivation of kaivalya. However, if one takes to bhakti-yoga, he be-
comes quickly successful. In other words, through bhakti-yoga, one’s hands touch
the hidden treasure without difficulty.

Therefore it is said in Bhagavad-gita: vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah. One
has to take to devotional service. Although the Vedas enjoin one to search out
Krsna and take shelter at His lotus feet, other Vedic processes will not help. Ac-
cording to Bhagavad-gita, only the bhakti process is said to be definitive. Bhaktya
mam abhijanati. This is the conclusive statement of the Vedas, and one has to ac-
cept this process if one is serious in searching for Krsna, the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. In this connection, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura gives the
following statement. The eastern side represents devotional service to Lord Krsna.
The southern side represents the process of fruitive activity (karma-kanda), which
ends in material gain. The western side represents jAdana-kanda, the process of
mental speculation, sometimes called siddhi-kanda. The northern side represents
the speculative method sometimes known as the mystic yoga system. It is only
the eastern side, devotional service, that enables one to attain life's real goal. On
the southern side, there are fruitive activities by which one is subject to the
punishment of Yamaraja. When one follows the system of fruitive activity, his ma-
terial desires remain prominent. Consequently the results of this process are com-
pared to wasps and drones. The living entity is bitten by the wasps and drones of
fruitive activity and thus suffers in material existence birth after birth. One cannot
be free from material desires by following this process. The propensity for material
enjoyment never ends. Therefore the cycle of birth and death continues, and the
spirit soul suffers perpetually.

The mystic yoga process is compared to a black snake that devours the living
entity and injects him with poison. The ultimate goal of the yoga system is to be-


--- Page 77 ---
74 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 20
come one with the Absolute. This means finishing one’s personal existence.
However, the spiritual part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead has
an eternal individual existence. Bhagavad-gita confirms that the individual soul ex-
15090 in the past, is existing in the present and will continue to exist as an in-
dividual in the future. Artificially trying to become one with the Absolute is suici-
dal. One cannot annihilate his natural condition.

A yaksa, a protector of riches, will not allow anyone to take away riches for en-
joyment. Such a demon will simply create disturbances. In other words, a devotee
will not depend on his material resources but on the mercy of the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead, who can give real protection. This is called raksisyatiti
visvasah or (in the Bengali poetry of Bhaktivinoda Thakura's Saranagati), ‘avasya
raksibe krsna’——visvasa palana. The surrendered soul must accept the fact that
his real protector is Krsna, not his material acquisitions.

Considering all these points, devotional service to Krsna is the real treasure-
house for the living entity. When one comes to the platform of devotional ser-
vice, he always remains opulent in the association of the Supreme Personality of
Codhead. One who is bereft of devotional service is swallowed by the black
snake of the yoga system and bitten by the wasps and drones of fruitive activity,
and he suffers consequent material miseries. Sometimes the living entity is misled
into trying to merge into spiritual existence, thinking himself as good as the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. This means that when he comes to the spiritual
platform, he will be disturbed and will again return to the material platform. Ac-
cording to Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.2.32):

ye ‘nye ‘ravindaksa vimukta-maninas
tvayy asta-bhavad avisuddha-buddhayah
aruhya krcchrena param padam tatah
patanty adho ‘nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah
Such people may become sannyasis, but unless they take shelter of Krsna's lotus
feet, they will return to the material platform to perform philanthropic activities. In
this way, one’s spiritual life is lost. This is to be understood as being devoured by
the black snake.

As stated in Bhagavad-gita (18.55):

“One can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional service.
And when one is in full consciousness of the Supreme Lord by such devotion, he
can enter the kingdom of God.”

The aim of life is to get rid of the material conditioning and enter into spiritual
existence. Although the sastras prescribe different methods for different men, the
Supreme Personality of Godhead says that one ultimately must accept the path of
devotional service as the assured path of spiritual advancement. Devotional ser-
vice to the Lord is the only process actually confirmed by the Lord. Sarva-dharman
parityajya mam ekarir 52/2/12/7 vraja (Bg. 18.66). One must become a devotee if
one wants to return home, back to Godhead, and become eternally blissful.

by different speculations, either by indirect understanding or by dictionary
understanding. Everyone is speculating about Me. The essence of all Vedic
literatures is to distinguish Me from maya. By considering the illusory energy,
one comes to the platform of understanding Me. In this way one becomes free
from speculation about the Vedas and comes to Me as the conclusion. Thus
one is satisfied.’

PURPORT

These two verses are quoted from Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.21.42, 43). When
Uddhava asked Krsna about the purpose of Vedic speculation, the Lord informed
him of the process of understanding Vedic literature. The Vedas are composed of
karma-kanda, jiana-kanda and updsana-kanda. If one analytically studies the pur-

PURPORT
This is a quotation from Bhavartha-dipika, Sridhara Svami’s commentary on the
Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.1.1). In the Tenth Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam there is a
description of the asraya-tattva, Sri Krsna. There are two tattvas —asraya-tattva and
asrita-tattva. Asraya-tattva is the objective, and asrita-tattvais the subjective. Since
the lotus feet of Lord जा Krsna are the shelter of all devotees, Sri Krsna is called
(2212171 dhama. in Bhagavad-gita it is stated: param brahma param dhama pavitrarm
paramarin bhavan. Everything is resting under the lotus feet of Krsna. In Srimad-
Bhagavatam (10.14.58) it is stated:
samasrita ye pada-pallava-plavarin
mabhat-padarn punya-yaso-murareh
Under the lotus feet of Sr Krsna, the entire mahat-tattva is existing. Since every-
thing is under Sri Krsna's protection, SrT Krsna is called asraya-tattva. Everything
else is called asrita-tattva. The material creation is also called asrita-tattva. Libera-
tion from material bondage and the attainment of the spiritual platform are also
asrita-tattva. Krsna is the only asraya-tattva. In the beginning of the creation there
are Maha-Visnu, Garbhodakasayi Visnu and KsirodakasayT Visnu. They are also
asraya-tattva. Krsna is the cause of all causes (sarva-karana-karanam). To under-
stand Krsna perfectly, one has to make an analytical study of asraya-tattva and
asrita-tattva.

_ This is a quotation from Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.14.55). Pariksit Maharaja asked
Sukadeva Gosvami why Krsna was so beloved by the residents of Vrndavana,


--- Page 94 ---
Text 163] The Lord Instructs Sanatana Gosvami 91
who loved Him even more than their own offspring or life itself. At that time
Sukadeva Cosvami replied that everyone's atma, or soul, is very, very dear, es-
pecially to all living entities who have accepted material bodies. However, that
atma, the spirit soul, is part and parcel of Krsna. For this reason, Krsna is very dear
to every living entity. Everyone's body is very dear to oneself, and one wants to
protect the body by all means because within the body the soul is living. Due to
the intimate relationship between the soul and the body, the body is important
and dear to everyone. Similarly, the soul, being part and parcel of Krsna, the
Supreme Lord, is very, very dear to all living entities. Unfortunately, the soul
forgets his constitutional position and thinks he is only the body (deha-atma-bud-
dhi). Thus the soul is subjected to the rules and regulations of material nature.
When a living entity, by his intelligence, reawakens his attraction for Krsna, he can
understand that he is not the body but part and parcel of Krsne. Thus filled with
knowledge, he no longer labors under attachment to the body and everything re-
lated to the body. Janasya moho ‘yam aham mameti. Material existence, wherein
one thinks, “I am the body, and this belongs to me,” is also illusory. One must
redirect his attraction to Krsna. Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.7) states:
vasudeve bhagavati
bhakti-yogah prayojitah
janayaty asu vairagyam
jAanam ca yad ahaitukam
“By rendering devotional service unto the Personality of Godhead, $i Krsna, one
immediately acquires causeless knowledge and detachment from the world.”

TRANSLATION
“The Supreme Personality of Godhead exists in three principal forms—
svayari-riipa, tad-ekatma-riapa, and avesa-rapa.
PURPORT
Srila Rapa Gosvami has described svayam-rapa in his Laghu-bhagavatamrta,
Parva-khanda, verse 12, ananyapeksi yad rapam svayarih-rapah sa ucyate: the
original form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead does not depend on other
forms. The original form is called svayarn-rapa, and it is described in Srimad-
Bhagavatam: krsnas tu bhagavan svayam (1.3.28). Krsna's original form as a
cowherd boy in Vindavana is called svayam-rapa. It is confirmed in Brahma-
sarmhita (5.1):
i$varah paramah krsnah
sac-cid-ananda-vigrahah
anadir adir govindah
sarva-karana-karapnam
There is nothing superior to Govinda. He is the ultimate source and the cause of
all causes. In Bhagavad-gita (7.7) the Lord says, mattah paratararih nanyat: “There is
no truth superior to Me.”
The tad-ekatma-rapa is also described in the Laghu-bhagavatamrta, Parva-
khanda, verse 14:
yad rapam tad-abhedena
svarapena virajate
akrtyadibhir anyadrk
sa tad-ekatma-rapakah
The tad-ekatma-rapa forms exist simultaneously with the svayarn-rapa form and
are nondifferent. At the same time, the bodily features and specific activities ap-
pear to be different. This tad-ekatma-rapa is also divided into two categories —
svarnsa and vilasa.
His avesa form is also explained in the Laghu-bhagavatamrta, verse 18:
jAana-saktyadi-kalaya
yatravisto janardanah
ta avesa nigadyante
jiva eva mahattamah
A living entity who is specifically empowered by the Lord with knowledge or
strength is technically called avesa-rapa. As stated in the Caitanya-caritamrta (An-

TRANSLATION

^“ “In different Vedic scriptures, there are prescribed rules and regulative
principles for worshiping different types of forms. When one is purified by
these rules and regulations, he worships You, the Supreme Personality of God-
head. Although manifest in many forms, You are one.’

PURPORT

This verse is quoted from Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.40.7). In the Vedas it is stated
that the one becomes many (eko bahu syam). The Supreme Personality of God-
head expands Himself in various forms — visnu-tattva, jiva-tattva and sakti-tattva.


--- Page 101 ---
98 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 20
According to the Vedic literatures, there are different regulative principles for the
worship of each of these forms. If one takes advantage of the Vedic literatures and
purifies himself by following the rules and regulations, ultimately he worships the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna. Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (4.11): mama
vartmanuvartante manusyah partha sarvasah. Worship of the demigods is in a
sense worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but such worship is said to
be avidhi-parvakam, improper. Actually demigod worship is meant for unin-
telligent men. One who is intelligent considers the words of the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead: sarva dharman parityajya mam ekam saranari vraja. One
who worships demigods worships the Supreme Lord indirectly, but according to
the revealed scriptures, there is no need to worship Him indirectly. One can wor-
ship Him directly.

SYNONYMS
vaibhava-prakasa—manifestation of the vaibhava feature; krsnera—of Lord
Krsna; $ri-balarama—Sri Balarama; varpa-matra—color only; bheda—difference;

TRANSLATION
“The first manifestation of the vaibhava feature of Krsna is Sri Balaramaiji.
Sri Balarama and Krsna have different bodily colors, but otherwise Sri
Balarama is equal to Krsna in all respects.
PURPORT
To understand the difference between svayam-rapa, tad-ekatma-rapa, avesa,

prabhava and vaibhava, Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura has given the following de-
scription. In the beginning, Krsna has three bodily features: (1) svayam-rapa, as a
cowherd boy in Vrndavana; (2) tad-ekatma-rapa, which is divided into svarsaka
and vilasa; and (3) avesa-rapa. The svamsaka, or expansions of the personal
potency, are (1) Karanodakasayi, Garbhodakasayi, Ksirodakasayi and
(2) incarnations such as the fish, tortoise, boar and Nrsirmha. The vildsa-rapa has a
prabhava division, including Vasudeva, Sankarsana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha.
There is also a vaibhava division in which there are twenty-four forms, including


--- Page 102 ---
Text 176] The Lord Instructs Sanatana Gosvami 99
the second Vasudeva, Sankarsana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha. For each of these,
there are three forms; therefore there are twelve forms altogether. These twelve
forms constitute the predominant names for the twelve months of the year as
well as the twelve tilaka marks on the body. Each of the four Personalities of God-
head expands into two other forms; thus there are eight forms, such as Purusot-
tama, Acyuta, etc. The four forms (Vasudeva, etc.), the twelve (Kesava, etc.), and
the eight (Purusottama, etc.) all together constitute twenty-four forms. All the
forms are differently named in accordance with the weapons They hold in Their
four hands.

PURPORT
When Lord Krsna took His birth, He appeared outside the womb as four-
handed Visnu. Then Devaki and Vasudeva offered their prayers to Him and asked
Him to assume His two-handed form. The Lord immediately assumed His two-
handed form and ordered that He be transferred to Gokula on the other side of
the River Yamuna.

SYNONYMS

vispnu-kancite—at Visnu-kancl; visnu—Lord Visnu; hari—Lord Hari; rahe —
remains; mayapure—at Mayapur; aiche—similarly; 4ra—also; nana—various;
marti—forms; brahmanda-bhitare—throughout the universe.

TRANSLATION

‘At Visnu-kanci there is Lord Visnu, at Mayapur Lord Hari, and throughout

the universe a variety of other forms.
PURPORT

All of these forms are marti forms, and They are worshiped in the temples. Their
names are Ke$ava at Mathura, Purusottama or Jagannatha at Nilacala, Sri Bindu
Madhava at Prayaga, Madhusadana at Mandara, and Vasudeva, Padmanabha and
Janardana at Anandaranya, which is situated in Kerala, South India. At Visnu-kanci,
which is situated in the Barada state, there is Lord Visnu, and Hari is situated at
Mayapur, Lord Caitanya'’s birthsite. Thus in different places throughout the uni-
verse there are various Deities in temples bestowing Their causeless mercy upon
the devotees. All these Deity forms are nondifferent from the martis in the
spiritual world of the Vaikunthas. Although the arca-marti, the worshipable Deity
form of the Lord, appears to be made of material elements, it is as good as the
spiritual forms found in the spiritual Vaikunthalokas. The Deity in the temple,
however, is visible to the material eyes of the devotee. It is not possible for one in
material conditional life to see the spiritual form of the Lord. To bestow causeless
mercy upon us, the Lord appears as arca-marti so that we can see Him. It is forbid-
den to consider the arca-marti to be made of stone or wood. In the Padma Purana
it is said:

arcye vispau sila-dhir gurusu nara-matir vaispave jati-buddhir
vispor va vaispavanam kali-mala-mathane pada-tirthe ‘mbu-buddhih
$ri-visnor namni mantre sakala-kalusa-he sabde-samanya-buddhir
vispau sarvesvarese tad-itara-sama-dhir yasya va naraki sah

No one should consider the Deity in the temple to be made of stone or wood, nor
should one consider the spiritual master an ordinary human being. No one should
consider a Vaisnava to belong to a particular caste or creed, and no one should
consider carapnamrta or Ganges water to be like ordinary water. Nor should any-
one consider the Hare Krsna maha-mantra to be a material vibration. All these ex-
pansions of Krsna in the material world are simply demonstrations of the Lord's

mercy and willingness to give facility to His devotees who are engaged in His
devotional service within the material world.

PURPORT
In the material world the Lord is situated in different arca-martis (Deities) in the
temples, just to decrease the material activities of the conditioned soul and in-
crease his spiritual activities. Particularly in India there are many temples
throughout the country. Devotees may take advantage of them and go see the
Lord at Jagannatha Puri, Vrndavana, Prayaga, Mathura, Hardwar and Visnu-kanct.
When the devotees travel to these places and see the Lord, they become very
happy in devotional service.

134 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 20
PURPORT

The purusa-avataras are the Lords of .the universal creation. These are the
Karanodakasayi Visnu, Garbhodakasayi Visnu and Ksirodakasayi Visnu. There are
also lila-avataras, and these include (1) Catuhsana, (2) Narada, (3) Varaha,
(4) Matsya, (5) Yajiia, (6) Nara-Narayana, (7) Kardami Kapila, (8) Dattatreya,
(9) Hayasirsa, (10) Harhsa, (11) Dhruvapriya, or Prénigarbha, (12) Rsabha,
(13) Prthu, (14) Nrsirmha, (15) Karma, (16) Dhanvantari, (17) Mohini,

(22) Pralambari Balarama, (23) Krsna, (24) Buddha and (25) Kalki.

These twenty-five Personalities of Godhead are known as lila-avataras. Because
they appear in each day of Brahma, or in each kalpa (millennium), they are some-
times known as kalpa-avataras. Of these incarnations, Harhsa and Mohini are not
very permanent or well known, but They are listed among the prabhava-avataras.
Kapila, Dattatreya, Rsabha, Dhanvantari and Vyasa are eternally situated and very
widely known. They are also counted among the prabhava incarnations. Karma,
Matsya, Narayana, Varaha, Hayagriva, Prénigarbha, and Baladeva, the killer of
Pralambasura, are counted among the vaibhava-avataras.

incarnations of the Manus [manvantara-avataras], incarnations in different
millenniums [yuga-avataras] and incarnations of empowered living entities
[$aktyaves$a-avatarasl.

PURPORT

The guna-avataras are three—Lord Brahma, Lord Siva and Lord Visnu
(Bhag. 10.88.3). The avataras of Manu, or manvantara-avataras, are listed as
follows in S$rimad-Bhagavatam (8.1.5,13); (1) 274, (2) Vibhu, (3) Satyesena,
(4) Hari, (5) Vaikuntha, (6) Ajita, (7) Vamana, (8) Sarvabhauma, (9) Rsabha,
(10) Visvaksena, (11) Dharmasetu, (12) Sudhama, (13) Yogesvara and
(14) Brhadbhanu. Altogether these are fourteen in number, and of these, both
Yaja and Vamana are also counted among the [ila-avataras. All these Manu incar-
nations are sometimes called vaibhava-avataras.

The four yuga-avataras are (1) sukla (white) in the Satya-yuga (Bhag. 11.5.21),
(2) rakta (red) in the Treta-yuga (Bhag. 11.5.24), (3) syama (dark blue) in the
Dvapara-yuga (Bhag. 11.5.27), and (4) generally krsna (black) but in special cases
pita (yellow) as Caitanya Mahaprabhu in the Kali-yuga, (Bhag. 11.5.32 and
10.8.13).

The saktyavesa-avatara is categorized into (1) forms of divine absorption
(bhagavad-avesa) like Kapiladeva or Rsabhadeva and (2) divinely empowered
forms (Saktyavesa), of whom there are seven: (1) Sesa Naga in the Vaikuntha
world, empowered for the personal service of the Supreme Lord (sva-sevana-sak-
ti), (2) Anantadeva, empowered to bear all the planets within the universe (bha-
dharana-sakti, (3) Lord Brahma, empowered with the energy to create the cos-
mic manifestation (srsti-sakti), (4) Catuhsana, or the Kumaras, specifically em-
powered to distribute transcendental knowledge (jAana-sakti), (5) Narada Muni,
empowered to distribute devotional service (bhakti-sakt), (6) Maharaja Prthu,
specifically empowered to rule and maintain the living entities (palana-sakti) and
(7) Parasurama, specifically empowered to cut down rogues and demons (dusta-
damana-sakti).

Krsna are within this material world, but they are visible by the causeless mercy of

the Lord. We should not consider them to belong to this material world. As stated
in Bhagavad-gita:

“Fools deride Me when | descend in the human form. They do not know My tran-

Avataras descend of their own free will, and although they may act like ordinary
human beings, they do not belong to this material world. Lord Krsna and His
avataras can be understood only by the grace of the Lord.

PURPORT
In Bhagavad-gita (7.10), Krsna says, bijarn marn sarva-bhatanam: “I am the
original seed of all existences.” This is also confirmed in another verse in
Bhagavad-gita (14.4):
sarva-yonisu kaunteya
martayah sambhavanti yah
tasar brahma mahad-yonir
aha bija-pradah pita
“It should be understood that all species of life, O son of Kunti, are made possible
by birth in this material nature, and that | am the seed-giving father.”
For a further explanation, one may refer to Brahma-sarmmhita (Chapter Five,
verses 10-13). Brahma-samhita also states (5.51):
agnir mahi gaganam ambu marud disas ca
kalas tathatma-manasiti jagat-trayani
yasmad bhavanti vibhavanti visanti yarn ca
govindam adi-purusarin tam aham bhajami
All material elements, as well as the spiritual sparks (individual souls), are
emanating from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is also confirmed by
the Vedanta-satra (1.1). Janmady asya yatah: “The Absolute Truth is He from


--- Page 154 ---
Text 273] The Lord Instructs Sanatana Gosvami 151
whom everything emanates.” He is the Supreme Truth: satya parari dhimahi
(Bhag. 1.1.1). The absolute ultimate truth is Krsna. Om namo bhagavate
vasudevaya/ janmady asya yato ‘nvayad itaratas carthesv abhijhah sva-rat: “The
Absolute Truth is a person who is directly and indirectly cognizant of the entire
cosmic manifestation.” (Bhag. 1.1.1)

The Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, educated Lord
Brahma from the heart (Bhag. 1.1.1): tene brahma hrda ya adi-kavaye. Therefore
the Absolute Truth cannot be dull matter; the Absolute Truth must be the
Supreme Person Himself. Sei purusa maya-pane kare avadhana. Simply by His
glance, material nature is impregnated with all living entities. According to their
karma and fruitive activity, they emerge in different bodies. That is the explana-
tion given by Bhagavad-gita (2.13):

dehino ‘smin yatha dehe
kaumaram yauvanarn jara
tatha dehantara-praptir
dhiras tatra na muyhyati
“As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to
old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. The self-realized soul
is not bewildered by such a change.”

sva-anga-visesa-abhasa-rape —in the form of a specific shadow from His per-
sonal body; prakrti-sparsana—the Lord glances over the material nature; jiva-

bija—semina; tate —in that material nature; kaila samarpana—impregnated.

TRANSLATION

‘To impregnate with the seeds of living entities, the Lord Himself does not
directly touch the material energy, but by His specific functional expansion,
He touches the material energy, and thus the living entities, who are His parts
and parcels, are impregnated into material nature.


--- Page 155 ---
152 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 20
PURPORT
According to Bhagavad-gita:
mamaivamso jiva-loke
jiva-bhatah sanatanah
manah sasthanindriyani
prakrti-sthani karsati
“The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental parts. Due
to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which in-
clude the mind.” (Bg. 15.7)

The word prakrti-sparsana is explained in Caitanya-caritamrta in reference to
the way the living entities come in contact with dull matter. The glancing is per-
formed by Maha-Visnu: sa aiksata lokan nu srja iti (Aitareya Upanisad 1.1.1). In
the conditional stage we impregnate according to the bodily conception —that is,
by sexual intercourse —but the Supreme Lord does not need sexual intercourse to
impregnate. The impregnation is performed simply by His glance. This is also ex-
plained in Brahma-sarhhita (5.32):

angani yasya sakalendriya-vrttimanti
pasyanti panti kalayanti cirari jaganti
ananda-cinmaya-sad-ujjvala-vigrahasya
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
Govinda can impregnate simply by glancing. In other words, His eyes can work as
His genitals. He does not need genitals to beget a child. Indeed, Krsna can beget
any one of the living entities with any part of His body.

The word svanga-visesabhasa-rape, the form by which the Lord begets living
entities in the material world, is explained herein. He is Lord Siva. In Brahma-
sarhhita it is stated that Lord Siva, who is another form of Maha-Visnu, is like
yogurt. Yogurt is nothing but milk, yet it is not milk. Similarly, Lord Siva is con-
sidered the father of this universe, and material nature is considered the mother.
The father and mother are known as Lord Siva and the goddess Durga. Together,
Lord Siva's genitals and the vagina of goddess Durga are worshiped as siva-linga.
This is the origin of the material creation. Thus Lord Siva’s position is between the
living entity and the Supreme Lord. Lord Siva is neither the Supreme Personality of
Godhead nor the living entity. He is the form through which the Supreme Lord
works to beget living entities within this material world. As yogurt is prepared
when milk is mixed with a culture, the form of Lord Siva expands when the
Supreme Personality of Godhead is in touch with material nature. The impregna-
tion of material nature by the father, Lord Siva, is wonderful because at one time

“1f we divide the tip of a hair into a hundred parts and then take one of these parts
and divide it again into a hundred parts, that very fine division is the size of but
one of the numberless living entities. They are all cit-kana, particles of spirit, not
matter.”

The innumerable brahmandas, or universes, come from the pores of the Lord's
body, and innumerable living entities also come from the pores of the transcen-
dental body of the Lord. This is the process of material creation. Without the living
entity, this material nature has no value. Both emanate from the pores of the tran-
scendental body of Lord Maha-Visnu. They are different energies. That is ex-
plained in Bhagavad-gita:

bhamir apo 1731০ vayuh
kha mano buddhir eva ca
ahankara 1{7/2/7 me
bhinna prakrtir astadha
“Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego—all together these
eight comprise My separated material energies.” (Bg. 7.4) The material elements
also come from the body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and they are
also a different type of energy. Although the living entities also come from the
Lord's body, they are categorized as a superior energy.

“Besides this inferior nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is a superior energy of
Mine, which consists of all living entities who are struggling with material nature
and are sustaining the universe.” (Bg. 7.5) The inferior energy, matter, cannot act
without the superior energy. All these things are very clearly explained in the
Vedas. The materialistic theory that life develops from matter is incorrect. Life and

matter come from the supreme living entity; therefore, being the source of both,
that supreme living entity, Krsna, is described in Vedanta-satra as janmady asya
yatah (1.1), or the original source of everything, sarva-karana-karanam. This is
further explained in the following verse.

SYNONYMS

daivat—from time immemorial; ksubhita-dharminyam—the material nature,
which is subjected to agitation; svasyam—which belongs to the Supreme as one
of His energies; yonau—in the womb from which the living entity takes his birth;
parah puman—the Supreme Brahman, the Personality of Godhead; adhatta—im-
pregnated; viryam—semina; sa—that material nature; asdta—produced; mahat-
tattvam —the total material energy; hiranmayam—the original source for the
emanation of varieties of material things.

TRANSLATION

^“ ‘From time immemorial, after agitating the material nature into three
qualities, the Supreme Personality of Godhead places the semina of innumer-
able living entities within the womb of that material nature. Thus material
nature gives birth to the total material energy known as the hiranmaya-mahat-
tattva, the original symbolic representation of the cosmic manifestation.’

PURPORT

This is a quotation from S$rimad-Bhagavatam (3.26.19). Lord Kapila is explaining
to His mother the relationship between the Supreme Personality of Godhead and
material nature. He is informing her how the Supreme Personality of Godhead is
the original cause of the living entities, who emanated from material nature. Over
and above the twenty-eight elements of the material creation is the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead, the cause of all causes. Life comes not from matter but from

life itself. As explained in the Vedas: nityo nityanarh cetanas cetananam (Katha
Upanisad 2.2.13). The Supreme Lord is the original source of life.

purusena—by the enjoyer of material nature; atma-bhatena—who is an expan-
sion of His personal self; viryam —semina; adhatta—placed; viryavan—the omni-

TRANSLATION

^“ ‘In due course of time, the Supreme Personality of Godhead [Maha-Visnu
or Maha-Vaikunthanathal, by the agency of a further expansion of His per-
sonal self, places the seed of the living entities within the womb of material
nature.’

PURPORT

This is a quotation from Srimad-Bhagavatam (3.5.26). This verse tells how the
living entities come in contact with material nature. Just as a woman cannot beget
children without uniting with a man, material nature cannot beget living entities
without being in union with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There is a
history of how the Absolute Lord becomes the father of all living entities. In every
system of religion, it is accepted that God is the supreme father of all living en-
tities. According to Christianity, the supreme father, God, provides the living en-
tities with all of life's necessities. Therefore they pray, “Give us this day our daily
bread.” Any religion that does not accept the Supreme Lord as the absolute father
is called kaitava-dharma, or a cheating religion. Such religious systems are rejected
in Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.1.2): dharmah projjhita-kaitavo ‘tra. Only an atheist does


--- Page 159 ---
156 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 20
not accept the omnipotent supreme father. If one accepts the omnipotent
supreme father, he abides by His orders and becomes a religious person.

tabe mabhat-tattva haite trividha aharkara
yaha haite devatendriya-bhatera pracara
SYNONYMS
tabe —thereafter; mabhat-tattva haite—from the total material energy; tri-
vidha—three kinds of; aharikara—egotism; yaha haite —from which; devata—of
predominating deities; indriya—of the senses; bhiatera—and of material ele-
ments; pracara—expansion.
TRANSLATION
‘First the total material energy is manifest, and from this arise the three
types of egotism, which are the original sources from which all demigods
[controlling deities], senses and material elements expand.
PURPORT
The three types of egotism (aharikara) are technically known as vaikarika, taijasa
and tamasa. The mahat-tattva is situated within the heart, or citta, and the pre-
dominating Deity of the mabhat-tattva is Lord Vasudeva (Bhag. 3.26.21). The
mahat-tattva is transformed into three divisions: (1) vaikarika, egotism in good-
ness (sattvika-aharikara), from which the eleventh sense organ, the mind, is
manifest and whose predominating Deity is Aniruddha (8038. 3.26.27-28);
(2) taijasa, or egotism in passion (rajasa-aharkara), from which the senses and in-
telligence are manifest and whose predominating Deity is Lord Pradyumna
(Bhag. 3.26.29-31); (3) tamasa, or egotism in ignorance, from which sound vibra-
tion (sabda-tanmatra) expands. From the sound vibration, the sky (akasa) is
manifest and, the senses, beginning with the ear, are also manifest
(Bhag. 3.26.32). Of these three types of egotism, Lord Sankarsana is the pre-
dominating Deity. In the philosophical discourse known as the Sankhya-karika, it
is stated: sattvika ekadasakah pravartate vaikrtad ahankarat——bhatades tan-
matram tamasa-taijasady-ubhayam.

TRANSLATION
“In this way, the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His form of Visnu
maintains the entire material world. Since He is always beyond the material
qualities, the material nature cannot touch Him.
PURPORT
The influence of the material energy cannot touch Lord Visnu as she touches
Lord Brahma and Lord Siva. Therefore it is said that Lord Visnu is transcendental to
the material qualities. The incarnations of the material qualities —Lord Siva and
Lord Brahma—are under the jurisdiction of the external energy. Lord Visnu,
however, is different. In the mantras of the Rg Veda it is said: om tad visnoh
paramarin padam (Rg Veda-sarmhita 1.22.20). The words paramari padam indicate
that He is transcendental to the material qualities. Because Lord Visnu is not with-
in the jurisdiction of the material qualities, He is always superior to the living en-
tities who are controlled by material energy. This is one of the differences be-
tween the Supreme Lord and the living entities. Lord Brahma is a very powerful
living entity, and Lord Siva is even more powerful. Therefore Lord Siva is not ac-
cepted as a living entity, but at the same time is not considered to be on the level
of Lord Visnu.

Lord Visnu, Brahma and Siva. These are incarnations of the material qualities.
Among the many superior living entities qualified with pious activities and devo-
tional service, one, called Lord Brahma, is infused with the quality of passion by
the supreme will of Garbhodakasayi Visnu. Thus Lord Brahma becomes the incar-
nation of the creative energy of the Lord.

PURPORT
This is a description of the Rudra form, which is another expansion of Krsna.
Only visnu-murtis are expansions of Krsna's personal and plenary portions. Maha-
Visnu, who lies on the Causal Ocean, is an expansion of Sarnkarsana. When
GarbhodakasayT Visnu accepts the material modes of nature for the purpose of
dissolving the cosmic manifestation, His form is called Rudra. As already ex-
plained, Lord Visnu is the controller of maya. How, then, can He associate with
maya? The conclusion is that the incarnation of Lord Siva or Lord Brahma indicates
the absence of the supreme power of Visnu. When the supreme power is not
there, it is possible to associate with may, the external energy. Lord Brahma and
Lord Siva are to be considered creations of maya.

PURPORT
Of the three deities supervising the creation, maintenance and dissolution of
the universe, Lord Visnu is never separate from the original Visnu. However, Lord
Siva and Brahma, due to their association with maya, are different from Visnu.


--- Page 177 ---
174 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 20
Visiu cannot be transformed into any form of material energy. Whenever there is
association with maya, the personality involved must be different from Lord
Visnu. Therefore Lord Siva and Lord Brahma are called gupa-avataras, for they
associate with the material qualities. The conclusion is that Rudra is a transforma-
tion of Visnu, but he is not exactly Lord Visnu. Therefore, he does not come with-
in the category of the visnu-tattvas. Thus he is inconceivably one with Visnu and
different from Him. The example given in this verse is very clear. Milk is compared
to Visnu. As soon as milk touches a sour substance, it becomes yogurt, or Lord
Siva. Although yogurt is constitutionally milk it cannot be used in place of milk.

Visnu is beyond the range of the material manifestation, and He is not within
the control of the material energy. He is the supreme independent Personality of
Godhead. This is even admitted by Sankaracarya: narayanah paro ‘vyaktat (Gita-
bhasya). In his constitutional form, Siva is a maha-bhagavata, a supreme devotee
of the Lord, but because he accepts maya’s association — especially the quality of
ignorance —he is not free from maya’s influence. Such an intimate association is
completely absent in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu. Lord Siva ac-
cepts maya, but in the presence of Lord Visnu, maya does not exist. Consequently
Lord Siva has to be considered a product of maya. When Lord Siva is free from
maya’sinfluence, he is in the position of a maha-bhagavata, a supreme devotee of
Lord Visnu. Vaisnpavanari yatha sSambhuh.

and try to meditate upon it. It has become fashionable to meditate, but people
know nothing about the object of meditation. That is explained here. Yad
dhyayato vispum. One has to meditate upon Lord Visnu or Lord Krsna. Without
referring to the sastras, so-called meditators aim at impersonal objects. Lord Krsna
has condemned them in Bhagavad-gita (12.5):
kleso ‘dhikataras tesam
avyaktasakta-cetasam
avyakta hi gatir duhkharin
dehavadbhir avapyate
“For those whose minds are attached to the unmanifested, impersonal feature of
the Supreme, advancement is very troublesome. To make progress in that dis-
cipline is always difficult for those who are embodied.”

Not knowing how to meditate, foolish people simply suffer, and there is no
benefit derived from their spiritual activities. The same reference can be found in
the following verse from the Vispu Purana (6.2.17), Padma Purapa (Uttara-
khanda 72.25) and Brhan-naradiya Purana (38.97).

Sanatana Gosvami said, “| am a very insignificant living entity. | am low and

This verse is very important in reference to the incarnations of God. At present
there are especially many rascals prevalent in India who proclaim themselves in-
carnations of God or goddesses. Thus they are fooling and bluffing foolish people.
On behalf of the general populace, Sanatana Gosvami presented himself as a
foolish, lowborn, poorly behaved person, although he was a most exalted per-
sonality. Inferior people cannot accept the real God, yet they are very eager to ac-
cept an imitation God who can simply bluff foolish people. All this is going on in
this age of Kali. To guide these foolish people, ज Caitanya Mahaprabhu answers
the question as follows.

SYNONYMS

prabhu kahe —Lord $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu said; anya-avatira—the incarna-
tions in other yugas; sastra-dvare jani—one has to accept by reference to the
$astras; kalite—in this age of Kali; avatara—incarnation; taiche —similarly; sastra-
vakye mani—one has to accept according to the description of revealed scrip-
tures.

TRANSLATION

Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu replied, ८45 in other ages an incarnation is ac-
cepted according to the directions of the 5351725, in this age of Kali an incarna-
tion of God should be accepted in that way.

PURPORT

According to Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, this is the way an incarnation should be
accepted. Srila Narottama dasa Thakura says, sadhu-$astra-guru-vakya, cittete
kariya aikya. One should accept a thing as genuine by studying the words of
saintly people, the spiritual master and sastra. The actual center is $astra, the
revealed scripture. If a spiritual master does not speak according to revealed scrip-
ture, he is not to be accepted. Similarly, if a saintly person does not speak ac-
cording to the $astra, he is not a saintly person. Sastra is the center for all. Unfor-
tunately, at the present moment, people do not refer to the sastras; therefore
they accept rascals as incarnations, and consequently they have made incarna-
tions into a very cheap thing. Intelligent people who follow S$ri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu’s instructions and the instructions of the dcarya, the bona fide
spiritual master, will not accept a pretender as an incarnation of God. In Kali-yuga,
the only incarnation is $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Imitation incarnations take ad-
vantage of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. The Lord appeared within the past five
hundred years, played as the son of a brahmana from Nadia and introduced the
sarikirtana movement. Imitating $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and ignoring the sastra,
rascals present themselves as incarnations and introduce their rascaldom as a
religious process. As we have repeatedly said, religion can be given only by the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. From the discussions in Caitanya-caritamrta, we
can understand that in different ages the Supreme Lord introduces different
systems and different religious duties. In this age of Kali, the only incarnation of
Krsna is 67 Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and He introduced the religious duty of Kali-
yuga, the chanting of the Hare Krsna maha-mantra: Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna
Krsna, Hare Hare/Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.

SYNONYMS

sarva-jia munira vakya—the words of the omniscient muni (Vyasadeva);
sastra-paramana—evidence of revealed scriptures; ama-saba—all of us; jivera—of
the conditioned souls; haya—there is; sastra-dvara—through the medium of
revealed scriptures; jiana—knowledge.

TRANSLATION

‘The Vedic literatures composed by the omniscient Mahamuni Vyasadeva
are evidence of all spiritual existence. Only through these revealed scriptures
can all conditioned souls attain knowledge.

PURPORT

Foolish people try to concoct knowledge by manufacturing something in their
brains. That is not the real way of knowledge. Knowledge is sabda-pramana, evi-
dence from Vedic literature. Srila Vyasadeva is called Mahamuni. He is also known
as Vedavyasa because he has compiled so many sastras. He has divided the Vedas
into four divisions— Sama, Rg, Yajur and Atharva. He has expanded the Vedas into
eighteen Puranas and has summarized Vedic knowledge in the Vedanta-satra. He
also compiled the Mahabharata, which is accepted as the fifth Veda. Bhagavad-gita
is contained within the Mahabharata. Therefore Bhagavad-gita is also Vedic
literature (smrt). Some of the Vedic literatures are called $rutis, and some are
called smrtis. Srila Rapa Gosvami recommends in Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu
(1.2.101):

Sruti-smrti-puranadi-
paiicaratra-vidhim vina
aikantiki harer bhaktir
utpatayaiva kalpate

Unless one refers to sastra (Sruti, smrti and puranadi), one’s spiritual activity simply
disturbs society. There is no king or government to check people, and therefore
society has fallen into a chaotic condition as far as spiritual understanding is con-
cerned. Taking advantage of this chaotic condition, many rascals have appeared
and proclaimed themselves incarnations of God. As a result, the entire population
is indulging in sinful activities such as illicit sex, intoxication, gambling and meat-
eating. Out of many sinful people, many incarnations of God are emerging. This is
a very regrettable situation, especially in India.

who first imparted Vedic knowledge unto the heart of Brahma, the first created
being. Through Him this world, like a mirage, appears real even to great sages
and demigods. Because of Him, the material universes, created by the three
modes of nature, appear factual, although they are unreal. | meditate,
therefore, upon Him, the Absolute Truth, who is eternally existent in His tran-
scendental abode and who is forever free of illusion.”

PURPORT

This verse, quoted from $rimad-Bhagavatam (1.1.1), links the Srimad-
Bhagavatam with the Vedanta-satra with the words janmady asya yatah. It is
stated that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vasudeva, is the Absolute Truth
beyond the material creation. This has been accepted by all acaryas. Even
Sankaracarya, the most elevated impersonalist, says in the beginning of his com-
mentary on Bhagavad-gita: narayanah paro ‘vyaktat. When this material creation is
not yet manifested from the mahat-tattva, it is called avyakta, and when it is dem-
onstrated from that total energy, it is called vyakta. Narayana, the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead, is beyond this vyakta-avyakta, manifested and unmanifested
material nature. This is the chief qualification of the Supreme Personality of God-
head when He assumes a particular incarnation. Krsna tells Arjuna that they both
took birth many, many times before. Krsna remembers everything about His pre-
vious appearances, but Arjuna does not remember. Since Krsna is beyond the cos-
mic creation, He is in the exalted position of being able to remember everything in
the past. Everything within the cosmic creation has a material body, but Krsna,
being beyond the material cosmic creation, always has a spiritual body. He im-

Text 361] The Lord Instructs Sanatana Gosvami 205
parted Vedic knowledge into the heart of Brahma. Although Brahma is the most
important and exalted personality within this universe, he could not remember
what he did in his past life. Krsna has to remind him through the heart. When Lord
Brahma was thus inspired, he was able to create the entire universe. Remembering
everything about the past and inspiring Lord Brahma to create are vivid examples
of the characteristics called svarapa-laksana and tatastha-laksana.

208 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 20
PURPORT
Sanatana Gosvami wanted to confirm the fact that $f Caitanya Mahaprabhu is
the incarnation of Krsna for this age. According to $astra, in Kali-yuga the Lord
would assume a golden or yellow color and would distribute love of Krsna and
the sankirtana movement. In accordance with sastra and saintly persons, these
characteristics were vividly displayed by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and it was
therefore clear that $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu was an incarnation of Krsna. He was
confirmed by the $astras, and His characteristics were accepted by saintly people.
Since Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu could not escape Sanatana Gosvami's argument,
He remained silent on this point and thereby indirectly accepted Sanatana’s state-
ment. By this we can clearly understand that ऽं Caitanya Mahaprabhu was the
direct incarnation of Lord Krsna.

The comparison made here is very interesting. Krsna does not grow like an or-
dinary human being, even though He exhibits His pastimes of childhood, boy-
hood and pre-youth. When He reaches the age of pre-youth, kaisora, He does not
grow any older. He simply remains in His kaisora age. He is therefore described in
Brahma-sarhhita (5.33) as nava-yauvana.

This nava-yauvana, or pre-youth, is the eternal transcendental form of Krsna. Krsna
never grows older than nava-yauvana.

of Krsna’s pastimes. Krsna's pastimes are always present in the material world in
one of the many universes. These pastimes appear in the universes one after the
other, just as the sun moves across the sky and measures the time. Krsna's ap-
pearance may be manifest in this universe at one moment, and immediately after
His birth, this pastime is manifest in the next universe. After His killing of Patana is
manifest in this universe, it is next manifest in another universe. Thus all the
pastimes of Krsna are eternally existing both in the original Goloka Vrndavana
planet and in the material universes. The 125 years calculated in our solar system
to be Krsna’s lifetime equal one moment for Krsna. One moment these pastimes

224 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta {Madhya-lila, Ch. 20
are manifest in one universe, and the next moment they are manifest in the next
universe. There are unlimited universes, and Krsna's pastimes are manifest one
moment after the other in all of them. This rotation is explained through the ex-
ample of the sun’s moving across the sky. Krsna appears and disappears in innu-
merable universes, just as the sun appears and disappears during the day. Al-
though the sun appears to rise and set, it is continuously shining somewhere on
the earth. Although Krsna's pastimes seem to appear and disappear, they are con-
tinuously existing in one brahmanda (universe) or another. Thus all of Krsna’s lilas
are present simultaneously throughout the innumerable universes. By our limited
senses we cannot appreciate this; therefore Krsna's eternal pastimes are very dif-
ficult for us to understand. One should try to understand how they are taking
place by understanding the allegory of the sun. Although the Lord is appearing
constantly in the material universes, His pastimes are eternally present in the
original Goloka Vrndavana. Therefore these pastimes are called nitya-lila (eter-
nally present pastimes). Because we cannot see what is going on in other uni-
verses, it is a little difficult for us to understand how Krsna is eternally manifesting
His pastimes. There are fourteen Manus in one day of Brahma, and this time
calculation is also taking place in other universes. Krsna’s pastimes are manifest
before fourteen Manus expire. Although it is a little difficult to understand the
eternal pastimes of Krsna in this way, we must accept the verdict of Vedic
literatures.

There are two types of devotees — the sadhaka, who is preparing for perfection,
and the siddha, who is already perfect. As far as those who are already perfect are
concerned, Bhagavad-gita says, tyaktva dehar punar janma naiti mam eti so
‘rjuna: “After giving up this material body, such a devotee comes to Me.” After
leaving the material body, the perfect devotee takes birth in the womb of a gopi
on a planet where Krsna's pastimes are going on. This may be in this universe or
another universe. This statement is found in the Ujjvala-nilamani, which is com-
mented upon by Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura. When a devotee becomes per-
fect, he is transferred to the universe where Krsna’'s pastimes are taking place.
Krsna’'s eternal associates go wherever Krsna manifests His pastimes. As stated
before, first the father and mother of Krsna appear, then the other associates.
Quitting his material body, the perfect devotee also goes to associate with Krsna
and His other associates.

CHAPTER 21
The Opulence and Sweetness of Lord Sri Krsna
Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura gives the following summary study of the Twenty-first
Chapter. In this chapter जा Caitanya Mahaprabhu fully describes Krsnaloka, the
spiritual sky, the Causal Ocean and the material world, which consists of innumer-
able universes. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu then describes Lord Brahma's interview
with Krsna at Dvaraka and the Lord's curbing the pride of Brahma. There is also a
description of one of Krsna's pastimes with Brahma. In this chapter the author of
Caitanya-caritamrta has presented some nice poems about the pastimes of Krsna
and Krsna's superexcellent beauty. Throughout the rest of the chapter, our inti-
mate relationship (sambandha) with Krsna is described.

planetary systems, including Lord Brahma, could not find Your limitations. Nor
could You Yourself ascertain the limit of Your qualities. Like atoms in the sky,
there are multi-universes with seven coverings, and these are rotating in due
course of time. All the experts in Vedic understanding are searching for You
by eliminating the material elements. In this way, searching and searching,
they come to the conclusion that everything is complete in You. Thus You are
the resort of everything. This is the conclusion of all Vedic experts.”

PURPORT
This verse from S$rimad-Bhagavatam (10.87.41) is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita:
bahanar janmanam ante
jAdnavan marh prapadyate
vasudevah sarvam iti
sa mahatma sudurlabhah
“After many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto
Me, knowing Me to be the cause of all causes and all that is. Such a great soul is
very rare.” (Bg. 7.19)

After searching for the Absolute Truth throughout the universe, learned schol-
ars and Vedic experts cannot reach the ultimate goal. In this way they come to
Krsna.

When there is a discussion about the Absolute Truth, there are always various
pros and cons. The purpose of such arguments is to come to the right conclusion.
Such an argument is generally known as neti neti (“not this, not that”). Until one
comes to the right conclusion, the process of thinking, “This is not the Absolute
Truth, that is not the Absolute Truth,” will continue. When we come to the right

mate truth.

TRANSLATION

‘“We do not hear of such wonderful things anywhere. Simply by hearing of

those incidents, one’s consciousness is agitated and cleansed.
, PURPORT

When Lord Krsna was present in the earthly Vrndavana, Lord Brahma, taking
Him to be an ordinary cowherd boy, wanted to test His potency. Therefore Lord
Brahma stole all the cows, calves and cowherd boys from Krsna and hid them by
his illusory energy. When Krsna saw that Brahma had stolen His cows, calves and
cowherd boys, He immediately created many material and spiritual planets in Lord
Brahma’s presence. Within a moment, cows, cowherd boys, calves and unlimited
Vaikunthas — all expansions of the Lord's spiritual energy —were manifested. As
stated in the Brahma-sarnhita: ananda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhavitabhih. Not only
did Krsna create all the paraphernalia of His spiritual energy, but He also created
unlimited material universes with unlimited Brahmas. All these pastimes, which
are described in Srimad-Bhagavatam, will cleanse one’s consciousness. In this way
one can actually understand the Absolute Truth. The spiritual planets in the
spiritual sky are called Vaikunthas, and each of them has a predominating Deity
(Narayana) with a specific name. Similarly, in the material sky there are innumer-
able universes, and each is dominated by a specific deity, a Brahma. Krsna
simultaneously created all these Vaikuntha planets and universes within a
moment of Brahma's return.

The word avadhdta means “rambling, agitating, moving, absorbed, defeated.”
In some readings of Caitanya-caritamrta, it is said: yahara sravane citta-mala haya
dhata. Instead of the word avadhata, the words haya 00039, meaning that the
heart or consciousness is cleansed, is used. When the consciousness is cleansed,
one can understand what and who Krsna is. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-
gita (7.28):

“Persons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life, whose sinful ac-
tions are completely eradicated and who are freed from the duality of delusion,
engage themselves in My service with determination.”
Unless one is freed from the reaction of sinful activities, one cannot understand
Krsna or engage in His transcendental loving service.

TRANSLATION
‘Each of the cowherd boys was tending calves to the extent of a koti, ar-
buda, sankha and padma. That is the way of counting.
PURPORT
According to Vedic mathematical calculations, the following enumeration
system is used: units, tens (dasa), hundreds (sata), thousands (sahasra), ten thou-
sands (ayuta) and hundred thousands (laksa). Ten times laksa is niyuta. Ten times
niyutais koti. Ten times koti is arbuda.. Ten times arbuda is vrnda. Ten times vrnda
15 kharva. Ten times kharva 15 nikharva. Ten times nikharva is sarnkha. Ten times
Sankha 15 padma, and ten times padma 15 sagara. Ten times sagara 15 antya, and ten
times antya is madhya, and ten times madhya is parardha. Each item is ten times
greater than the previous one. Thus all the cowherd boys who were companions
of Krsna had many calves to take care of.

offered the above prayer.

In the spiritual sky there is neither anxiety nor fear. It is eternally existing, and it
consists of three fourths of the Lord's energy. The material world is an exhibition
of only one fourth of the Lord's energy. Therefore it is called eka-pada-vibhati.

the conditioned living entities; yara—of which; vasi—the inhabitants; jagat-

TRANSLATION
“The abode of the external energy is called Devi-dhama, and its inhabitants
are conditioned souls. It is there that the material energy, Durga, resides with
many opulent maidservants.
PURPORT
Because he wants to enjoy the material energy, the conditioned soul is allowed
to reside in Devi-dhama, the external energy, where the goddess Durga carries
out the orders of the Supreme Lord as His maidservant. The material energy is
called jagal-laksmi because she protects the bewildered conditioned souls. The
goddess Durga is therefore known as the mother, and Lord Siva, her husband, is
known as the father. Lord Siva and goddess Durga are therefore known as the ma-
terial father and mother. Goddess Durga is so named because this material world
is like a big fort where the conditioned soul is placed under her care. For material
facilities, the conditioned soul tries to please the goddess Durga, and mother
Durga supplies all kinds of material facilities. Because of this, the conditioned souls
are allured and do not wish to leave the external energy. Consequently they are
continuously making plans to live here peacefully and happily. Such is the material
world.

Vindavana-dhama, Vaikuntha-dhama (Hari-dhama) and Devi-dhama (the material
world); haya—is; krsna—Lord Krsna; adhisvara—the supreme master; goloka-

PURPORT
When a living entity is liberated from Devi-dhama but does not know of the
opulence of Hari-dhama, he is placed in Mahesa-dhama, which is between the
other two dhamas. The liberated soul does not get an opportunity to serve the
Supreme Personality of Godhead there; therefore although this Mahesa-dhama is
Lord Siva’s dhama and above the Devi-dhama, it is not the spiritual world. The
spiritual world begins with Hari-dhama, or Vaikunthaloka.

TRANSLATION
“Actually it is very difficult to ascertain the number of universes. Every uni-
verse has its separate Lord Brahma and Lord Siva, who are known as perma-
nent governors. Therefore there is also no counting of them.
PURPORT
Lord Brahma and Lord Siva are called cira-loka-pala, permanent governors. This
means that they govern the affairs of the universe from the beginning of the crea-
tion to the end. In the next creation, the same living entities may not be present,
but because Brahma and Siva are existing from the beginning to the end, they are
called cira-loka-pala, permanent governors. Loka-pdla means “predominating
deities.” There are eight predominating deities of the prominent heavenly planets,
and they are Indra, Agni, Yama, Varuna, Nirrti, Vayu, Kuvera and Siva.

very ashamed, Indra fell down at the lotus feet of the great sage and begged his
pardon. Being compassionate, the sage turned the vaginas into eyes; therefore In-
dra possesses hundreds and thousands of eyes all over his body. Just as Lord
Brahma and Lord Siva have many faces, the King of heaven, Indra, has many eyes.

confidential; ara—another; haya—there is; tri-sabde—by the word “three”;

TRANSLATION
“There is a very deep meaning in the word tryadhisvara, which indicates
that Krsna possesses three different lokas, or natures.
PURPORT
The word tryadhisvara means “proprietor of the three worlds.” There are three
worlds of which Krsna is the supreme proprietor. This is explained in Bhagavad-
gita:
bhoktararn yajia-tapasam
sarva-loka-mahesvaram
suhrdari sarva-bhatanari
jAatva marn santim rcchati
“The sages, knowing Me as the ultimate purpose of all sacrificies and austerities,
the Supreme Lord of all planets and demigods and the benefactor and well-wisher
of all living entities, attain peace from the pangs of material miseries.” (Bg. 5.29)
The word sarva-loka means “all three worlds,” and the word mahesvara means
“the supreme proprietor.” Krsna is the proprietor of both material and spiritual
worlds. The spiritual world is divided into two portions —Coloka Vrndavana and
the Vaikunthas. The material world is a combination of universes unlimited in
number.

TRANSLATION
‘“‘To exhibit the strength of His own spiritual potency, Lord Krsna
manifested a suitable form just for His pastimes in the material world. This
form was wonderful even for Him and was the supreme abode of the wealth of
good fortune. Its limbs were so beautiful that they increased the beauty of the
ornaments worn on different parts of His body.’
PURPORT
This verse from S$rimad-Bhagavatam (3.2.12) is stated in a conversation be-
tween Vidura and Uddhava. Uddhava thus begins his description of the pastimes
of Sri Krsna in His form exhibited by yogamaya.

“The wonder of Krsna in His personal feature is so great that it attracts even
Krsna to taste His own association. Thus Krsna becomes very eager to taste
that wonder. Total beauty, knowledge, wealth, strength, fame and renuncia-
tion are the six opulences of Krsna. He is eternally situated in His opulences.
PURPORT
Krsna has many pastimes, of which His pastimes in Goloka Vindavana (the
gokula-lila) are supreme. He also has pastimes in the Vaikunthas, the spiritual


--- Page 289 ---
Text 105] The Opulence and Sweetness of Krsna 287
world, as Vasudeva, Sankarsana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha. In His pastimes in the
spiritual sky, He lies down in the Causal Ocean as Karanarnavasayi, the purusa-
avatara. His incarnations as a fish, tortoise and so on are called His causal incarna-
tions. He incarnates in the modes of nature as Lord Brahma, Lord Siva and Lord
Visnu. He also incarnates as empowered living entities like Prthu and Vyasa. The
Supersoul is His localized incarnation, and His all-pervasive aspect is the imper-
sonal Brahman.

When we consider impartially all the unlimited pastimes of the Lord, we find
that His pastimes as a human being on this planet —wherein He sports as a
cowherd boy with a flute in His hands and appears youthful and fresh like a ballet
dancer—are pastimes and features that are never subjected to material laws and
inebrieties. The wonderful beauty of Krsna is presented in the supreme planet,
Gokula (Goloka Vindavana). Inferior to that is His representation in the spiritual
sky, and inferior to that is His representation in the external energy (Devi-dhama).
A mere drop of Krsna's sweetness can drown these three worlds—Goloka
Vrndavana, Hari-dhama (Vaikunthaloka), and Devi-dhama (the material world).
Everywhere, Krsna's beauty merges everyone in the ecstasy of transcendental
bliss. Actually the activities of yogamaya are absent in the spiritual sky and the
Vaikuntha planets. She simply works in the supreme planet, Goloka Vrndavana,
and she works to manifest the activities of Krsna when He descends to the ma-
terial universe to please His innumerable devotees within the material world. Thus
a replica of the Goloka Vrndavana planet and the pastimes there are manifest on
this planet on a specific tract of land —Bhauma Vrndavana, the Vrndavana-dhama
on this planet.

TRANSLATION
“Ornaments caress that body, but the transcendental body of Krsna is so
beautiful that it beautifies the ornaments He wears. Therefore Krsna’s body is
said to be the ornament of ornaments. Despite the wonderful beauty of Krsna,
there is His three-curved style of standing, which beautifies that form. Above
all these beautiful features, Krsna's eyes dance and move obliquely, acting
like arrows to pierce the minds of Srimati Radharani and the gopis. When the
arrow succeeds in hitting its target, their minds become agitated.

‘’Favoring them, Krsna rides on the chariot of the minds of the gopis, and
just to receive loving service from them, He attracts their minds like Cupid.
Therefore He is also called Madana-mohana, the attractor of Cupid. Cupid has
five arrows, representing form, taste, smell, sound and touch. Krsna is the
owner of these five arrows, and with His Cupid-like beauty, He conquers the
minds of the gopis, though they are very proud of their superexcellent beauty.
Becoming a new Cupid, Krsna attracts their minds and engages in the rasa
dance.

grains receive life from the rains.

Text 119] The Opulence and Sweetness of Krsna 297
SYNONYMS

gopi-bhava-darapana—the gopis’ ecstasy is like a mirror; nava nava ksane
ksana—newer and newer at every moment; tara age —in front of that; krsnera
madhurya—the sweetness of Krsna's beauty; donhe—both; kare —do;
hudahudi—struggling together; bade —increases; mukha nahi mudi—never
turning away the faces; nava nava—newer and newer; dorhara—of both of
them; pracurya—abundance.

TRANSLATION

‘Both the gopis and Krsna are complete. The gopis’ ecstatic love is like a
mirror that becomes newer and newer at every moment and reflects Krsna’s
bodily luster and sweetness. Thus competition increases. Since neither give
up, their pastimes become newer and newer, and both sides constantly
increase.

obstacles that impeded one from seeing that beauty. For this reason, men and
women became very angry at the creator [Lord Brahmal.’

and | wish to drink that entire ocean, the repressive physician does not allow
Me to drink even one drop.
PURPORT
When there is a combination of kapha, pitta and vayu, the three bodily ele-
ments, there occurs sannipati, or a convulsive disease. “This disease is caused by
the personal features of Lord Krsna. The three elements are the beauty of Krsna's
body, the beauty of His face, and the beauty of His smile. Stricken by these three
beauties, My mind goes into convulsions. It wishes to drink the ocean of Krsna's
beauty, but because | am undergoing convulsions, My physician, who is Sri Krsna
Himself, does not even allow Me to take a drop of water from that ocean.” Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu was ecstatic in this way because He was presenting Him-
self in the mood of the gopis. The gopis wanted to drink the ocean of sweetness
arising from the bodily features of Krsna, but Krsna did not allow them to come
near. Consequently their desire to meet Krsna increased, and being unable to
drink the ambrosia of Krsna's bodily features, they became very unhappy.

Text 145] The Opulence and Sweetness of Krsna 315
PURPORT
The vibration of Krsna's flute is always prominent in the ears of the gopis.
Naturally they cannot hear anything else. Constant remembrance of the holy
sound of Krsna's flute keeps them enlightened and enlivened, and they do not
allow any other sound to enter their ears. Since their attention is fixed on Krsna’'s
flute, they-cannot divert their minds to any other subject. In other words, a devo-
tee who has heard the sound of Krsna's flute forgets to talk or hear of any other
subject. This vibration of Krsna's flute is represented by the Hare Krsna maha-
mantra. A serious devotee of the Lord who chants and hears this transcendental
vibration becomes so accustomed to it that he cannot divert his attention to any
subject matter not related to Krsna's blissful characteristics and paraphernalia.

Resuming His external consciousness, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu told
Sanatana Gosvami, “| have not spoken of what 1 intended. Lord Krsna is very

Me for your understanding.

Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu admitted that He was speaking like a madman, which
He should not have done for the understanding of those who are externally situ-
ated. Statements about Krsna’s body, His characteristics and His flute would ap-
pear like ৪ madman’s statements to a mundane person. It was actually a fact that
Krsna wanted to expose Himself to Sanatana Gosvami due to His specific mercy
upon him. Somehow or other, Krsna explained Himself and His flute to Sanatana
Gosvami through the mouth of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who appeared as
though mad. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu admitted that He wanted to tell Sanatana
Cosvami something else, but somehow or other, in a transcendental ecstasy, He
spoke of a different subject matter.

CHAPTER 22

The Process of Devotional Service
In this Twenty-second Chapter, ऽ Caitanya Mahaprabhu describes the process of
devotional service. In the beginning He describes the truth about the living entity
and the superexcellence of devotional service. He then describes the uselessness
of mental speculation and mystic yoga. In all circumstances the living entity is
recommended to accept the path of devotional service as personally explained by
Sr Caitanya Mahaprabhu. The speculative method of the so-called janis is con-
sidered a waste of time, and that is proved in this chapter. An intelligent person
should abandon the processes of karma-kanda, jAana-kanda and mystic yoga.
One should give up all these useless processes and take seriously to the path of
Krsna consciousness. In this way one’s life will be successful. If one takes to Krsna
consciousness fully, even though he may sometimes be agitated due to having
previously practiced mental speculation and yogic mysticism, he will be saved by
Lord Krsna Himself. The fact is that devotional service is bestowed by the
blessings of a pure devotee (sa mahatma sudurlabhah). A pure devotee is the
supreme transcendentalist, and one has to receive his mercy for one’s dormant
Krsna consciousness to be awakened. One has to associate with pure devotees. If
one has firm faith in the words of a great soul, pure devotional service will
awaken.

In this chapter $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has differentiated between a pure
devotee and others. He also describes the characteristics of a pure devotee. A
devotee’s most formidable enemy is association with women in an enjoying spirit.
Association with nondevotees is also condemned because it is also a formidable
enemy on the path of devotional service. One has to fully surrender unto the
lotus feet of Krsna and give up attraction for women and nondevotees.

The six symptoms of fully surrendered souls are also described in this chapter.
Devotional service has been divided into two categories —regulative devotional
service and spontaneous love. There are sixty-four items listed in regulative devo-
tional service, and out of these sixty-four the last five are considered very impor-
tant. By practicing even one of the nine processes of devotional service, one can
become successful. Speculative knowledge and mystic yoga can never help one
in devotional service. Pious activity, nonviolence, sense control and regulation are
not separate from devotional service in its pure form. If one engages in devotional
service, all good qualities follow. One does not have to cultivate them separately.
Spontaneous devotional service arises when one follows a pure devotee who is
awakened to spontaneous love of God. 5 Caitanya Mahaprabhu has described

319


--- Page 322 ---
320 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 22
the symptoms of devotees who are already situated in spontaneous love of God.
He has also described the devotees who are trying to follow in the footsteps of
the pure devotees.

PURPORT

The personal expansions are known as visnu-tattva, and the separated expan-
sions are known as jiva-tattva. Although the jivas (living entities) are part and
parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they are still counted among His
multi-potencies. This is fully described in Bhagavad-gita:

apareyam itas tv anyarn
prakrtirh viddhi me param
jiva-bhatam maha-baho
yayedari dharyate jagat
“Besides this inferior nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is a superior energy of
Mine, which consists of all living entities who are struggling with material nature
and are sustaining the universe.” (Bg. 7.5)

Although the living entities are Krsna's parts and parcels, they are prakrti, not
purusa. Sometimes prakrti (a living entity) attempts to imitate the activities of the
purusa. Due to a poor fund of knowledge, living entities conditioned in this ma-
terial world claim to be God. They are thus illusioned. A living entity cannot be on
the level of a visnu-tattva, or the Personality of Godhead, at any stage; therefore it
is ludicrous for a living entity to claim to be God. Advanced spiritualists would
never accept such a thing. Such claims are made to cheat ordinary, foolish people.
The Krsna consciousness movement declares war against such bogus incarna-
tions. The bogus propaganda put out by people claiming to be God has killed God
consciousness all over the world. Members of the Krsna consciousness movement
must be very alert to defy these rascals who are presently misleading the whole
world. One such rascal, known as Paundraka, appeared before Lord Krsna, and the
Lord immediately killed him. Of course, those who are Krsna’s servants cannot kill
such imitation gods, but they should try their best to defeat them through the evi-
dence of sastra, authentic knowledge received through the disciplic succession.

“In this way the conditioned soul becomes the servant of lusty desires, and
when these are not fulfilled, he becomes a servant of anger and continues to
be kicked by the external energy, maya. Wandering and wandering
throughout the universe, he may by chance get the association of a devotee
physician, whose instructions and hymns make the witch of external energy
flee. The conditioned soul thus gets into touch with the devotional service of
Lord Krsna, and in this way he can approach nearer and nearer to the Lord.

PURPORT

An explanation of verses 8 through 15 is given by Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura in
his Amrta-pravaha-bhasya. The Lord is spread throughout the creation in His
quadruple expansions and incarnations. Krsna is fully represented with all poten-
cies in each and every personal extension, but the living entities, although sepa-
rated expansions, are also considered one of the Lord's energies. The living en-
tities are divided into two categories —the eternally liberated and eternally condi-
tioned. Those who are ever-liberated never come in contact with may3, the exter-
nal energy. The ever-conditioned are always under the clutches of the external
energy. This is described in Bhagavad-gita:

daivi hy esa gupnamayi

mama maya duratyaya
“This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is
difficult to overcome.” (Bg. 7.14)

The nitya-baddhas are always conditioned by the external energy, and the
nitya-muktas never come in contact with the external energy. Sometimes an ever-
liberated personal associate of the Supreme Personality of Godhead descends
into this universe just as the Lord descends. Although working for the liberation of
conditioned souls, the messenger of the Supreme Lord remains untouched by the
material energy. Generally ever-liberated personalities live in the spiritual world as
associates of Lord Krsna, and they are known as krsna-pdrisada, associates of the
Lord. Their only business is enjoying Lord Krsna’s company, and even though such
eternally liberated persons come within this material world to serve the Lord's
purpose, they enjoy Lord Krsna’s company without stoppage. The ever-liberated
person who works on Krsna’s behalf enjoys Lord Krsna's company through his
engagement. The ever-conditioned soul, provoked by lusty desires to enjoy the
material world, is subjected to transmigrate from one body to another. Sometimes
he is elevated to higher planetary systems, and sometimes he is degraded to
hellish planets and subjected to the tribulations of the external energy.

Due to being conditioned by the external energy, the conditioned soul within
this material world gets two kinds of bodies —a gross material body and a subtle


--- Page 331 ---
Text 16] The Process of Devotional Service 329
body composed of mind, intelligence and ego. Due to the gross and subtle
bodies, he is subjected to the threefold miseries (ddhyatmika, adhibhautika and
adhidaivika), miseries arising from the body and mind, other living entities, and
natural disturbances caused by demigods from higher planetary systems. The con-
ditioned soul subjected to the threefold material miseries is ceaselessly kicked by
maya, and this is his disease. If by chance he meets a saintly person who works on
Krsna's behalf to deliver conditioned souls, and if he agrees to abide by his order,
he can gradually approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna.

This verse is also quoted in Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu (3.2.35). When we chant
the Hare Krsna maha-mantra we are saying, “Hare! O energy of the Lord! O my
Lord Krsna!” In this way we are simply addressing the Lord and His spiritual poten-
cy represented as Radha-Krsna, Sita-Rama, or Laksmi-Narayana. The devotee al-
ways prays to the Lord and His internal energy (consort) so that he may engage in
Their transcendental loving service. When the conditioned soul attains his real
spiritual energy and fully surrenders unto the Lord's lotus feet, he tries to engage
in the Lord's service. This is the real constitutional position of the living entity.

TRANSLATION
‘‘But for devotional service, all other methods for spiritual self-realization
are weak and insignificant. Unless one comes to the devotional service of Lord
Krsna, jana and yoga cannot give the desired results.
PURPORT
In Vedic scriptures, stress is sometimes given to fruitive activity, speculative
knowledge and the mystic yoga system. Although people are inclined to practice
these processes, they cannot attain the desired results without being touched by
krsna-bhakti, devotional service. In other words, the real desired result is to invoke
dormant love for Krsna. Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.6) states:
sa vai (2८111557) paro dharmo
yato bhaktir adhoksaje
ahaituky apratihata
yayatma suprasidati
Karma, jana and yoga cannot actually awaken love of Godhead. One has to take
to the Lord's devotional service, and the more one is inclined to devotional ser-
vice, the more he loses interest in other so-called achievements. Dhruva Maharaja
went to practice mystic yoga to see the Lord personally face to face, but when he
developed an interest in devotional service, he saw that he was not being
benefited by karma, jiana and yoga.

This is a quotation from Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.5.12). Even after writing many
Vedic literatures, Vyasadeva felt very morose. Therefore his spiritual master,
Naradadeva, told him that he could be happy by writing about the activities of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Up to that time, Srila Vyasadeva had written
the karma-kanda and jAana-kanda sections of the Vedas, but he had not written
about upasana-kanda, or bhakti. Thus his spiritual master, Narada, chastised him
and advised him to write about the activities of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Therefore Vyasadeva began writing Srimad-Bhagavatam.

334 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 22
PURPORT
One cannot attain liberation simply by speculative knowledge. Even though
one may be able to distinguish between Brahman and matter, one’s liberation will
be hampered if one is misled into thinking that the living entity is as good as the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Indeed, one falls down again onto the material
platform because considering oneself the Supreme Person, the Supreme Absolute
Truth, is offensive. When such a person comes in contact with a pure devotee, he
can actually become liberated from material bondage and engage in the Lord's
service. A prayer by Bilvamangala Thakura is relevant here:
bhaktis tvayi sthiratara bhagavan yadi syad
daivena nah phalati divya-kisora-martih
muktih svayam mukulitanjalih sevate 'sman
dharmartha-kama-gatayah samaya-pratiksah
“O my Lord, if one engages in Your pure devotional service with determination,
You become visible in Your original transcendental youthful form as the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. As far as liberation is concerned, she stands before the
devotee with folded hands waiting to render service. Religion, economic develop-
ment and sense gratification are all automatically attained without separate en-
deavor.”

It is a fact that every living entity is eternally a servant of Krsna. This is forgotten
due to the influence of maya, which induces one to believe in material happiness.
Being illusioned by maya, one thinks that material happiness is the only desirable
object. This material consciousness is like a chain around the neck of the condi-
tioned soul. As long as he is bound to that conception, he cannot get out of
maya’s clutches. However, if by Krsna’s mercy he gets in touch with a bona fide
spiritual master, abides by his order and serves him, engaging other conditioned
souls in the Lord's service, he then attains liberation and Lord ri Krsna’s shelter.

Without developing one’s dormant Krsna consciousness, one cannot be factually
elevated. The regulative principles of varpasrama-dharma in themselves are in-
sufficient for attainment of the highest perfection. That is confirmed in the
following two quotations from Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.5.2-3).

planet; maya—the illusory energy; haya—is; andhakara—darkness; yahan
krsna—wherever there is Krsna; tahan—there; nahi—not; mayara—of maya, or

TRANSLATION
“Krsna is compared to sunshine, and maya is compared to darkness.
Wherever there is sunshine, there cannot be darkness. As soon as one takes to
Krsna consciousness, the darkness of illusion (the influence of the external
energy) will immediately vanish.
PURPORT
In Srimad-Bhagavatam (2.9.34) it is stated:
rte ‘rtharn yat pratiyeta
na pratiyeta catmani
tad vidyad atmano mayam
yathabhaso yatha tamah
Wherever there is light, there cannot be darkness. When a living entity becomes
Krsna conscious, he is immediately relieved of all material lusty desires. Lusty
desires and greed are associated with rajas and tamas, darkness and passion.
When one becomes Krsna conscious, the modes of darkness and passion im-
mediately vanish, and the remaining mode, sattva-guna (goodness), remains.
When one is situated in the mode of goodness, he can make spiritual advance-
ment and understand things clearly. This position is not possible for everyone.

Text 32] The Process of Devotional Service 341
When a person is Krsna conscious, he continuously hears about Krsna, thinks
about Him, worships Him and serves Him as a devotee. If he remains in Krsna con-
sciousness in this way, the darkness of maya certainly will not be able to touch
him.

pathe—in the line of sight; amuya—by that (maya); vimohitah—bewildered;
vikatthante —boast; mama—my; aham—I; iti—thus; durdhiyah—having poor in-

TRANSLATION
^“ ‘The external illusory energy of Krsna, known as maya, is always ashamed
to stand in front of Krsna, just as darkness is ashamed to remain before the
sunshine. However, that maya bewilders unfortunate people who have no in-
telligence. Thus they simply boast that this material world is theirs and that
they are its enjoyers.’
PURPORT
The entire world is bewildered because people are thinking, “This is my land,”
“America is mine,” “India is mine.” Not knowing the real value of life, people think
that the material body and the land where it is produced are all in all. This is the
basic principle behind nationalism, socialism and communism. Such thinking,
which simply bewilders the living being, is nothing but rascalism. It is due to the
darkness of maya, but 25 soon as one becomes Krsna conscious, he 15 immediately
relieved from such misconceptions. This verse is quoted from Srimad-Bhagavatam
(2.5.13). There is also another appropriate verse in Srimad-Bhagavatam (2.7.47):

maya paraity abhimukhe ca vilajjamana

tad vai pada bhagavatah paramasya purnso

brahmeti yad vidur ajasra-sukham visokam
“What is realized as the Absolute Brahman is full of unlimited bliss without grief.
That is certainly the ultimate phase of the supreme enjoyer, the Personality of
Godhead. He is eternally void of all disturbances, fearless, completely conscious
as opposed to matter, uncontaminated and without distinctions. He is the prin-
cipal, primeval cause of all causes and effects, in whom there is no sacrifice for
fruitive activities and in whom the illusory energy does not stand.”

This verse was spoken by Lord Brahma when he was questioned by the great
sage Narada. Narada was surprised to see the creator of the universe meditating,
for he was doubting whether there was someone greater than Lord Brahma.
While answering the great sage Narada, Lord Brahma described the position of
maya and the bewildered living entities. This verse was spoken in that connection.

PURPORT
Those who are interested in material enjoyment are known as bhukti. One who
is interested in merging into the effulgence of Brahman or perfecting the mystic
yoga system is not a devotee at all. Devotees do not have such desires. However,


--- Page 348 ---
346 $ri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 22
if a karmi, jAiani or yogi somehow contacts a devotee and renders devotional ser-
vice, Krsna immediately awards him love of God and gives him shelter at His lotus
feet, although he may have no idea how to develop love of Krsna. If a person
wants material profit from devotional service, Krsna condemns such materialistic
desires. To desire material opulence while engaging in devotional service is
foolish. Although the person may be foolish, Krsna, being all-intelligent, engages
him in His devotional service in such a way that he gradually forgets material opu-
lence. The point is that we should not try to exchange loving service for material
prosperity. If we are actually surrendered to the lotus feet of Krsna, our only desire
should be to satisfy Krsna. That is pure Krsna consciousness. Surrender does not
mean that we demand something from the Lord but that we completely depend
on His mercy.

350 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 22
PURPORT
Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura explains this point. Is this bhagya (fortune) the result
of an accident or something else? In the scriptures, devotional service and pious
activity are considered fortunate. Pious activities can be divided into three
categories —pious activities that awaken one’s dormant Krsna consciousness are
called bhakty-unmukhi sukrti. Pious activities that bestow material opulence are
called bhogonmukhi, and pious activities that enable the living entity to merge
into the existence of the Supreme are called moksonmukhi. These last two
awards of pious activity are not actually fortunate. Pious activities are fortunate
when they help one become Krsna conscious. The good fortune of bhakty-un-
mukhi is attainable only when one comes in contact with a devotee. By asso-
ciating with a devotee willingly or unwillingly, one advances in devotional service,
and thus one’s dormant Krsna consciousness is awakened.

354 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 22
PURPORT

Pious activities bring about material opulence, but one cannot acquire devo-
tional service by any amount of material pious activity, not by giving charity,
opening big hospitals and schools or working philanthropically. Devotional service
can be attained only by the mercy of a pure devotee. Without a pure devotee’s
mercy, one cannot even escape the bondage of material existence. The word
mahat in this verse means “a pure devotee.” As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita:

mahatmanas tu marn partha
daivirh prakrtim asritah
bhajanty ananya-manaso
jAatva bhatadim avyayam
“QO son of Prtha, those who are not deluded, the great souls, are under the protec-
tion of the divine nature. They are fully engaged in devotional service because
they know Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, original and inexhaust-
ible.” (Bg. 9.13)

One also has to associate with such a mahatma who has accepted Krsna as the
supreme source of the entire creation. Without being a mahatma, one cannot
understand Krsna’'s absolute position. A mahatma is rare and transcendental, and
he is a pure devotee of Lord Krsna. Foolish people consider Krsna a human being,
and they consider Lord Krsna's pure devotee an ordinary human being also. What-
ever one may be, one must take shelter at the lotus feet of a devotee mahatma
and treat him as the most exalted well-wisher of all human society. We should
take shelter of such a mahatma and ask for his causeless mercy. Only by his
benediction can one be relieved from attachment to a materialistic way of life.
When one is thus relieved, he can engage in the Lord's transcendental loving ser-
vice through the mercy of the mahatma.

service. Devotional service is not possible to attain simply by undergoing
severe austerities and penances, by gorgeously worshiping the Deity, or by
strictly following the rules and regulations of the sannyasa or grhastha order,
nor by studying the Vedas, submerging oneself in water, or exposing oneself
to fire or scorching sunlight.’
PURPORT
This verse appears in S$rimad-Bhagavatam (5.12.12). Jada Bharata herein tells
King Rahtigana how he attained the paramahamsa stage. Maharaja ২৭170839179, the
King of Sindhu-sauvira, had asked Jada Bharata how he had attained the
paramaharisa stage. The King had called him to carry his palanquin, but when the
King heard from paramaharisa Jada Bharata about the supreme philosophy, he ex-
pressed surprise and asked Jada Bharata how he had attained such great libera-
tion. At that time Jada Bharata informed the King how to become detached from
material attraction.

PURPORT

This verse appears in the Srimad-Bhagavatam (7.5.32). When the great sage
Narada was giving instructions to Maharaja Yudhisthira, he narrated the activities
of Prahlada Maharaja. This verse was spoken by Prahlada Maharaja to his father,
Hiranyakasipu, the king of demons. Prahlada Maharaja informed his father of the
nine basic processes of bhakti-yoga. Whoever takes to these processes is to be
considered a highly learned scholar. Hiranyakasipu, however, did not like his son
to talk about devotional service; therefore he immediately called his teacher, San-
damarka. The teacher explained that he did not teach devotional service to
Prahlada but that the boy was naturally inclined that way. At that time
Hiranyakasipu became very angry and asked Prahlada why he had become a
Vaisnava. In answer to this question, Prahlada Maharaja recited this verse to the
effect that one cannot become the Lord's devotee without receiving the mercy
and blessings of another devotee.

This is a quotation from $rimad-Bhagavatam (1.18.13). This verse concerns the
Vedic rites and sacrifices performed by the great sages of Naimisaranya, headed
by Saunaka Rsi. The sages pointed out that association with a devotee for even
less than a second is beyond comparison to a thousand Vedic rituals and
sacrifices, elevation to heavenly planets or merging into the existence of the
Supreme.

“By rendering transcendental loving service to Krsna, one automatically

PURPORT
Firm faith and confidence are called sraddha. When one engages in the Lord's
devotional service, he is to be understood to have performed all his respon-
sibilities in the material world. He has satisfied his forefathers, ordinary living en-
tities, and demigods and is free from all responsibility. Such a person does not
need to meet his responsibilities separately. It is automatically done. Fruitive ac-
tivity (karma) is meant to satisfy the senses of the conditioned soul. However,
when one awakens to Krsna consciousness, he does not have to work separately
for pious activity. The best achievement of all fruitive activity is detachment from
material life, and this detachment is spontaneously enjoyed by the devotee firmly
engaged in the Lord's service.

ries —uttama, madhyama and kanistha (first-class, second-class and neophyte). A
first-class devotee has firm conviction in the revealed scriptures and is expert in
arguing according to the sastras. He is firmly convinced of the science of Krsna
consciousness. The madhyama-adhikari, or second-class devotee, has firm con-
viction in Krsna consciousness, but he cannot support his conviction by citing
5३51116 references. The neophyte devotee does not yet have firm faith. In this way
the devotees are typed.

The standard of devotion is also categorized in the same way. A neophyte
believes that only love of Krsna or Krsna consciousness is very good, but he may
not know the basis of pure Krsna consciousness or how one can become a perfect
devotee. Sometimes in the heart of a neophyte there is attraction for karma, jAiana
or yoga. When he is free and transcendental to mixed devotional activity, he be-
comes a second-class devotee. When he becomes expert in logic and can refer to
the sastras, he becomes a first-class devotee. The devotees are also described as
positive, comparative and superlative, in terms of their love and attachment for
Krsna.

It should be understood that a madhyama-adhikari, a second-class devotee, is
fully convinced of Krsna consciousness but cannot support his convictions with
5351116 reference. A neophyte may fall down by associating with nondevotees be-
cause he is not firmly convinced and strongly situated. The second-class devotee,
even though he cannot support his position with 3astric reference, can gradually
become a first-class devotee by studying the sastras and associating with a first-
class devotee. However, if the second-class devotee does not advance himself by
associating with a first-class devotee, he makes no progress. There is no possibility
that a first-class devotee will fall down, even though he may mix with non-
devotees to preach. Conviction and faith gradually increase to make one an ut-
tama-adhikari, a first-class devotee.

from his family who worships the Deity. He is to be considered on the material
platform, although he is trying to advance in devotional service. Such a person
is a bhakta-praya [neophyte devoteel, or bhaktabhasa, for he is a little en-

PURPORT
This verse is from Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.2.47). Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura says
that one who has full love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead and who
maintains a good friendship with the Lord's devotees is always callous to those
who envy Krsna and Krsna's devotees. Such a person is to be considered an inter-
mediate devotee. He becomes a first-class devotee when, in the course of ad-
vancing in devotional service, he feels an intimate relationship with all living en-
tities, seeing them as part and parcel of the Supreme Person.

This is a quotation from Srimad-Bhagavatam (3.25.21). When the sages, headed

realization between Maitreya, a friend of Vyasadeva, and Vidura. It was then that
the topic of Lord Kapila came up and His discussions with His mother, wherein He
stated that attachment to material things is the cause of conditional life. When a
person becomes attached to transcendental things, he is on the path of liberation.

PURPORT
These verses, quoted from $rimad-Bhagavatam (3.31.33-35), were spoken by
Kapiladeva, an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, to His mother.
Herein Kapiladeva discusses pious and impious activities and the symptoms of
those who are devoid of devotional service to Krsna. Generally people do not
know about the miserable conditions within the womb of a mother in any species
of life. Due to bad association, one gradually falls into lower species. Association
with women is greatly stressed in this regard. When one becomes attached to
women or to those who are attached to women, one falls down into the lower
species.

“The living entity in material nature thus follows the ways of life, enjoying the
three modes of nature. This is due to his association with that material nature.
Thus he meets with good and evil among various species.” (Bhagavad-gita13.22)
According to Vedic civilization, one’s association with women should be very
much restricted. In spiritual life there are four asramas—brahmacarya, grhastha,
vanaprastha and sannyasa. The brahmacari, vanaprastha and sannyasi are com-
pletely forbidden to associate with women. Only grhasthas are allowed to asso-
ciate with women under certain very restricted conditions—that is, one asso-
ciates with women to propagate nice children. Other reasons for association are
condemned.

‘The six divisions of surrender are the acceptance of those things favor-
able to devotional service, the rejection of unfavorable things, the conviction
that Krsna will give protection, the acceptance of the Lord as one’s guardian
or master, full self-surrender and humility.

PURPORT

One who is fully surrendered is qualified with the six following characteristics.
(1) The devotee has to accept everything that is favorable for the rendering of
transcendental loving service to the Lord. (2) He must reject everything unfavora-
ble to the Lord's service. This is also called renunciation. (3) A devotee must be
firmly convinced that Krsna will give him protection. No one else can actually give
one protection, and being firmly convinced of this is called faith. This kind of faith
is different from the faith of an impersonalist who wants to merge into the Brah-
man effulgence in order to benefit by cessation of repeated birth and death. A
devotee wants to remain always in the Lord's service. In this way, Krsna is merciful
to His devotee and gives him all protection from the dangers found on the path of
devotional service. (4) The devotee should accept Krsna as his supreme main-
tainer and master. He should not think that he is being protected by a demigod.
He should depend only on Krsna, considering Him the only protector. The devo-
tee must be firmly convinced that within the three worlds he has no protector or
maintainer other than Krsna. (5) Self-surrender means remembering that one’s ac-
tivities and desires are not independent. The devotee is completely dependent on
Krsna, and he acts and thinks as Krsna desires. (6) The devotee is meek and
humble. As stated in Bhagavad-gita:

sarvasya caham hrdi sannivisto
mattah smrtir jidnam apohanarm ca
vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyo
vedanta-krd veda-vid eva caham

“I am seated in everyone's heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge
and forgetfulness. By all the Vedas am | to be known; indeed | am the compiler of
Vedanta, and | am the knower of the Vedas.” (Bg. 15.15)


--- Page 387 ---
Text 102] The Process of Devotional Service 385
Situated in everyone's heart, Krsna deals differently according to the living en-
tity’s position. The living entity's position is to be under the protection of the il-
lusory energy or under Krsna's personal protection. When a living entity is fully
surrendered, he is under the direct protection of Krsna, and Krsna gives him all in-
telligence by which he can advance in spiritual realization. The nondevotee,
however, being under the protection of the illusory energy, increasingly forgets
his relationship with Krsna. Sometimes it is asked how Krsna causes one to forget.
Krsna causes His devotee to forget material activities, and through the agency of
maya, Krsna causes the nondevotee to forget his devotional service to the Lord.
This is called apohana.

TRANSLATION
“^ ‘When transcendental devotional service by which love for Krsna is at-
tained is executed by the senses, it is called sadhana-bhakti, or the regulative
discharge of devotional service. Such devotion eternally exists within the
heart of every living entity. The awakening of this eternal devotion is the
potentiality of devotional service in practice.”
PURPORT
This verse is found in Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu (1.2.2). Because living entities are
minute, atomic parts and parcels of the Lord, devotional service is already present
within them in a dormant condition. Devotional service begins with sravana
kirtana, hearing and chanting. When a man is sleeping, he can be awakened by
sound vibration; therefore every conditioned soul should be given the chance to
hear the Hare Krsna mantra chanted by a pure Vaisnava. One who hears the Hare
Krsna mantra thus vibrated is awakened to spiritual consciousness, or Krsna con-
sciousness. In this way one’s mind gradually becomes purified, as stated by $i
Caitanya Mahaprabhu (ceto-darpana-marjanam). When the mind is purified, the
senses are also purified. Instead of using the senses for sense gratification, the
awakened devotee employs the senses in the transcendental loving service of the
Lord. This is the process by which dormant love for Krsna is awakened.

TRANSLATION

“Those who have not attained the platform of spontaneous attachment in
devotional service render devotional service under the guidance of a bona
fide spiritual master according to the regulative principles mentioned in the
revealed scriptures. According to the revealed scriptures, this kind of devo-
tional service is called vaidhi bhakti.

PURPORT

In the beginning, one has to hear from a bona fide spiritual master. This is
favorable for advancing in devotional service. According to this process, one
hears, chants, remembers and engages in Deity worship, acting under the direc-
tions of the spiritual master. These are the essential primary activities of devo-
tional service. Devotional service must not be executed for some material pur-
pose. One should not even have a desire to merge into the Absolute Truth. One
has to render such service out of love only. Ahaituki, apratihata. Devotional ser-
vice must be without ulterior motives; then material conditions cannot check it.
Gradually one can rise to the platform of spontaneous loving service. A child is
sent to school by force to receive an education, but when he gets a little taste of
education at an advanced age, he automatically participates and becomes a
learned scholar. One cannot force a person to become a scholar, but sometimes
force is used in the beginning. A child is forced to go to school and read and write
according to the instructions of his teachers. Such is the difference between
vaidhi bhakti and spontaneous bhakti. Dormant love for Krsna exists in every-
one’s heart, and it simply has to be awakened by the regulative process of devo-
tional service. One has to learn to use a typewriter by following the regulative
principles of the typing book. One has to place his fingers on the keys in such a
way and practice, but when one becomes adept, he can type swiftly and cor-
rectly without even looking at the keys. Similarly, one has to follow the rules and
regulations of devotional service as they are set down by the spiritual master;
then one can come to the point of spontaneous loving service. This love is already
there within the heart of everyone (nitya-siddha krsna-prema).


--- Page 393 ---
Text 110] The Process of Devotional Service 391

Spontaneous service is not artificial. One simply has to come to that platform
by rendering devotional service according to the regulative principles. Thus one
has to practice hearing and chanting and follow the other regulative principles by
washing the temple, cleansing oneself, rising early in the morning, attending
marigala-arati and so on. If one does not come to the platform of spontaneous
service in the beginning, he must adopt regulative service according to the in-
structions of the spiritual master. This regulative service is called vaidhi bhakti.

Hare Krsna mantra. Therefore one must strictly chant the Hare Krsna maha-mantra
twenty-four hours daily. One may have other duties to perform under the direc-
tion of the spiritual master, but he must first abide by the spiritual master’s order
to chant a certain number of rounds. In our Krsna consciousness movement, we
have recommended that the neophyte chant at least sixteen rounds. This
chanting of sixteen rounds is absolutely necessary if one wants to remember
Krsna and not forget Him. Of all the regulative principles, the spiritual master's
order to chant at least sixteen rounds is most essential.

One may sell books or enlist life members or render some other service, but
these duties are not ordinary duties. These duties serve as an impetus for remem-
bering Krsna. When one goes with a sarikirtana party or sells books, he naturally
remembers that he is going to sell Krsna's books. In this way, he is remembering
Krsna. When one goes to enlist a life member, he talks about Krsna and thereby
remembers Him. Smartavyah satatarn vispur vismartavyo na jatucit. The conclusion
is that one must act in such a way that he will always remember Krsna, and one
must refrain from doing things that make him forget Krsna. These two principles
form the basic background of Krsna consciousness.

Text 119] The Process of Devotional Service 397
TRANSLATION

“The twelfth item is to give up the company of nondevotees. (13) One
should not accept an unlimited number of disciples. (14) One should not par-
tially study many scriptures just to be able to give references and expand ex-
planations.

PURPORT

Accepting an unlimited number of devotees or disciples is very risky for one
who is not a preacher. According to Srila Jiva Gosvami, a preacher has to accept
many disciples to expand the cult of 7 Caitanya Mahaprabhu. This is risky be-
cause when a spiritual master accepts a disciple, he naturally accepts the disciple’s
sinful activities and their reactions. Unless he is very powerful, he cannot assimi-
late all the sinful reactions of his disciples. Thus if he is not powerful, he has to
suffer the consequences, for one is forbidden to accept many disciples.

One should not partially study a book just to pose oneself as a great scholar by
being able to refer to scriptures. In our Krsna consciousness movement we have
therefore limited our study of Vedic literatures to Bhagavad-gita, Srimad-
Bhagavatam, Caitanya-caritamrta and Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu. These four works
are sufficient for preaching purposes. They are adequate for the understanding of
the philosophy and the spreading of missionary activities all over the world. If one
studies a particular book, he must do so thoroughly. That is the principle. By
thoroughly studying a limited number of books, one can understand the philoso-
phy.

items, another four are added —namely marking tilaka on different parts of the
body, writing the names of the Lord all over the body, accepting the Deity’s gar-
land and accepting caranamrta. These four items are understood to be included
by Kaviraja Gosvami within arcana, worship of the Deity. Although these items are
not mentioned here, they are to be added to the previous thirty-five items. Thus
the total number becomes thirty-nine. To these thirty-nine should be added five
others: association with devotees, chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra, reading
Srimad-Bhagavatam regularly, residing in Mathura, the birthplace of Krsna, and
worshiping the Deity with great respect and veneration. The thirty-nine items plus
these five come to a total of forty-four. If we add the previous twenty items to
these forty-four, the total number becomes sixty-four. The five items mentioned
above repeat previously mentioned items. In the Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu, Srila
Rapa Gosvami states:
anganarn parcakasyasya
parva-vilikhitasya ca
nikhila-sraisthya-bodhaya
punar apy atra sarnsanam

“The glorification of these five items [association with devotees, chanting the
holy name and so on] is to make known the complete superiority of these five
practices of devotional service.”

The sixty-four items of devotional service include all the activities of the body,
mind and senses. Thus the sixty-four items engage one in devotional service in all
respects.

‘One should taste the meaning of Srimad-Bhagavatam in the association

PURPORT
The words sajatiyasaye snigdhe sadhau sangah svato vare are very important
items. One should not associate with professional Bhagavatam reciters. A profes-
sional Bhagavatam reciter is one who is not in the disciplic succession or one who
has no taste for bhakti-yoga. Simply on the strength of grammatical knowledge
and word jugglery, professional reciters maintain their bodies and their desires for
sense gratification by reading Srimad-Bhagavatam. One should also avoid those
who are averse to Lord Visnu and His devotees, those who are Mayavadis, those
who offend the chanting of the Hare Krsna mantra, those who simply dress as
Vaisnavas or so-called gosvamis, and those who make a business by selling Vedic
mantras and reciting Srimad-Bhagavatam to maintain their families. One should
not try to understand Srimad-Bhagavatam from such materialistic people. Ac-
cording to the Vedic injunctions: yasya deve para bhaktih. The Srimad-


--- Page 407 ---

Bhagavatam can only be recited by one who has unflinching faith in the lotus feet
of Krsna and His devotee, the spiritual master. One should try to understand
Srimad-Bhagavatam from the spiritual master. The Vedic injunction states: bhak-
tya bhagavatari grahyarih na buddhya na ca tikaya. One has to understand Srimad-
Bhagavatam through the process of devotional service and by hearing the recita-
tion of a pure devotee. These are the injunctions of Vedic literature—sruti and
smrti. Those who are not in the disciplic succession and who are not pure devo-
tees cannot understand the real mysterious objective of Srimad-Bhagavatam and
Srimad Bhagavad-gita.

Navadvipa-dhama, Jagannatha Puri-dhama and Vindavana-dhama are con-
sidered to be identical. If one goes to Mathura-mandala-bhami for sense gratifica-
tion or to make a livelihood, he commits an offense and is condemned. Whoever
does so must be penalized in the next life by becoming a hog or a monkey in
Vindavana-dhama. After taking on such a body, the offender is liberated in the
next life. Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura remarks that residing in
Vrmdavana with a view to enjoy sense gratification surely leads a so-called devo-
tee to a lower species.

TRANSLATION
“If a person gives up all material desires and completely engages in the
transcendental loving service of Krsna, as enjoined in revealed scriptures, he
is never indebted to demigods, sages or forefathers.
PURPORT
After birth, every man is indebted in so many ways. He is indebted to the
demigods for their supplying necessities like air, light and water. When one takes
advantage of Vedic literatures, one becomes indebted to great sages like
Vyasadeva, Narada, Devala and Asita. When one takes birth in a particular family,
he becomes indebted to his forefathers. We are even indebted to common living
entities like cows, from whom we take milk. Because we accept service from so
many animals, we become indebted. However, if one is completely engaged in
the Lord's devotional service, he is absolved of all debts. This is confirmed in the
following verse, quoted from Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.5.41).

It is said:

“By performing oblations with ghee, the demigods are satisfied. By studying the
Vedas, brahma-yajia is performed, and by this the great sages are satisfied.
Offering libations of water before one’s forefathers is called pitr-yajna. By offering
tribute, bhata-yajia is performed. By properly receiving guests, nr-yajia is per-
formed.” There are five yajias and five kinds of indebtedness —indebtedness to
the demigods, great sages, forefathers, living entities and common men. Therefore
one has to perform five kinds of yajias, but when one takes to sankirtana-yajna
(the chanting of the Hare Krsna mantra) one doesn’t have to perform any other
yajfa. In Srimad-Bhagavatam, Narada Muni made a statement about the

Rsi explained the four incarnations of the four yugas, and at the end, in this verse

solved of all debts.

TRANSLATION

‘’Although the pure devotee does not follow all the regulative principles of
varnasrama, he worships the lotus feet of Krsna. Therefore he naturally has no

PURPORT

The varpasrama institution is planned in such a way that one will not commit
sinful activities. Material existence continues due to sinful activity. When one acts
sinfully in this life, he gets a suitable body for the next life. When one again acts
sinfully, he takes on another material body. In this way one is continuously under
the influence of material nature.

“The living entity in material nature thus follows the ways of life, enjoying the
three modes of material nature. This is due to his association with that material
nature. Thus he meets with good and evil among various species.” (Bg. 13.22)

Due to our association with the modes of material nature, we get different
types of bodies —good and bad. One cannot be liberated from the cycle of birth

and death, known as transmigration of the soul, unless one is completely freed
from all sinful activities. The best process, therefore, is to take to Krsna conscious-
ness. One cannot take to Krsna consciousness without being freed from all sinful
activities. Naturally one who is very serious about Krsna consciousness is freed
from all sinful activity. Consequently a devotee is never inclined to commit sins. If
one is pressured by the law or obligations to give up sinful activity, one cannot do
so. However, if one takes to Krsna consciousness, he can very easily give up all
sinful activity. This is confirmed herein.

advancement in devotional service. Actually this is not a fact. The path of knowl-
edge, mystic yoga and renunciation has nothing to do with the pure soul. When
one is temporarily in the material world, such processes may help a little, but they
are not necessary for a pure devotee of Krsna. In the material world, such activities
end in material enjoyment or merging into the effulgence of the Supreme. They
have nothing to do with the eternal loving service of the Lord. If one abandons
speculative knowledge and simply engages in devotional service, he has attained
his perfection. The devotee has no need for speculative knowledge, pious activity
or mystic yoga. All these are automatically present when one renders the Lord
transcendental loving service.

PURPORT
The path of devotional service is always independent of other activity. The
path of speculative knowledge or mystic yoga may be a little beneficial in the
beginning, but it cannot be considered part of devotional service. This verse
(Srimad-Bhagavatam 11.20.31) was spoken by Lord Krsna when He was speaking
to Uddhava before His departure from this material world. These are important in-
structions given directly by Lord Krsna. $1 Uddhava asked the Lord about the two
kinds of instructions given in the Vedas. One instruction is called pravrtti-marga,


--- Page 418 ---
416 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 22
and the other is called nivrtti-marga. These are directions for enjoying the material
world according to regulative principles and then giving up the material world for
higher spiritual understanding. Sometimes one does not know whether to prac-
tice speculative knowledge or mystic yoga for advancement in spiritual knowl-
edge. Krsna explains to Uddhava that the mechanical process of speculative
knowledge and yoga is not necessary for advancing in devotional service. Devo-
tional service is completely spiritual; it has nothing to do with material things. It is
awakened by hearing and chanting in the association of devotees. Because devo-
tional service is always transcendental, it has nothing to do with material activity.

420 $ri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 22
PURPORT

Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura says that a devotee is attracted by the
service of the inhabitants of Vrndavana—namely the cowherd men, Maharaja
Nanda, mother Yasoda, Radharani, the gopis, and the cows and calves. An ad-
vanced devotee is attracted by the service rendered by an eternal servitor of the
Lord. This attraction is called spontaneous attraction. Technically it is called
svarapa-upalabdhi. This stage is not achieved in the beginning. In the beginning
one has to render service strictly according to the regulative principles set forth by
the revealed scriptures and spiritual master. By continuously rendering service
through the process of vaidhi bhakti, one’s natural inclination is gradually
awakened. That is called spontaneous attraction, or raganuga bhakti.

An advanced devotee situated on the platform of spontaneity is already very
expert in §3stric instruction, logic and argument. When he comes to the point of
eternal love for Krsna, no one can deviate him from that position, neither by argu-
ment nor by $astric evidence. An advanced devotee has realized his eternal rela-
tionship with the Lord, and consequently he does not accept the logic and argu-
ments of others. Such an advanced devotee has nothing to do with the sahajiyas,
who manufacture their own way and commit sins by indulging in illicit sex, intoxi-
cation and gambling, if not meat-eating. Sometimes the sahajiyas imitate ad-
vanced devotees and live in their own whimsical way, avoiding the principles set
down in the revealed scriptures. Unless one follows the six Gosvamis—S$ri Rapa,
Sanatana, Raghunatha Bhatta, Sri Jiva, GCopala Bhatta and Raghunatha dasa—one
cannot be a bona fide spontaneous lover of Krsna. In this connection, Srila Narot-
tama dasa Thakura says: rdpa-raghunatha-pade haibe akuti kabe hama bujhaba
se yugala piriti. The sahajiyas’ understanding of the love affairs between Radha
and Krsna is not bona fide because they do not follow the principles laid down
by the six Gosvamis. Their illicit connection and their imitation of the dress of
Rapa Gosvami as well as their avoidance of the prescribed methods of revealed
scriptures will lead them to the lowest regions of hell. These imitative sahajiyas
are cheated and unfortunate. They are not equal to advanced devotees
(paramaharnsas). Debauchees and paramaharisas are not on the same level.

Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura comments on this verse. Externally a
devotee performs all the items of devotional service—sravana and kirtana—in
nine different ways, and within his mind he always thinks of his eternal relation-
ship with Krsna and follows in the footsteps of the devotees of Vrndavana. If one
engages himself in the service of Radha and Krsna in this way, he can transcend
the regulative principles enjoined in the sastras and, through his spiritual master,
fully engage in rendering spontaneous love to Krsna. In this way, he attains affec-
tion at the lotus feet of Krsna. Krsna actually comes under the control of such
spontaneous feelings, and ultimately one can attain association with the Lord.

The Author

His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada appeared in this world
in 1896 in Calcutta, India. He first met his spiritual master, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta
Sarasvati Gosvami, in Calcutta in 1922. Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati, a prominent
devotional scholar and the founder of sixty-four Gaudiya Mathas (Vedic In-
stitutes), liked this educated young man and convinced him to dedicate his life to
teaching Vedic knowledge. Srila Prabhupada became his student, and eleven
years later (1933) at Allahabad he became his formally initiated disciple.

At their first meeting, in 1922, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura requested
Srila Prabhupada to broadcast Vedic knowledge through the English language. In
the years that followed, 57112 Prabhupada wrote a commentary on the Bhagavad-
gita, assisted the Caudiya Matha in its work and, in 1944, without assistance,
started an English fortnightly magazine, edited it, typed the manuscripts and
checked the galley proofs. He even distributed the individual copies freely and
struggled to maintain the publication. Once begun, the magazine never stopped;
it is now being continued by his disciples in the West.

Recognizing Srila Prabhupada’s philosophical learning and devotion, the
Gaudiya Vaisnava Society honored him in 1947 with the title “Bhaktivedanta.” In
1950, at the age of fifty-four, Srila Prabhupada retired from married life, and four
years later he adopted the vanaprastha (retired) order to devote more time to his
studies and writing. Srila Prabhupada traveled to the holy city of Vrndavana,
where he lived in very humble circumstances in the historic medieval temple of
Radha-Damodara. There he engaged for several years in deep study and writing.
He accepted the renounced order of life (sannyasa) in 1959. At Radha-Damodara,
Srila Prabhupada began work on his life's masterpiece: a multivolume translation
and commentary on the eighteen thousand verse S$rimad-Bhagavatam
(Bhagavata Purana). He also wrote Easy Journey to Other Planets.

After publishing three volumes of Bhagavatam, Srila Prabhupada came to the
United States, in 1965, to fulfill the mission of his spiritual master. Since that time,
His Divine Grace has written over forty volumes of authoritative translations,
commentaries and summary studies of the philosophical and religious classics of
India.

In 1965, when he first arrived by freighter in New York City, Srila Prabhupada
was practically penniless. It was after almost a year of great difficulty that he
established the International Society for Krishna Consciousness in july of 1966.
Under his careful guidance, the Society has grown within a decade to a world-
wide confederation of almost one hundred asramas, schools, temples, institutes
and farm communities.

In 1968, Srila Prabhupada created New Vindavana, an experimental Vedic com-
munity in the hills of West Virginia. Inspired by the success of New Vrndavana,
now a thriving farm community of more than one thousand acres, his students
have since founded several similar communities in the United States and abroad.

In 1972, His Divine Grace introduced the Vedic system of primary and second-
ary education in the West by founding the Curukula school in Dallas, Texas. The
school began with 3 children in 1972, and by the beginning of 1975 the enroll-
ment had grown to 150.

Srila Prabhupada has also inspired the construction of a large international
center at Sridhama Mayapur in West Bengal, India, which is also the site for a
planned Institute of Vedic Studies. A similar project is the magnificent Krsna-
Balarama Temple and International Guest House in Vrndavana, India. These are
centers where Westerners can live to gain firsthand experience of Vedic culture.

Srila Prabhupada’s most significant contribution, however, is his books. Highly
respected by the academic community for their authoritativeness, depth and
clarity, they are used as standard textbooks in numerous college courses. His
writings have been translated into eleven languages. The Bhaktivedanta Book
Trust, established in 1972 exclusively to publish the works of His Divine Grace,
has thus become the world’s largest publisher of books in the field of Indian
religion and philosophy. its latest project is the publishing of Srila Prabhupada’s
most recent work: a seventeen-volume translation and commentary —completed
by $rila Prabhupada in only eighteen months —on the Bengali religious classic $ri
Caitanya-caritamrta.

In the past ten years, in spite of his advanced age, Srila Prabhupada has circled
the globe twelve times on lecture tours that have taken him to six continents. in
spite of such a vigorous schedule, Srila Prabhupada continues to write prolifically.
His writings constitute a veritable library of Vedic philosophy, religion, literature
and culture.

Madhya-lila (the middle period), the
longest of the three, is a detailed narration of
Sri Caitanya’s extensive and eventful travels
throughout India as a renounced mendicant,
teacher, philosopher, spiritual preceptor and
mystic. Finally, Antya-l/ila (the final period)
concerns the last eighteen years of Caitanya
Mahaprabhu’s manifest presence, spent in
semiseclusion in Jagannatha Puri, Orissa.
During these final years, Sri Caitanya drifted
deeper and deeper into trances of spiritual
ecstasy unparalleled in all of religious and

| literary history, Eastern or Western.

Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami, the author of
Sri Caitanya-caritamrta, was a great saint and
a confidential disciple and student of
Raghunatha dasa Gosvami, the renowned
ascetic saint who was one of the most inti-
mate disciples of Sri Caitanya. He com-
menced work on the text while in his late
nineties and in failing health, as he vividly
describes in the text itself: “| have now be-
come too old and disturbed in invalidity.
While writing, my hands tremble. ॥ cannot
remember anything, nor can | see or hear
properly. Still I write, and this is a great
wonder.” That he nevertheless completed,
under such debilitating conditions, the
greatest literary gem of medieval India is
surely one of the wonders of literary history.

The English translation and commentary is
the work of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhakti-
vedanta Swami Prabhupada, the world’s
most distinguished scholar and teacher of
indian religious and philosophical thought.
He himself is a disciplic descendant of Sr
Caitanya, and his intimate familiarity with
the precepts of Caitanya Mahaprabhu emi-
nently qualifies him to present this impor-
tant classic to the English-speaking world.
The ease and clarity with which he ex-
pounds upon Sri Caitanya’s precepts lures
even a reader totally unfamiliar with Indian
religious tradition into a genuine under-
standing and appreciation of this profound
and monumental work.

The entire text, with commentary, pre-
sented in seventeen lavishly illustrated
volumes by the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust,
represents a contribution of major impor-
tance to the intellectual, cultural and
spiritual life of contemporary man.
