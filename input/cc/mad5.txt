Introduction

Sri Caitanya-caritamrta is the principal work on the life and teachings of इग
Krsna Caitanya. Sri Caitanya is the pioneer of a great social and religious move-
ment which began in India a little less than five hundred years ago and which has
directly and indirectly influenced the subsequent course of religious and phi-
losophical thinking not only in India but in the recent West as well.

Caitanya Mahaprabhu is regarded as a figure of great historical significance.
However, our conventional method of historical analysis—that of seeing a man as
a product of his times— fails here. ग Caitanya is a personality who transcends the
limited scope of historical settings.

At a time when, in the West, man was directing his explorative spirit toward
studying the structure of the physical universe and circumnavigating the world in
search of new oceans and continents, 67 Krsna Caitanya, in the East, was in-
augurating and masterminding a revolution directed inward, toward a scientific
understanding of the highest knowledge of man’s spiritual nature.

The chief historical sources for the life of इत Krsna Caitanya are the kadacas (di-
aries) kept by Murari Gupta and Svaripa Damodara Gosvami. Murari Gupta, a
physician and close associate of 5 Caitanya’s, recorded extensive notes on the
first twenty-four years ০1051 Caitanya's life, culminating in his initiation into the
renounced order, sannyasa. The events of the rest of Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s for-
ty-eight years are recorded in the diary of Svariipa Damodora Gosvami, another of
Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s intimate associates.

Sri Caitanya-caritamrta is divided into three sections called 11/35, which literally
means “pastimes” — Adi-lila (the early period), Madhya-lila (the middle period)
and Antya-lila (the final period). The notes of Murari Gupta form the basis of the
Adi-1ila, and Svaripa Damodara’s diary provides the details for the Madhya- and
Antya-lilas.

The first twelve of the seventeen chapters of Adi-lila constitute the preface for
the entire work. By referring to Vedic scriptural evidence, this preface establishes
Sri Caitanya as the avatara (incarnation) of Krsna (God) for the age of Kali—the
current epoch, beginning five thousand years ago and characterized by material-
ism, hypocrisy and dissension. In these descriptions, Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who
is identical with Lord Krsna, descends to liberally grant pure love of God to the
fallen souls of this degraded age by propagating sankirtana—literally,
“congregational glorification of God” —especially by organizing massive public
chanting of the maha-mantra (Great Chant for Deliverance). The esoteric purpose
of Lord Caitanya’s appearance in the world is revealed, his co-avataras and prin-
cipal devotees are described and his teachings are summarized. The remaining
portion of Adi-lila, chapters thirteen through seventeen, briefly recounts his
divine birth and his life until he accepted the renounced order. This includes his
childhood miracles, schooling, marriage and early philosophical confrontations, as
well as his organization of a widespread sarikirtana movement and his civil disobe-
dience against the repression of the Mohammedan government.

का Caitanya-caritamrta

The subject of Madhya-lila, the longest of the three divisions, is a detailed nar-
ration of Lord Caitanya's extensive and eventful travels throughout India as a
renounced mendicant, teacher, philosopher, spiritual preceptor and mystic. Dur-
ing this period of six years, $f Caitanya transmits his teachings to his principal dis-
ciples. He debates and converts many of the most renowned philosophers and
theologians of his time, including Sankarites, Buddhists and Muslims, and incor-
porates their many thousands of followers and disciples into his own burgeoning
numbers. A dramatic account of Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s miraculous activities at
the giant Jagannatha Cart Festival in Orissa is also included in this section.

Antya-lila concerns the last eighteen years of $f Caitanya’s manifest presence,
spent in semiseclusion near the famous Jagannatha temple at Jagannatha Puri in
Orissa. During these final years, ऽ Caitanya drifted deeper and deeper into
trances of spiritual ecstasy unparalleled in all of religious and literary history,
Eastern or Western. $f Caitanya’s perpetual and ever-increasing religious
beatitude, graphically described in the eyewitness accounts of Svaripa Damodara
Gosvam, his constant companion during this period, clearly defy the investigative
and descriptive abilities of modern psychologists and phenomenologists of
religious experience.

The author of this great classic, Krsnadasa Kavirdja Gosvami, born in the year
1507, was a disciple of Raghunatha dasa Cosvami, a confidential follower of
Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Raghunatha dasa, a renowned ascetic saint, heard and
memorized all the activities of Caitanya Mahaprabhu told to him by Svarapa
Damodara. After the passing away of ऽ Caitanya and Svaripa Damodara,
Raghunatha dasa, unable to bear the pain of separation from these objects of his
complete devotion, traveled to Vrndavana, intending to commit suicide by jump-
ing from Govardhana Hill. In Vrndavana, however, he encountered 1২019 Gosvami
and Sanatana Gosvami, the most confidential disciples of Caitanya Mahaprabhu.
They convinced him to give up his plan of suicide and impelled him to reveal to
them the spiritually inspiring events of Lord Caitanya's later life. Krsnadasa Kaviraja
Gosvami was also residing in Vrndavana at this time, and Raghunatha dasa
Gosvami endowed him with a full comprehension of the transcendental life of $ri
Caitanya.

By this time, several biographical works had already been written on the life of
ऽ Caitanya by contemporary and near-contemporary scholars and devotees.
These included Sri Caitanya-carita by Murari Gupta, Caitanya-marigala by Locana
dasa Thakura and Caitanya-bhagavata. This latter text, a work by Vrndavana dasa
Thakura, who was then considered the principal authority on rf Caitanya'’s life,
was highly revered. While composing his important work, Vrndavana dasa, fearing
that it would become too voluminous, avoided elaborately describing many of
the events of 57 Caitanya's life, particulary the later ones. Anxious to hear of these
later pastimes, the devotees of Vrndavana requested Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami,
whom they respected as a great saint, to compose a book to narrate these

Sri Caitanya-caritimrta
episodes in detail. Upon this request, and with the permission and blessings of the
Madana-mohana Deity of Vrndavana, he began compiling $ri Caitanya-caritamta,
which, due to its biographical excellence and thorough exposition of Lord
Caitanya'’s profound philosophy and teachings, is regarded as the most significant
of biographical works on ऽं Caitanya.

He commenced work on the text while in his late nineties and in failing health,
as he vividly describes in the text itself: “I have now become too old and dis-
turbed in invalidity. While writing, my hands tremble. | cannot remember any-
thing, nor can | see or hear properly. Still | write, and this is a great wonder.” That
he nevertheless completed, under such debilitating conditions, the greatest liter-
ary gem of medieval India is surely one of the wonders of literary history.

This English translation and commentary is the work of His Divine Grace A. C.
Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the world’s most distinguished teacher of In-
dian religious and philosophical thought. His commentary is based upon two
Bengali commentaries, one by his teacher Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvam,
the eminent Vedic scholar who predicted, “The time will come when the people
of the world will learn Bengali to read $ri Caitanya-caritamrta,” and the other by
Srila Bhaktisiddhanta's father, Bhaktivinoda Thakura.

His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada is himself a disciplic
descendant of इं Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and he is the first scholar to execute
systematic English translations of the major works of $ri Caitanya’s followers. His
consummate Bengali and Sanskrit scholarship and intimate familiarity with the
precepts of उव Krsna Caitanya are a fitting combination that eminently qualifies
him to present this important classic to the English-speaking world. The ease and
clarity with which he expounds upon difficult philosophical concepts lures even a
reader totally unfamiliar with Indian religious tradition into a genuine understand-
ing and appreciation of this profound and monumental work.

The entire text, with commentary, presented in seventeen lavishly illustrated
volumes by the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, represents a contribution of major im-
portance to the intellectual, cultural and spiritual life of contemporary man.

CHAPTER 12
The Cleansing of the Gundica Temple

In his Amrta-pravaha-bhasya, Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura summarizes this chapter
as follows. The King of Orissa, Maharaja Prataparudra, tried his best to see Lord
Caitanya Mahaprabhu. 51712 Nityananda Prabhu and the other devotees informed
the Lord about the King's desire, but Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu would not agree to
see him. At that time $ri Nityananda Prabhu devised a plan, and He sent a piece of
the Lord's outward garment to the King. The next day, when Ramananda Raya
again entreated $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu to see the King, the Lord, denying the
request, asked Ramananda Raya to bring the King's son before Him. The prince
visited the Lord dressed like a Vaisnava, and this awakened remembrance of
Krsna. Thus $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu delivered the son of Maharaja Prataparudra.

After this, $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu washed the Gundica house before the
Ratha-yatra took place. He then took His bath at Indradyumna and partook of
prasadain the garden nearby. While $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu washed the temple
০0000179103, some Gaudiya Vaisnava washed the lotus feet of the Lord and drank
the water. This incident is very significant, for it awoke within the devotee
ecstatic love. Then again, the son of Advaita Prabhu named Copila fainted during
kirtana, and when he did not come to his senses, 5 Caitanya Mahaprabhu
favored him by awakening him. There was also some humorous talk between
Nityananda Prabhu and Advaita Prabhu during prasada. Advaita Prabhu said that
Nityananda Prabhu was unknown to anyone and that it was not the duty of a
householder brahmana to accept dinner with a person unknown in society. In
answer to this humorous statement, $ri Nityananda Prabhu replied that Advaita
Acarya was a monist and that one could not know how his mind could be turned
by eating with such an impersonal monist. The conversation of these two
prabhus—Nityananda Prabhu and Advaita Prabhu —carried a deep meaning that
only an intelligent man can understand. After all the Vaisnavas finished their
luncheon, Svaripa Damodara and others took their prasada within the room. $ri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu took great pleasure when He saw the Jagannatha Deity
after the Deity’s retirement. At that time He was accompanied by all the devo-
tees, and all of them were very pleased.

Nityananda Prabhu continued, ‘The King has decided to become a mendi-
cant and accept the sign of a mendicant by wearing an ivory earring. He does
not want to enjoy his kingdom without seeing the lotus feet of Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu.”
PURPORT
॥ India there is still a class of professional mendicants who are very much like
the gypsies of Western countries. They know some magical art and mystical pro-
cesses, and their business is to beg from door to door, sometimes pleading and
sometimes threatening. Such mendicants are sometimes called yogis and some-
times kanaphata yogis. The word kanaphata refers to one who has put a hole in
his ear to wear an earring made of ivory. Maharaja Prataparudra was so depressed
by not getting to see Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu that he decided to become such a
yogi. Ordinary men think that a yogi must have an ivory earring in his ear, but this
is not the sign of a real yogi. Maharaja Prataparudra also thought that to become a
mendicant yogi, one must wear such an earring.

softened, but externally He wished to speak some harsh words.

SYNONYMS
toma-sabara—of all of you; iccha—the desire; ei—is; amare lana—taking Me;
rajake —the King; milaha—meet; ihan—here; katakete giya—by going to Kataka.
TRANSLATION
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu said, “1 can understand that you all desire to take
Me to Kataka to see the King.”
PURPORT
ऽ Caitanya Mahaprabhu is naturally the reservoir of all kindness, and as soon as
He heard the statement made by the King, His heart immediately softened. Thus
the Lord was ready to go see the King even at Kataka. He did not even consider
allowing the King to come from Kataka to Jagannatha Puri to see Him. It is signifi-
cant that ऽ Caitanya Mahaprabhu was so kind that He was ready to go see the
King at Kataka. Apparently it was never expected that the King wanted to see the
Lord at His place, but by way of being externally harsh, the Lord indicated that if
all the devotees so desired, He would go to Kataka to see the King.

meet; rajare—the King; damodara—Damodara Pandita; kahe—says; yabe—

TRANSLATION
‘I shall not meet the King at the request of all the devotees, but I shall do so
if Damodara will give his permission.”
PURPORT
From the spiritual point of view, a sannyasi is strictly forbidden to see ma-
terialistic people, especially a king who is always engaged in counting pounds,
shillings and pence. Indeed, the meeting between a sannyasi and a king is always
considered abominable. A sannyasi is always subjected to public criticism, and a
small fault on his part is taken seriously by the public. People actually expect a
sannyasi to preach and not take part in any social or political matters. If a sannyasi
is subject to public criticism, his preaching will not be fruitful. शा Caitanya
Mahaprabhu specifically wanted to avoid such criticism so that His preaching
work would not be hampered. It so happened that while the Lord was talking to
His disciples at that time, the devotee Damodara Pandita was present. This
Damodara Pandita was a very faithful devotee and a staunch lover of Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu. Whenever there was anything that might touch or taint the
character of the Lord, Damodara Pandita would immediately point it out, not even
considering the exalted position of the Lord. It is sometimes said that fools rush in
where angels dare not, and Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu wanted to point out
Damodara Pandita’s foolishness in coming forward to criticize the Lord. Thus the
Lord indirectly hinted that if Damodara Pandita would give Him permission, He
would go to see the King. There was deep meaning in this statement, for it is a
warning that Damodara should not dare criticize the Lord any more, for it was not
befitting his position as a devotee. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu was considered the
guide and spiritual master of all the devotees living with Him. Damodara Pandita
was one of them, and the Lord rendered Damodara Pandita a special favor by
warning him to avoid criticizing Him any further. A devotee or a disciple should
never attempt to criticize the Lord or His representative, the spiritual master.

PURPORT
This refers to the day Lord Sri Krsna and His cowherd boys and flocks of animals
were present on the pasturing grounds near Mathura. At that time the cowherd
boys, being a little hungry, requested food, and Lord Krsna asked them to go to


--- Page 20 ---
Text 34] The Cleansing of the Gundica Temple 17
the brahmanas who were engaged nearby in performing yajia, or sacrifice, and to
get some food from that yajia. Being so ordered by the Lord, all the cowherd boys
went to the brahmanas and asked them for food, but they were denied. After this,
the cowherd boys begged food from the wives of the brahmanas. All these wives
were very much devoted to Lord Krsna in spontaneous love, and as soon as they
heard the request of the cowherd boys and understood that Krsna wanted some
food, they immediately left the place of sacrifice. They were very much chastised
for this by their husbands, and they were ready to give up their lives. It is the
nature of a pure devotee to sacrifice his life for the transcendental loving service
of the Lord.

PURPORT
Sri Nityananda Prabhu was thus very tactfully suggesting that Caitanya
Mahaprabhu give a piece of His old clothing to the King. Even though the King
was not fit to meet the Lord, the King would then be pacified by receiving such a
cloth. The King was very much anxious to see the Lord, yet it was not possible for
the Lord to see him. just to resolve the situation, Nityananda Prabhu suggested
that the Lord send an old piece of clothing. Thus the King would understand that
the Lord was showing mercy to him. The King would then not do anything drastic
like giving up his life or becoming a mendicant.

--- Page 23 ---
20 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 12
TRANSLATION

When the King received the old cloth, he began to worship it exactly as he

would worship the Lord personally.
PURPORT

This is also the conclusion of the Vedic injunctions. Since the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead is the Absolute Truth, everything in relation to Him is also on
the same platform. The King had great affection for $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and
although he did not see the Lord, he had nonetheless already attained the conclu-
sion of devotional service. Immediately upon receiving the cloth from Sar-
vabhauma Bhattacarya, the King began to worship it, accepting it as Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu. The Lord's clothing, bedding, slippers and everything required as an
ordinary necessity are all transformations of Sesa, Visnu, the expansion of Sri
Baladeva. Thus the cloth and other paraphernalia of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead are but other forms of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Everything
connected to the Lord is worshipable. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu instructs us that
just as Krsna is worshipable, Krsna's place, Vrndavana, is also worshipable. And as
Vrndavana is worshipable, similarly the paraphernalia in Vindavana—the trees,
roads, river, everything—is worshipable. A pure devotee thus sings, jaya jaya
vrndavana-vasi yata jana: “All glories to the residents of Vrndavana.” If a devotee
has a staunch devotional attitude, all these conclusions will be awakened or
revealed within the heart.

yasya deve para bhaktir
yatha deve tatha gurau
tasyaite kathita hy arthah
prakdsante mahatmanah
“Only unto those great souls who have implicit faith in both the Lord and the
spiritual master are all the imports of Vedic knowledge automatically revealed.”
($vetasvatara Upanisad, 6.23)

Thus following in the footsteps of Maharaja Prataparudra and other devotees,
we should learn to worship everything belonging to the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. This is referred to by Lord Siva as tadiyanam. In the Padma Purana it is
said:

aradhananarn sarvesam
vispor aradhanarm param

tasmat paratararn devi
tadiyanarm samarcanam


--- Page 24 ---
Text 40] The Cleansing of the Gundica Temple 21
“O Devi, the most exalted system of worship is the worship of Lord Visnu. Greater
than that is the worship of tadiya, or anything belonging to Visnu.” Sri Visnu is
sac-cid-ananda-vigraha. Similarly, the most confidential servant of Krsna, the
spiritual master, and all devotees of Visnu are tadiya. The sac-cid-ananda-vigraha,
guru, Vaisnavas, and things used by them must be considered tadiya and without
adoubt worshipable by all living beings.

TRANSLATION
Sri Ramananda Raya was indeed a diplomatic minister for the King. His
general behavior was very expert, and simply by describing the King’s love for
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, he gradually softened the Lord’s mind.
PURPORT
A diplomat in the material world knows how to deal with people, especially in
political affairs. Some of the great devotees of the Lord —like Ramananda Raya,
Raghunatha dasa Gosvami, Sanatana Gosvami and Rapa Gosvami —were govern-
ment officers and had a background of very opulent householder life. Conse-
quently they knew how to deal with people. In many instances we have seen the
diplomacy of Rapa Gosvami, Raghunatha dasa Gosvami and Ramananda Raya em-
ployed in the service of the Lord. When Raghunatha dasa Gosvami's father and
uncle were to be arrested by government officials, Raghunatha dasa Gosvami hid


--- Page 27 ---
24 $ri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 12
them and personally met the government officers and settled the affair
diplomatically. This is but one instance. Similarly, Sanatana Gosvam, after resign-
ing his ministership, was thrown in jail, and he bribed the attendant of the jail so
he could leave the clutches of the Nawab and live with $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.
Now we see Ramananda Raya, a most confidential devotee of the Lord,
diplomatically soften the heart of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, despite the fact that
the Lord definitely decided not to meet the King. The diplomacy of Ramananda
Raya and entreaties of Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya and all the other great devotees
succeeded. The conclusion is that diplomacy used for the service of the Lord is a
form of devotional service.

vedanusasanam. The Vedas enjoin that one is born as his own son. The son is non-
different from the father, and this is admitted in every revealed scripture. In Chris-
tian theology it is believed that Christ, the son of God, is also God. Both of them
are identical.

TRANSLATION
‘Here is a great devotee,” Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu said. 00001 seeing
him, everyone can remember the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, son
of Maharaja Nanda.”
PURPORT
In his Anubhasya, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura states that a ma-
terialist mistakenly accepts the body and mind as the source of material enjoy-
ment. In other words, a materialist accepts the bodily conception of life. Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu did not regard the son of Maharaja Prataparudra with the
idea that he was a materialist, being the son of a materialist. Nor did He consider
Himself the enjoyer. Mayavadi philosophers make a great mistake by assuming
that the sac-cid-ananda-vigraha, the transcendental form of the Lord, is like a ma-
terial body. However, there is no material contamination in transcendence, nor is
there any possibility of imagining a spirituality in matter. One cannot accept mat-
ter as spirit. As indicated by the technical words bhauma ijya-dhih
(Bhag. 10.84.13), materialistic Mayavadis imagine the form of God in matter, al-
though according to their imagination, God is unlimitedly formless. This is simply
mental speculation. Even though Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead, He placed Himself in the position of a gop. He also accepted
the King's son directly as the son of Maharaja Nanda, Vrajendra-nandana Hari. This
is perfect vision according to the direction of the Vedic culture, as confirmed in
Srimad Bhagavad-gita (panditah sama-darsinah). Such acceptance of the Absolute
Truth according to Vaisnava philosophy is explained in both the Mundaka
Upanisad (3.2.3) and the Katha Upanisad (1.2.23) in the following words:


--- Page 35 ---
32 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 12
ndyam atma pravacanena labhyo
na medhaya na bahuna srutena
yam evaisa vrnute tena labhyas
tasyaisa atma vivrnute tana svam
“The Supreme Lord is not obtained by expert explanations, by vast intelligence,
nor even by much hearing. He is obtained only by one whom He Himself chooses.
To such a person He manifests His own form.”

The living entity is entangled in material existence due to his lack of such
spiritual vision. Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura has sung in his Kalyana-kalpataru: sari-
sare asiya prakrti bhajiya ‘purusa’ abhimane mari. When the living entity comes to
the material world, he thinks himself the enjoyer. Thus he becomes more and
more entangled.

Text 69] The Cleansing of the Gundica Temple 35
SYNONYMS
sei haite—from that day; bhagyavan—the most fortunate; rajara nandana—the
son of the King; prabhu-bhakta-gana-madhye —among the intimate devotees of
the Lord; haili—became; eka-jana—one of them.
TRANSLATION
Since then, the fortunate prince was one of the most intimate devotees of
the Lord.
PURPORT
In this regard, Srila Prabodhananda Sarasvati wrote: yat-kadrunya-kataksa-
vaibhava-vatam. If Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu simply glanced at someone for a
moment, that person immediately turned into one of the most confidential devo-
tees of the Lord. The prince came to see the Lord for the first time, but by the
Lord's mercy the boy immediately became a topmost devotee. This was not in
theory but in practice. We cannot apply the nagna-matrka-nyaya formula. This
states that if one’s mother was naked in her childhood, she should continue to
remain naked, even though she has become a mother of so many children. If a
person is actually benedicted by the mercy of the Lord, he can immediately be-
come a topmost devotee of the Lord. The logic of nagna-matrka states that if a
person is not elevated on such and such a date, he cannot become an exalted
devotee overnight, as it were. This particular instance offers evidence to con-
tradict that theory. On the previous day, the boy was simply an ordinary prince,
and the next day he was counted as one of the topmost devotees of the Lord.
This was all made possible by the causeless mercy of the Lord. The Lord is om-
nipotent, all-powerful and almighty, and He can act as He likes.

At the time of the Ratha-yatra festival, Lord Jagannatha goes to the Gundica
temple from His original temple and stays there for one week. After one week, He
returns to His original temple. It is understood by hearsay that the wife of In-
dradyumna, the King who established the Jagannatha temple, was known as Gun-
dica. There is also mention of the name of the Gundica temple in authoritative
scripture. The area of the Gundica temple is estimated to be 288 cubits by 215
cubits. The main temple inside is about 36 cubits by 30 cubits, and the meeting
18॥ is thirty-two cubits by thirty cubits.

‘I now do not know what My destination is because of this offense. Indeed,

PURPORT

It is significant that Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu told 53108 Damodara Gosvami
that the Bengali Vaisnava was “your Gaudiya Vaisnava.” This means that all
Caudiya Vaisnavas who are followers of the Caitanya cult are subordinate to
Svaripa Damodara Gosvami. The parampara system is very strictly observed by
Gaudiya Vaisnavas. $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s personal secretary was Svaripa
Damodara Gosvami. The next group of devotees was the six Gosvamis, then
Kaviraja Gosvami. It is necessary to observe the parampara system of the Caitanya
cult. There are many offenses one can commit while serving the Lord, and these
are described in the Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu, Hari-bhakti-vilasa and other books.
According to the rules and regulations, no one should accept obeisances in the
temple of the Lord before the Deity. Nor is it proper for a devotee to offer obei-
sances and touch the feet of the spiritual master before the Deity. This is con-
sidered an offense. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu Himself was personally the Supreme


--- Page 64 ---
Text 129] The Cleansing of the Gundica Temple 61
Personality of Godhead; therefore it was not actually offensive to wash His lotus
feet in the temple. However, because He was playing the part of an acarya, the
Lord considered Himself an ordinary human being. He also wanted to give instruc-
tions to ordinary human beings. The point is that even though one plays the part
of a spiritual master, he should not accept obeisances or permit a disciple to wash
his feet before the Deity. This is a matter of etiquette.

PURPORT
In commenting on the cleansing of the Gundica temple, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta
Sarasvati Thakura says that $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu was personally giving in-
structions on how one should receive Lord Krsna, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, within one’s cleansed and pacified heart. If one wants to see Krsna
seated in his heart, he must first cleanse the heart, as prescribed by ऽप Caitanya
Mahaprabhu in His Siksastaka (ceto-darpana-marjanam). In this age, everyone's
heart is unclean, as confirmed in Srimad-Bhagavatam (hrdy antah-stho hy
abhadrani). To wash all dirty things accumulated within the heart, $ri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu advised everyone to chant the Hare Krsna mantra. The first result will
be that the heart is cleansed (ceto-darpana-marjanam). Similarly, Srimad-
Bhagavatam (1.2.17) also confirms this statement:
Srnvatari sva-kathah krspah
punya-sravana-kirtanah
hrdy antah-stho hy abhadrani
vidhunoti suhrt-satam
“51 Krsna, the Personality of Godhead, who is the Paramatma [Supersoull in
everyone's heart and the benefactor of the truthful devotee, cleanses desire for


--- Page 68 ---
Text 135] The Cleansing of the Gundica Temple 65
material enjoyment from the heart of the devotee who relishes His messages,
which are in themselves virtuous when properly heard and chanted.”

If the devotee at all wants to cleanse his heart, he must chant and hear the glo-
ries of the Lord, Sri Krsna (Srnvatan sva-kathah krsnah). This is a simple process.
Krsna Himself will help cleanse the heart because He is already seated there. Krsna
wants to continue living within the heart, and the Lord wants to give directions,
but one has to keep his heart as clean as Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu kept the
Gundica temple. The devotee therefore has to cleanse his heart just as the Lord
cleansed the Gundica temple. In this way one can be pacified and enriched in
devotional service. If the heart is filled with straw, grains of sand, weeds or dust (in
other words, anyabhilasa-ptrpa), one cannot enthrone the Supreme Personality
of Godhead there. The heart must be cleansed of all material motives brought
about through fruitive work, speculative knowledge, the mystic yoga system and
so many other forms of so-called meditation. The heart must be cleansed without
ulterior motive. As Srila Rapa Gosvami says: anyabhilasita-sanyarh jRana-kar-
mady-anavrtam. In other words, there should not be any external motive. One
should not attempt material upliftment, understanding the Supreme by specula-
tive knowledge, fruitive activity, severe austerity and penance, and so on. All
these activities are against the natural growth of spontaneous love of Godhead.
As soon as these are present within the heart, the heart should be understood to
be unclean and therefore unfit to serve as Krsna's sitting place. We cannot per-
ceive the Lord's presence in our hearts unless our hearts are cleansed.

A material desire is explained as a desire to enjoy the material world to its fullest
extent. In modern language, this is called economic development. An inordinate
desire for economic development is considered to be like straws and grains of
sand within the heart. If one is overly engaged in material activity, the heart will
always remain disturbed. As stated by Narottama dasa Thakura:

sarhsara visanale, diva-nisi hiya jvale,
judaite na kainu updya
In other words, endeavor for material opulence is against the principle of devo-
tional service. Material enjoyment includes activities such as great sacrifices for
auspicious activity, charity, austerity, elevation to the higher planetary system,
and even living happily within the material world.

Modernized material benefits are like the dust of material contamination. When
this dust is agitated by the whirlwind of fruitive activity, it overcomes the heart.
Thus the mirror of the heart is covered with dust. There are many desires to per-
form auspicious and inauspicious activities, but people do not know how life after
life they are keeping their hearts unclean. One who cannot give up the desire for
fruitive activity is understood to be covered by the dust of material contamina-
tion. Karmis generally think that the interaction of fruitive activities can be coun-


--- Page 69 ---
66 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 12
teracted by another karma, or fruitive activity. This is certainly a mistaken concep-
tion. If one is deluded by such a conception, he is cheated by his own activity.
Such activities have been compared to an elephant’s bathing. An elephant may
bathe very thoroughly, but as soon as it comes out of the river, it immediately
takes some sand from the land and throws it all over its body. If one suffers due to
his past fruitive activities, he cannot counteract his suffering by performing
auspicious activities. The sufferings of human society cannot be counteracted by
material plans. The only way suffering can be mitigated is by Krsna consciousness.
When one takes to Krsna consciousness and engages himself in the devotional
service of the Lord—beginning with chanting and hearing the glories of the
Lord —the cleansing of the heart begins.

Impersonal speculation, monism (merging into the existence of the Supreme),
speculative knowledge, mystical yoga and meditation are all compared to grains
of sand. They simply cause irritation to the heart. No one can satisfy the Supreme
Personality of Godhead by such activities, nor do we give the Lord a chance to sit
in our hearts peacefully. Rather, the Lord is simply disturbed by them. Sometimes
yogis and jAanis in the beginning take to the chanting of the Hare Krsna maha-
mantra as a way to begin their various practices. However, when they falsely think
that they have attained release from the bondage of material existence, they give
up chanting. They do not consider that the ultimate goal is the form of the Lord or
the name of the Lord. Such unfortunate creatures are never favored by the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, for they do not know what devotional service
is. They are described in Bhagavad-gita in this way:

tan aharn dvisatah kraran
sarhsaresu naradhaman
ksipamy ajasram asubhan
asurisv eva yonisu
“Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, are
cast by Me into the ocean of material existence, into various demoniac species of
life.” (৪8. 16.19)

The demons are always envious of the Lord and are therefore most
mischievous. By His practical example, Sti Caitanya Mahaprabhu has shown us
that all the grains of sand must be picked up thoroughly and thrown outside. $i
Caitanya Mahaprabhu also cleansed the outside of the temple, fearing that the
grains of sand would again come within.

Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura explains that even though one may be-
come free from the desire for fruitive activity, sometimes the subtle desire for frui-
tive activity comes into being within the heart. One often thinks of conducting
business to improve devotional activity. However, the contamination is so strong
that it may later develop into misunderstanding, described as kuti-nati (faultfind-


--- Page 70 ---
Text 135] The Cleansing of the Gundica Temple 67
ing) and pratisthasa (the desire for name and fame and for high position), jiva-him-
sa (envy of other living entities), nisiddhacara (accepting things forbidden in the
sastra), kama (desire for material gain) and paja (hankering for popularity). The
word kuti-nati means duplicity. As an example, one may attempt to imitate Srila
Haridasa Thakura by living in a solitary place. One's real desire may be for name
and fame—in other words, one thinks that fools will accept one to be as good as
Haridasa Thakura just because one lives in a solitary place. These are all material
desires. A neophyte devotee is certain to be attacked by other material desires as
well—women and money. In this way the heart is again filled with dirty things
and becomes harder and harder, like that of a materialist. Gradually one desires to
become a reputed devotee or an avatara (incarnation).

The word jiva-himsa (envy of other living entities) actually means stopping the
preaching of Krsna consciousness. Preaching work is described as paropakara,
welfare activity for others. Those who are ignorant of the benefits of devotional
service must be educated by preaching. If one stops preaching and simply sits
down in a solitary place, he is engaging in material activity. If one desires to make
a compromise with the Mayavadrs, he is also engaged in material activity. A devo-
tee should never make compromises with nondevotees. By acting as a profes-
sional guru, mystic yogi or miracle man, one may cheat and bluff the general
public and gain fame as a wonderful mystic, but all this is considered to be dust,
straw and grains of sand within the heart. In addition, one should follow the
regulative principles and not desire illicit sex, gambling, intoxicants and meat.

To give us practical instructions, Lord जा Caitanya Mahaprabhu cleansed the
temple twice. His second cleansing was more thorough. The idea was to throw
away all the stumbling blocks on the path of devotional service. He cleansed the
temple with firm conviction, as is evident from His using His own personal gar-
ments for cleaning. ऽ Caitanya Mahaprabhu wanted to see personally that the
temple was thoroughly cleansed as clean as marble. Clean marble gives a cooling
effect. Devotional service means attaining peace from all disturbances caused by
material contamination. In other words, it is the process by which the mind is
cooled. The mind can be peaceful and thoroughly cleansed when one no longer
desires anything but devotional service.

Even though all dirty things may be cleansed away, sometimes subtle desires
remain in the mind for impersonalism, monism, success and the four principles of
religious activity (dharma, artha, kama and moksa). All these are like spots on clean
cloth. अ Caitanya Mahaprabhu also wanted to cleanse all these away.

By His practical activity, $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu informed us how to cleanse
our hearts. Once the heart is cleansed, we should invite Lord $ri Krsna to sit down,
and we should observe the festival by distributing prasada and chanting the Hare
Krsna maha-mantra. $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu used to teach every devotee by His
personal behavior. Everyone who spreads the cult of नं Caitanya Mahaprabhu ac-
cepts a similar responsibility. The Lord was personally chastising and praising in-


--- Page 71 ---
68 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 12
dividuals in the course of the cleaning, and those who are engaged as acaryas
must learn from Sr Caitanya Mahaprabhu how to train devotees by personal ex-
ample. The Lord was very pleased with those who could cleanse the temple by
taking out undesirable things accumulated within. This is called anartha-nivrtti,
cleansing the heart of all unwanted things. Thus the cleansing of the Gundica-
mandira was conducted by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu to let us know how the
heart should be cleansed and soothed to receive Lord Sri Krsna and enable Him to
sit within the heart without disturbance.

SYNONYMS
kahan—where; bhattacaryera—of Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya; parva—previous;
jada-vyavahara—material behavior; kahan—where; ei—this; parama-ananda—
transcendental bliss; karaha vicara—just try to consider.
TRANSLATION
After serving Bhatticarya with first-class prasida, Gopinatha Acarya said,
“Just imagine what Bhatticarya’s previous mundane behavior must have
been! Just consider how at present he is enjoying transcendental bliss.”
PURPORT
Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya was previously a smarta-brahmana—that is, one who
strictly follows the Vedic principles on the mundane platform. On the mundane
platform, one cannot believe that prasada is transcendental, that Govinda is the
original form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or that a Vaisnava is a liber-
ated person. These transcendental considerations are out of the ordinary Vedic
scholars jurisdiction. Most scholars are called Vedantists. So-called followers of
Vedanta philosophy consider the Absolute Truth to be impersonal. They also
believe that a person born in a particular caste cannot change his caste until he
dies and takes rebirth. The smarta-brahmanas also reject the fact that maha-
prasada (food offered to the Deity) is transcendental and materially uncontami-
nated. Originally, Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya was subjected to all the rules and


--- Page 91 ---
88 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 12
regulations of the Vedic principles on the mundane platform. Now Gopinatha
Acarya pointed out how Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya had been converted by the
causeless mercy of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Being converted, Sarvabhauma par-
took of prasada with the Vaisnavas. Indeed, he sat by the side of Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu.

PURPORT
As Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura explains, the word bahirmukha refers
to a person who is very busy tasting material enjoyment. Such a person always
poses himself as an enjoyer of the external energy of the Supreme Personality of


--- Page 93 ---
90 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 12
Codhead. Being attracted by external opulence, the nondevotee always forgets
his intimate relationship with Krsna. Such a person does not like the idea of be-
coming Krsna conscious. This is explained by Srila Prahlada Maharaja in Srimad-
Bhagavatam (7.5.30):
matir na krsne paratah svato va
mitho ‘bhipadyeta grha-vratanam
adanta-gobhir visatarn tamisrarh
punah punas carvita-carvananam
Materialists who are overly attracted to the material body, material world and ma-
terial enjoyment, who cannot control their material senses, are carried to the
darkest regions of material existence. Such people cannot become Krsna con-
scious, neither by themselves nor by congregational effort. Such people do not
understand that the goal of life for a human being is to understand the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Visnu. A human life is especially meant for this purpose,
and one has to go through all kinds of penances and austerities and set aside the
propensity for sense gratification. Materialists always remain blind because they
are always guided by blind rascals. A materialistic person considers himself free to
act as he likes. He does not know that he is rigidly controlled by the stringent laws
of nature, nor does he know that he has to transmigrate from one body to another
and perpetually rot in material existence. Such rascals and foolish people are lured
by the prayers of their foolish leaders for sense gratification, and they cannot
understand what is meant by Krsna consciousness. The material world exists out-
side the spiritual sky, and a foolish materialist cannot estimate the extent of this
material sky. What, then, can he know of the spiritual sky? Materialists simply
believe their imperfect senses and do not take instructions from the revealed
scriptures. According to Vedic civilization, one has to see through the authority of
the revealed scriptures. Sastra-caksuh: one should see everything through the
medium of the Vedic literature. In this way, one can distinguish between the
spiritual world and material world. If one ignores such instructions, he cannot be
convinced of the existence of the spiritual world. Because they have forgotten
their spiritual identity, materialists take this material world as the all in all. They are
therefore called bahirmukha.

TRANSLATION

“One who participates in Your impersonal monistic philosophy does not

accept anything but the one Brahman.”
PURPORT

The impersonal monist does not believe that God is the only object of worship
and that the living entities are His eternal servants. According to the monists, God
and the devotee may be separate in the material state, but when they are
spiritually situated, there is no difference between them. This is called advaita-sid-
dhanta, the conclusion of the monists. Monists consider devotional service of the
Lord to be material activity; therefore they consider such devotional activities to
be the same as karma, or fruitive activity. This monistic mistake is a great stum-
bling block on the road to devotional service.

Actually this discussion between Advaita Acarya and Nityananda was a mock
fight to serve as a great instruction for all devotees. Sri Nityananda Prabhu wanted
to point out that Advaita Acarya, a pure devotee, did not agree with the monistic
conclusion. The conclusion of devotional service is:

vadanti tat tattva-vidas
tattvarn yaj jiianam advayam
brahmeti paramatmeti
bhagavan iti sabdyate
“Learned transcendentalists who know the Absolute Truth call this nondual sub-
stance Brahman, Paramatma or Bhagavan.” (Bhag. 1.2.11)

Absolute knowledge consists of Brahman, Paramatma and Bhagavan. This con-
clusion is not the same as that of the monists. Srila Advaita Acarya was given the
title of acarya because He spread the bhakti cult, not the philosophy of monism.
The true conclusion of advaita-siddhanta is not the same as the philosophy of the
monists. Here advaita-siddhanta means advaya-jiidna, or oneness in variety. Ac-
tually Srila Nityananda Prabhu was praising Srila Advaita Acarya through friendly
mock fighting. He was giving the Vaisnava conclusion in terms of the
Bhagavatam’s conclusive words, vadanti tat tattva-vidas. This is also the conclusion
of a mantra in the Chandogya Upanisad, ekam evadvitiyam.

A devotee knows that there is oneness in diversity. The mantras of the sastras
do not support the monistic conclusions of the impersonalists, nor does Vaisnava
philosophy accept impersonalism without variety. Brahman is the greatest, He


--- Page 99 ---
96 $ri Caitanya-caritaimrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 12
who includes everything, and that is oneness. As Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (7.7),
mattah parataram nanyat: there is no one superior to Krsna Himself. He is the
original substance because every category emanates from Him. Thus He is
simultaneously one with and different from all other categories. The Lord is always
engaged in a variety of spiritual activities, but the monist cannot understand
spiritual variety. The conclusion is that although the powerful and the power are
one and the same, within the energy of the powerful there are varieties. In those
varieties there is a difference between one’s personal self, between types of the
same category and between types of different categories. In other words, there is
always variety in the categories, which are understood as knowledge, the knower
and the knowable. Due to the eternal existence of knowledge, the knower and
the knowable, devotees everywhere know about the eternal existence of the
form, name, qualities, pastimes and entourage of the Supreme Personality of God-
head. Devotees never agree with the monist's preaching of oneness. Unless one
adheres to the conceptions of the knower, the knowable and knowledge, there is
no possibility of understanding spiritual variety, nor can one taste the transcen-
dental bliss of spiritual variety.

The philosophy of monism is an adjustment of the Buddhist philosophy of void-
ism. In a mock fight with rf Advaita Acarya, $ri Nityananda Prabhu was refuting
this type of monistic philosophy. Vaisnavas certainly accept Lord $rf Krsna as the
ultimate one, and that which is without Krsna is called maya, or that which has no
existence. External maya is exhibited in two phases — jiva-maya, the living entities,
and guna-maya, the material world. In the material world there is prakrti (material
nature) and pradhana (the ingredients of material nature). However, when one
becomes Krsna conscious, material and spiritual variety do not exist. An advanced
devotee like Prahlada Maharaja sees everything as one—Krsna. As stated in
$rimad-Bhagavatam: krsna-graha-grhitatma na veda jagad idriam (Bhag. 7.4.37).
One who is in full Krsna consciousness does not distinguish between things mate-
rial and spiritual. He takes everything to be related to Krsna and therefore spiritual.
By advaya-jiiana-darsana, Srila Advaita Acarya has glorified pure devotional ser-
vice. Srila Nityananda Prabhu herein sarcastically condemns the philosophy of the
impersonal monists and praises the correct nondual philosophy of Sri Advaita
Prabhu.

PURPORT

Sangat sanjayate kamah (Bg. 2.62). One develops his consciousness according
to society and association. As Srila Nityananda Prabhu admits, a devotee should
be very careful when associating with those who are not devotees. When asked
by a householder devotee what the behavior of a devotee should be, Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu immediately replied:

asat-sarga-tyaga, —ei vaispava-acara
‘stri-sangi’——eka asadhu, ‘krsnabhakta’ ara
(Cc. Madhya 22.87)
A Vaisnava, a devotee, should simply discard intimate association with non-
devotees. In his Upadesamrta, Srila Rapa Gosvami has described the symptoms of
intimate relationships in this way:
dadati pratigrhnati
guhyam akhyati prcchati
bhunkte bhojayate caiva
sad-vidharh priti-laksanam
The words bhunkte bhojayate indicate that one should eat with devotees. One
should carefully avoid eating food offered by nondevotees. Indeed, a devotee
should be very strict in not accepting food from a nondevotee, especially food
prepared in restaurants or hotels or on airplanes. Srila Nityananda Prabhu's
reference in this connection is meant to emphasize that one should avoid eating
with Mayavadis and covert Mayavadis like the sahijiya Vaisnavas, who are ma-
terially affected.

TRANSLATION
The eyes of Lord Jagannatha conquered the beauty of blossoming lotus
flowers, and His neck was as lustrous as a mirror made of sapphires.
PURPORT
Lord ऽ Caitanya Mahaprabhu usually saw Lord Jagannatha from a distance,
standing behind the column of Garuda. However, upon not seeing Lord Jagan-
natha for fifteen days, Caitanya Mahaprabhu felt great separation from Him. In
great anxiety, Caitanya Mahaprabhu crossed the meeting hall and entered the
room where food was offered, just to see the face of Lord Jagannatha. In verse
210, this action is called maryada-larghana, a violation of the regulative principles.
This indicates that one should not come very near a superior. The Deity of the
Lord and the spiritual master should be seen from a distant place. This is called
maryada. Otherwise, as is said, familiarity breeds contempt. Sometimes coming
too near the Deity or the spiritual master degrades the neophyte devotee. Per-


--- Page 109 ---
106 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 12
sonal servants of the Deity and the spiritual master should therefore always be
very careful, for negligence may overcome them in their duty.

Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s eyes have been compared to thirsty
bumblebees, and 1 Jagannatha’s eyes have been compared to blossoming lotus
flowers. The author has made these comparisons in order to describe Lord Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu while the Lord was deeply absorbed in ecstatic love for
Lord Jagannatha.

PURPORT
In the Laghu-bhagavatamrta (1.5.538), Srila Ripa Gosvami has described the
beauty of the Lord in this way:
asamanordhva-madhurya-
tararigamrta-varidhih
jarigama-sthavarollasi-
rapo gopendra-nandanah
“The beauty of the son of Maharaja Nanda is incomparable. Nothing is higher than
His beauty, and nothing can equal it. His beauty is like waves in an ocean of nec-
tar. This beauty is attractive both for moving and for nonmoving objects.”
Similarly, in the Tantra-sastra, there is another description of the Lord's beauty:
kandarpa-koty-arbuda-rapa-sobha-
nirdjya-padabja-nakhar calasya
kutrapy adrsta-sruta-ramya-kanter
dhyanarh parari nanda-sutasya vaksye
“I shall relate the supreme meditation upon Lord $ri Krsna, the son of Nanda
Maharaja. The tips of the toes of His lotus feet reflect the beauty of the bodies of
unlimited millions of Cupids, and His bodily luster has never been seen or heard of
anywhere.” i
One may also consult Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.29.14) in this connection.

CHAPTER 13
The Ecstatic
Dancing of the Lord at Ratha-yatra
A summary of this chapter is given by Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura in his Amrta-pra-
vaha-bhasya as follows. After bathing early in the morning, Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu saw the Deities (Jagannatha, Baladeva and Subhadra) get aboard
Their three carts. This function is called Pandu-vijaya. At that time, King Pra-
taparudra took a broom with a golden handle and began to cleanse the road. Lord
Jagannatha took permission from the goddess of fortune and then started in the
car for the Gundica temple. The road to the temple led along a broad, sandy
beach, and on both sides of the road were residential quarters, houses and gar-
dens. Along that road the servants called gaudas began to pull the cars. Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu divided His sankirtana party into seven divisions. With two
17710317835 in each division, there were altogether fourteen mrdarngas. While per-
forming kirtana, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu exhibited various symptoms of tran-
scendental ecstasy, and Jagannatha and ऽ Caitanya Mahaprabhu exchanged
Their feelings very blissfully. When the cars reached the place known as Balagan-
di, the devotees offered the Deities simple food. At this time, in a nearby garden,
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and His devotees took a brief rest from the dancing.

balistha dayita’ gana—yena matta hati

SYNONYMS
balistha dayita’ gana—very strong dayitds, or carriers of Jagannatha; yena—as
if; matta hati—drunken elephants; jagannatha—of Lord Jagannatha; vijaya—
departure; kardya—cause; kari’—performing; hatahati—hand to hand.
TRANSLATION
The very strongly built dayitas [carriers of the Jagannatha Deity] were as
powerful as drunken elephants. They manually carried Lord Jagannatha from
the throne to the car.
PURPORT
The word dayita refers to one who has received the mercy of the Lord. Lord
Jagannatha has a number of stalwart servants known as dayitas. These servants do
not come from very high-caste families (brahmanas, ksatriyas or vaisyas), but be-
cause they are engaged in the service of the Lord, they have been elevated to a
respected position. Thus they are known as dayitas. These servants of Lord Jagan-
natha take care of the Lord from the day of the Snana-yatra up to the time the
Lord is carried from the throne to the Ratha car. In the Ksetra-mahatmya these
dayitas are said to come from the sabaras, a caste that keeps and sells pigs.
However, among the dayitas there are also many who come from the brahmana
caste. Those dayitas coming from the brahmana families are called dayita-patis, or
leaders of the dayitas. The dayita-patis offer food such as sweetmeats to Lord
Jagannatha during the anavasara, the resting period after Snana-yatra. They also
make the early morning offering of sweetmeats daily. It is said that during the
anavasara Lord Jagannatha suffers from fever and that the dayita-patis offer Him
an infusion of drugs represented by fruit juice. It is said that in the beginning Lord
Jagannatha was worshiped by the sabaras and was known as the Deity Nila
Madhava. Later, when the Deity was established in the temple, the Lord became
known as Jagannatha. Because the Deities were taken from the sabaras, all the
Sabara devotees were elevated to the position of dayitas.

SYNONYMS
mahaprabhu —S$ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu; sukha paila—felt very happy; se-
seva—that kind of service; dekhite—to see; mahaprabhura—of Sri Caitanya

Upon seeing the King engaged in such menial service, Caitanya
Mahaprabhu became very happy. Simply by rendering this service, the King
received the mercy of the Lord.
PURPORT
Unless one receives the mercy of the Lord, he cannot understand the Supreme
Personality of Godhead or engage in His devotional service.
athapi te deva padambuja-dvaya-
prasada-lesanugrhita eva hi

(Bhag. 10.14.29)
Only a devotee who has received a small fraction of the mercy of the Lord can
understand Him. Others may engage in theoretical speculation to understand the
Lord, but they can not know anything about Him. Although Maharaja Pra-
taparudra was very eager to see $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, the Lord refused to see
him. However, when जा Caitanya Mahaprabhu saw the King engaged in menial
service for Lord Jagannatha, He became very happy. Thus the King became elig-
ible to receive ऽ Caitanya Mahaprabhu's mercy. If a devotee accepts Lord Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu as the universal guru and Lord Jagannatha as the Supreme
Personality of Godhead Krsna, he is benefited by the combined mercy of Krsna
and guru. That is stated by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu in His instructions to Rapa
Gosvami. (Cc. Madhya 19.151)

by the mercy of the Lord and the guru. By the Lord's mercy one gets the associa-
tion of a bona fide guru, and by the mercy of the guru, one gets a chance to
render devotional service. Devotional service, the science of bhakti-yoga, carries
one from this material world to the spiritual world.

the Nelson Column in Trafalgar Square.” The Nelson Column is a very impressive
statue of Lord Nelson and can be seen from a good distance. Just as the residents
of एता compared the Ratha-yatra car to Mount Sumeru, the residents of London
considered the car rival to the Nelson Monument.

126 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 13
TRANSLATION

Having taken permission from the goddess of fortune, the Lord came out to
ride on the Ratha car and perform His pastimes for the pleasure of the devo-
tees.

PURPORT

In this connection, 51718 Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura comments that as an
ideal husband, Lord Jagannatha remained fifteen days in a secluded place with His
wife, the supreme goddess of fortune. Nonetheless, the Lord wanted to come out
of seclusion to give happiness to His devotees. The Lord enjoys Himself in two
ways, known as svakiya and parakiya. The Lord's conjugal love in the svakiya-rasa
relates to the regulative principles observed in Dvaraka. There the Lord has many
married queens, but in Vrndavana the conjugal love of the Lord is not with His
married wives but with His girl friends, the gopis. Conjugal love with the gopis is
called parakiya-rasa. Lord Jagannatha leaves the secluded place where He enjoys
the company of the supreme goddess of fortune in svakiya-rasa, and He goes to
Vrndavana where He enjoys the parakiya-rasa. Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura
therefore reminds us that the [0105 pleasure in parakiya-rasa is superior to His
pleasure in svakiya-rasa.

In the material world, parakiya-rasa, or loving affairs with unmarried girl friends,
is a most degraded relationship, but in the spiritual world this type of loving affair
is considered the supreme enjoyment. In the material world everything is but a
reflection of the spiritual world, and that reflection is perverted. We cannot
understand the affairs of the spiritual world on the basis of our experience in the
material world. The Lord's pastimes with the gopis are therefore misunderstood
by mundane scholars and word-wranglers. The parakiya-rasa of the spiritual world
should not be discussed except by one who is very advanced in pure devotional
service. The parakiya-rasa in the spiritual world and that in the material world are
not comparable. The former is like gold, and the latter is like iron. Because the dif-
ference between the two is so great, they cannot actually be compared.
However, one can easily distinguish the value of gold by seeing the value of iron.
One who has the proper realization can easily distinguish the transcendental ac-
tivities of the spiritual world from material activities.

PURPORT
The mystery of the Lord's activities is described by Srila Bhaktisiddhanta
Sarasvatl Thakura. Lord Jagannatha was astonished to see the transcendental
dancing and chanting of आ Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and He stopped His car just to
see the dancing. Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu then danced in such a mystical way
that He pleased Lord Jagannatha. The seer and the dancer were one and the same
Supreme Person, but the Lord, being one and many at the same time, was exhibit-
ing the variegatedness of His pastimes. This is the meaning behind His mysterious
exhibition. By the mercy of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, the King could understand
how both of Them were enjoying each other's activities. Another mysterious ex-
hibition was जं Caitanya Mahaprabhu's simultaneous presence in seven groups.
By the mercy of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, the King could understand that also.

TRANSLATION

Although the King was refused an interview, he was indirectly bestowed
causeless mercy. Who can understand the internal potency of Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu?

PURPORT

As Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu was playing the part of a world teacher, He did not
agree to see the King because a king is a mundane person interested in money
and women. Indeed, the very name “king” suggests one who is always sur-
rounded by money and women. As a sannyasi, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu was
afraid of both money and women. The very word “king is repugnant to one who
is in the renounced order of life. आ Caitanya Mahaprabhu refused to see the King,
but indirectly, by the Lord's causeless mercy, the King was able to understand the
Lord's mysterious activities. Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu's activities were exhibited
sometimes to reveal Him as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and sometimes
to show Him as a devotee. Both kinds of activity are mysterious and appreciated
only by pure devotees.

TRANSLATION

Indeed, the Personality of Godhead forgot Himself in the course of His tran-
scendental pastimes, but His internal potency [lila-sakti], knowing the inten-
tions of the Lord, made all arrangements.

PURPORT
It is stated in the Upanisads:
parasya saktir vividhaiva srayate
svabhaviki jiana-bala-kriya ca
“The Supreme Lord has multi-potencies which act so perfectly that all con-
sciousness, strength and activity are being directed solely by His will.”
(Svetasvatara Upanisad 6.8)

Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu exhibited His mystic power in presenting Himself
simultaneously in each and every sankirtana group. Most people thought that He
was one, but some saw that He was many. The internal devotees could under-
stand that the Lord, although one, was exhibiting Himself as many in the different
sankirtana groups. When ऽ Caitanya Mahaprabhu danced, He forgot Himself and
was simply absorbed in ecstatic bliss. However, His internal potency arranged
everything perfectly. This is the difference between the internal and external
potency. In the material world, the external potency (material energy) can act
only after one endeavors at great length, but when the Supreme Lord desires,
everything is performed automatically by the internal potency. By His will, things
happen so nicely and perfectly that they appear to be carried out automatically.
Sometimes the activities of the internal potency are exhibited in the material


--- Page 148 ---
146 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 13
world. In fact, all the activities of material nature are actually performed by the in-
conceivable energies of the Lord, but so-called scientists and students of material
nature are unable to understand ultimately how things are happening. They
evasively conclude that everything is being done by nature, but they do not know
that behind nature is the potent Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is ex-
plained in Bhagavad-gita:
mayadhyaksena prakrtih
sayate sa-caracaram
hetunanena kaunteya
jagad viparivartate
“This material nature is working under My direction, O son of Kunti, and itis pro-
ducing all moving and unmoving beings. By its rule this manifestation is created
and annihilated again and again.” (Bg. 9.10)

Bhagavatam; tahate—in that connection; pramana—evidence.

TRANSLATION

Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s dancing before the Ratha-yatra car could be
perceived only by pure devotees. Others could not understand. Descriptions
of Lord Krsna's uncommon dancing can be found in the revealed scripture
$rimad-Bhagavatam.

PURPORT

Lord 57 Krsna expanded Himself into many forms while engaged in the rasa-lila
dance, and He also expanded Himself when He married 16,000 wives in Dvaraka.
The same process was adopted by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu when He expanded
Himself into seven forms to dance in each and every group of the sankirtana
party. These expansions were appreciated by pure devotees, including King Pra-
taparudra. Although for reasons of external formality Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu
refused to see King Prataparudra because he was a king, King Prataparudra be-
came one of the Lord's most confidential devotees by the Lord's special mercy
upon Him. The King could see Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu simultaneously present in
all seven groups. As confirmed in Srimad-Bhagavatam, one cannot see the expan-
sions of the transcendental forms of the Lord unless one is a pure devotee of the
Lord.

This song refers to Srimati Radharani’s meeting with Krsna at the holy place of
Kuruksetra, where Lord Sri Krsna and His brother and sister came to visit when
there was a solar eclipse. It is a song of separation from Krsna. When Radharani
met Krsna at Kuruksetra, She remembered His intimate association in Vrndavana,
and She thought, “Now | have gained the Lord of my life. In His absence | was
being burned by the arrow of Cupid, and thus | was withering away. Now | have
My life again.”

PURPORT
After giving up the company of the gopis in Vindavana, ऽ Krsna, the son of
Maharaja Nanda, engaged in His pastimes at Dvaraka. When Krsna went to Kuruk-
setra with His brother and sister and others from Dvaraka, He again met the in-
habitants of Vrndavana. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is radha-bhava-dyuti-suvalita,
that is, Krsna Himself assuming the part of Srimati Radharani in order to under-
stand Krsna. Lord Jagannatha-deva is Krsna, and Sri Krsna Caitanya Mahaprabhu is
Srimati Radharani. Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s leading Lord Jagannatha toward Gun-


--- Page 174 ---
172 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 13
dica temple corresponded to Srimati Radharan's leading Krsna toward Vindavana.
Sri Ksetra, Jagannatha Puri, was taken as the kingdom of Dvaraka, the place where
Krsna enjoys supreme opulence. However, He was being led by ऽ Caitanya
Mahaprabhu to Vrndavana, the simple village where all the inhabitants are filled
with ecstatic love for Krsna. 57 Ksetra is a place of aisvarya-lil, just as Vindavana
is the place of madhurya-/ila. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu'’s following at the rear of
the ratha indicated that Lord Jagannatha, Krsna, was forgetting the inhabitants of
Vrndavana. Although Krsna neglected the inhabitants of Vrndavana, He could not
forget them. Thus in His opulent Ratha-yatra, He was returning to Vrndavana. In
the role of Srimati Radharani, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu was examining whether
the Lord still remembered the inhabitants of Vindavana. When Caitanya
Mahaprabhu fell behind the Ratha car, Jagannatha-deva, Krsna Himself, under-
stood the mind of $rimati Radharant. Therefore, Jagannatha sometimes fell behind
the dancing ऽ Caitanya Mahaprabhu to indicate to Srimati Radharant that He had
not forgotten. Thus Lord Jagannatha would wait on the ratha for their forward
march. In this way Lord Jagannatha agreed that without the ecstasy of Srimatt
Radharani He could not feel satisfied. While Jagannatha was thus waiting, Caura-
sundara, Caitanya Mahaprabhu, in His ecstasy of जाग Radharani, immediately
came forward to Krsna. At such times, Lord Jagannatha would proceed ahead very
slowly. These competitive exchanges were all part of the love affair between
Krsna and Srimati Radharani. In that competition between Lord Caitanya’s ecstasy
for Jagannatha and Jagannatha's ecstasy for Srimati  Radharani, Caitanya
Mahaprabhu emerged successful.

‘The gopis spoke thus: ‘Dear Lord, whose navel is just like a lotus flower,
Your lotus feet are the only shelter for those who have fallen into the deep well
of material existence. Your feet are worshiped and meditated upon by great
mystic yogis and highly learned philosophers. We wish that these lotus feet
may also be awakened within our hearts, although we are only ordinary per-
sons engaged in household affairs.’ ^“
PURPORT
This is a quotation from Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.82.49). The gopis were never
interested in karma-yoga, jiiana-yoga, or dhyana-yoga. They were simply in-
terested in bhakti-yoga. Unless they were forced, they never liked to meditate on


--- Page 183 ---
Text 137] The Lord’s Dancing at Ratha-yatra 181
the lotus feet of the Lord. Rather, they preferred to take the lotus feet of the Lord
and place them on their breasts. Sometimes they regretted that their breasts were
so hard, fearing that Krsna might not be very pleased to keep His soft lotus feet
there. When those lotus feet were pricked by the grains of sand in the Vrndavana
pasturing ground, the gopis were pained and began to cry. The gopis wanted to
keep Krsna at home always, and in this way their minds were absorbed in Krsna
consciousness. Such pure Krsna consciousness can arise only in Vrndavana. Thus
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu began to explain His own mind, which was saturated in
the ecstasy of the gopis.

Speaking in the mood of Srimati Radharani, Caitanya Mahaprabhu said,
^“ ‘For most people, the mind and heart are one, but because My mind is never
separated from Vrndavana, | consider My mind and Vrndavana to be one. My
mind is already Vrndavana, and since You like Vrndavana, will You please

PURPORT
Only when the mind is free from designations can one desire the association of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The mind must have some occupation. If a


--- Page 184 ---
182 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 13
person is to be free of material things, his mind cannot be vacant; there must be
subject matters for thinking, feeling and willing. Unless one’s mind is filled with
thoughts of Krsna, feelings for Krsna and a desire to serve Krsna, the mind will be
filled with material activities. Those who have given up all material activities and
have ceased thinking of them should always retain the ambition to think of Krsna.
Without Krsna, one cannot live, just as a person cannot live without some enjoy-
ment for his mind.

‘My dear Krsna, formerly, when You were staying in Mathura, You sent
Uddhava to teach Me speculative knowledge and mystic yoga. Now You Your-
self are speaking the same thing, but My mind doesn’t accept it. There is no
place in My mind for jidana-yoga or dhyana-yoga. Although You know Me very
well, You are still instructing Me in jiidna-yoga and dhyana-yoga. It is not right
for You to do so.” ^“
PURPORT
The process of mystic yoga, the speculative method for searching out the
Supreme Absolute Truth, does not appeal to one who is always absorbed in
thoughts of Krsna. A devotee is not at all interested in speculative activities. In-
stead of cultivating speculative knowledge or practicing mystic yoga, a devotee
should worship the Deity in the temple and continuously engage in the Lord's ser-
vice. Temple Deity worship is realized by the devotees to be the same as direct
service to the Lord. The Deity is known as arca-vigraha or arca-avatdra, an incarna-
tion of the Supreme Lord in the form of a material manifestation (brass, stone or
wood). Ultimately there is no difference between Krsna manifest in matter or
Krsna manifest in spirit because both are His energies. For Krsna, there is no dis-
tinction between matter and spirit. His manifestation in material form, therefore, is
as good as His original form, sac-cid-ananda-vigraha. A devotee constantly
engaged in Deity worship according to the rules and regulations laid down in the
sastras and given by the spiritual master realizes gradually that he is in direct con-
tact with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus he loses all interest in so-
called meditation, yoga practice and mental speculation.

For a pure devotee, there is no scope for indulgence in mystic yoga practice or the
cultivation of speculative philosophy. It is indeed impossible for a pure devotee to
engage his mind in such unwanted activities. Even if a pure devotee wanted to,
his mind would not allow him to do so. That is a characteristic of a pure devo-
tee—he is transcendental to all fruitive activity, speculative philosophy and
mystic yoga meditation. The gopis therefore expressed themselves as follows.

Srila Prabodhananda Sarasvati has stated (Caitanya-candramrta 5):

For a pure devotee who has realized Krsna consciousness through Sri Caitanya
14373136178, the monistic philosophy by which one becomes one with the
Supreme appears hellish. The mystic yoga practice by which the mind is con-
trolled and the senses subjugated also appears ludicrous to a pure devotee. The
devotee’s mind and senses are already engaged in the transcendental service of


--- Page 188 ---
186 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 13
the Lord. In this way the poisonous effects of sense activities are removed. If one’s
mind is always engaged in the service of the Lord, there is no possibility that one
will think, feel or act materially. Similarly, the fruitive workers’ attempt to attain
heavenly planets is nothing more than phantasmagoria for the devotee. After all,
the heavenly planets are material, and in due course of time they will all be dis-
solved. Devotees do not care for such temporary things. They engage in transcen-
dental devotional activities because they desire elevation to the spiritual world,
where they can live eternally and peacefully and with full knowledge of Krsna. In
Vrndavana, the gopis, cowherd boys and even the calves, cows, trees and water
are fully conscious of Krsna. They are never satisfied with anything but Krsna.

Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu continued: ^“ ‘The gopis are fallen in the great

ocean of separation, and they are being devoured by the timingila fish, which
represent their ambition to serve You. The gopis are to be delivered from the
mouths of these timingila fish, for they are pure devotees. Since they have no
material conception of life, why should they aspire for liberation? The gopis
do not want that liberation desired by yogis and jhanis, for they are already
liberated from the ocean of material existence.

Text 143] The Lord’s Dancing at Ratha-yatra 187
PURPORT

The bodily conception is created by the desire for material enjoyment. This is
called vipada-smrti, which is the opposite of real life. The living entity is eternally
the servant of Krsna, but when he desires to enjoy the material world, he cannot
progress in spiritual life. One can never be happy by advancing materially. This is
also stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (7.5.30): adanta-gobhir visatari tamisram punah
punas carvita-carvapanam. Through the uncontrolled senses, one may advance
one’s hellish condition. He may continue to chew the chewed; that is, repeatedly
accept birth and death. The conditioned souls use the duration of life between
birth and death only to engage in the same hackneyed activities —eating, sleep-
ing, mating and defending. In the lower animal species, we find the same ac-
tivities. Since these activities are repeated, engaging in them is like chewing that
which has already been chewed. If one can give up his ambition to engage in
hackneyed material life and take to Krsna consciousness instead, he will be liber-
ated from the stringent laws of material nature. One does not need to make a
separate attempt to become liberated. If one simply engages in the service of the
Lord, he will be liberated automatically. As Srila Bilvamangala Thakura therefore
says, muktih svayarh mukulitanjali sevate ‘sman: “Liberation stands before me
with folded hands, begging to serve me.”

(ला hearing Srimati Radharani’s statements, Lord Krsna’s love for the in-
habitants of Vrndavana was evoked, and His body and mind became very per-
turbed. After hearing of their love for Him, He immediately thought Himself
to be always indebted to the residents of Vrndavana. Then Krsna began to
pacify Srimati Radharani as follows.

PURPORT
It is said: vrndavanarh parityajya padam ekam na gacchati. In one sense, Krsna,
the original Personality of Godhead (isvarah paramah krsnah sac-cid-ananda-
vigrahah), does not even take one step away from Vrndavana. However, in order
to take care of various duties, Krsna had to leave Vindavana. He had to go to
Mathura to kill Karnsa, and then He was taken by His father to Dvaraka, where He
was busy with state affairs and disturbances created by demons. Krsna was away
from Vrndavana, and He was not at all happy, as He plainly disclosed to Srimati
Radharani. She is the dearmost life and soul of Sri Krsna, and He expressed His
mind to Her as follows.

Text 151] The Lord’s Dancing at Ratha-yatra 193
TRANSLATION

“Sri Krsna continued: ‘All the inhabitants of Vrndavana-dhama—My
mother, father, cowherd boy friends and everything else —are like My life and
soul. And among all the inhabitants of Vrndavana, the gopis are My very life
and soul. Among the gopis, You, Srimati Radharani, are the chief. Therefore
You are the very life of My life.

PURPORT

Srimati Radharani is the center of all Vrndavana's activities. In Vindavana, Krsna
is the instrument of Srimati Radharani; therefore all the inhabitants of Vindavana
still chant “Jaya Radhe.” From Krsna's own statement given herein, it appears that
Radharani is the Queen of Vindavana and that Krsna is simply Her decoration.
Krsna is known as Madana-mohana, the enchanter of Cupid, but SrimatiRadharani
is the enchanter of Krsna. Consequently Srimati Radharani is called Madana-
mohana-mohini, the enchanter of the enchanter of Cupid.

TRANSLATION
‘Our love affair is more powerful because of My good fortune in receiving

PURPORT
Krsna has two kinds of presence —prakata and aprakata, manifest and un-
manifest. Both are identical to the sincere devotee. Even if Krsna is not physically
present, the devotee's absorption in the affairs of Krsna makes Him present. This is
confirmed in Brahma-samhita (5.38):
premanjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena
santah sadaiva hrdayesu vilokayanti
yarh Syamasundaram acintya-guna-svarapari
govindam adi-purusari tam 2/12/7) bhajami
Due to his intense love, the pure devotee always sees Lord Krsna present within
his heart. All glories to Govinda, the primeval Personality of Godhead! When
Krsna is not manifest before the inhabitants of Vrndavana, they are always ab-
sorbed in thoughts of Him. Therefore even though Krsna was living at that time at
Dvaraka, He was simultaneously present before all the inhabitants of Vrndavana.
This was His aprakata presence. Devotees who are always absorbed in thoughts
of Krsna will soon see Krsna face to face without a doubt. Devotees who are al-
ways engaged in Krsna consciousness and are fully absorbed in thoughts of Krsna
certainly return home, back to Godhead. They then see Krsna directly, face to
face, take prasada with Him and enjoy His company. This is confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita: tyaktva deham punar janma naiti mam eti so ‘rjuna (Bg. 4.9).
During his lifetime, a pure devotee is always speaking of Krsna and engaging in
His service, and as soon as he gives up his body, he immediately returns to Goloka
Vrndavana, where Krsna is personally present. He then meets Krsna directly. This

Text 157] The Lord's Dancing at Ratha-yatra 197
is successful human life. This is the meaning of prakateha anibe satvara. The pure
devotee will soon see the personal manifestation of Lord Sri Krsna.

PURPORT
Just as Krsna does not take a step away from Vrndavana, Krsna's devotee also
does not like to leave Vrndavana. However, when he has to tend to Krsna's busi-
ness, he leaves Vrndavana. After finishing his mission, a pure devotee returns
home, back to Vrndavana, back to Godhead. Krsna assured Radharani that after
killing the demons outside Vindavana, He would return. “I am coming back very
soon,” He promised, “as soon as | have killed the few remaining demons.”

SYNONYMS
tathapi—still; apana-gane —to personal associates; karite—to do; savadhana—
warning; bahye—externally; kichu—some; rosa-abhasa—apparent anger; kailda —

TRANSLATION
However, just to warn His personal associates, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, externally expressed feelings of anger.
PURPORT
When Maharaja Prataparudra asked to see the Lord, ऽ Caitanya Mahaprabhu
immediately refused, saying:
niskificanasya bhagavad-bhajanonmukhasya
param (2/7) jigamisor bhava-sagarasya
sandarsanarn visayinam atha yositam ca
ha hanta hanta visa-bhaksanato ‘py asadhu
(Cc. Madhya 11.8)
The word niskificanasya refers to a person who has finished his material activities.
Such a person can begin to execute his activities in Krsna consciousness to cross
over the ocean of nescience. It is very dangerous for such a person to have inti-
mate relationships with mundane people or to become intimately related with
women. This formality is to be observed by anyone who is serious about going
back home, back to Godhead. To teach His personal associates these principles,
ऽ Caitanya Mahaprabhu expressed external anger when touched by the King.
Since the Lord was very satisfied with the humble behavior of the King, He inten-
tionally allowed the King to touch Him, but externally He expressed anger just to
warn His personal associates.

prasanna—very satisfied; mana—the mind; toma—you; laksya kari’—pointing

TRANSLATION
Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya informed the King, ‘The Lord is very satisfied
with you. By pointing you out, He was teaching His personal associates how to
behave with mundane people.”
PURPORT
Although outwardly the King was a mundane man interested in money and
women, internally he was purified by devotional activities. He showed this by
engaging as a street sweeper to please Lord Jagannatha. A person may appear to
be a pounds-and-shillings man interested in money and women, but if he is ac-
tually very meek and humble and surrendered to the Supreme Personality of God-
head, he is not mundane. Such a judgment can be made only by Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu and His very confidential devotees. As a general principle, however,
no devotee should intimately mix with mundane people interested in money and
women.

CHAPTER 14
Performance of the Vrndavana Pastimes
Dressing himself as a Vaisnava, Maharaja Prataparudra entered a garden alone and
began reciting verses from Srimad-Bhagavatam. He then took the opportunity to
massage the lotus feet of the Lord. The Lord, in His ecstatic love for Krsna, im-
mediately embraced the King and thus bestowed mercy upon him. When there
was an offering of prasada in the garden, Lord Caitanya also partook of it. After
this, when Lord Jagannatha's Ratha car stopped moving, King Prataparudra called
for many elephants to pull it, but they were unsuccessful. Seeing this, Lord
Caitanya began to push the car from behind with His head, and the chariot began
moving. Then the devotees began pulling the chariot with ropes. Near the Gun-
dica temple is a place known as Aitota. This place was fixed up for. Sr Caitanya
Mahaprabhu to rest in. When Lord Jagannatha was seated at Sundaracala, Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu saw it as Vindavana. He performed sporting pastimes in
the water of the lake known as Indradyumna. For nine continuous days during
Ratha-yatra, the Lord remained at Jagannatha Puri, and on the fifth day He and
Svariipa Damodara observed the pastimes of Laksmi, the goddess of fortune. Dur-
ing that time, there was much talk about the pastimes of the gopis. When the
ratha was again being drawn and the chanting resumed, Ramananda Vasu of
Kulina-grama and Satyaraja Khan were requested to bring silk ropes every year for
the Ratha-yatra ceremony.

tribute books because people are unfamiliar with the traditional saffron robes of
the devotees. The devotees have therefore inquired whether they can wear Euro-
pean and American dress before the general public. From the instructions given to
King Prataparudra by Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya, we can understand that we may
change our dress in any way to facilitate our service. When our members change
their dress to meet the public or to introduce our books, they are not breaking the
devotional principles. The real principle is to spread this Krsna consciousness
movement, and if one has to change into regular Western dress for this purpose,
there should be no objection.

TRANSLATION

How powerful is the mercy of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu! Without even in-

quiring about the King, the Lord made everything successful.
PURPORT

$ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s mercy is so powerful that it acts automatically. If a
person renders loving service to Krsna, it never goes in vain. It is recorded in a
spiritual account, and in due time it will fructify. This is confirmed by Bhagavad-
gita (2.40). Svalpam apy asya dharmasya trayate mahato bhayat: “In this endeavor
there is no loss or diminution, and a little advancement on this path can protect
one from the most dangerous type of fear.”

Sr Caitanya Mahaprabhu has particularly bestowed upon all fallen souls in this
age the most potent method of devotional service, and whoever takes to it
through the mercy of आ Caitanya Mahaprabhu is immediately elevated to the
transcendental position. Srimad-Bhagavatam recommends: yajfaih sankirtana-
prayair yajanti hi su-medhasah (Bhag. 11.5.32).

A student of Krsna consciousness must receive Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu'’s mer-
cy; then his devotional service will quickly succeed. This was the case with King
Prataparudra. One has to be noticed by ঠা Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and a little ser-
vice with sincere efforts will convince the Lord that one is a proper candidate for
returning home, back to Godhead. Maharaja Prataparudra did not have a chance
to meet आ Caitanya Mahaprabhu, but when the Lord saw that the King was serv-


--- Page 234 ---
232 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 14
ing Lord Jagannatha as a menial sweeper, the Lord's mercy upon the King became
a solid fact. When Maharaja Prataparudra, in the dress of a Vaisnava, was serving
the Lord, the Lord did not even inquire who he was. Rather, He had compassion
upon him and began to embrace him.

Krsnadasa Kavirdja Gosvami wants to point out that nothing could compare to
the Lord's mercy toward Maharaja Prataparudra; therefore he uses the word
dekha (“just see”) and caitanyera krpa-mahabala ("how powerful is the mercy of
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu”). This is also confirmed by Prabodhananda Sarasvati:
yat-karunya-kataksa-vaibhava-vatam (Caitanya-candramrta, 5). Even a little of Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s mercy serves as a great asset for spiritual advancement.
Therefore the Krsna consciousness movement must be spread through the mercy
of Sr Caitanya Mahaprabhu. When Rapa Gosvami experienced the mercy and
magnanimity of Sr Caitanya Mahaprabhu, he said:

namo maha-vadanyaya
krsna-prema-pradaya te
krsnaya krspa-caitanya-
namne gaura-tvise namah
“| offer my respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Lord 57 Krsna Caitanya who is
more magnanimous than any other avatara, even Krsna Himself, because He is
bestowing freely what no one else has ever given—pure love of Krsna.” Srila
Locana dasa Thakura has also sung, parama karuna, pahurn dui jana, nitai-gaura-
candra: "The two brothers Nitai and Caura are so kind that no one can compare
to them.” Similarly, Srila Narottama dasa Thakura has sung:
vrajendra-nandana yei, $aci-suta haila sei,
balarama ha-ila nitai,
dina-hina yata chila, hari-name uddharila,
1313 saksi jagai-madhai

67 Caitanya Mahaprabhu's special mission is the deliverance of all fallen souls in
Kali-yuga. Devotees of Krsna must persistently seek the favor and mercy of Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu to become fit to return home, back to Godhead.

TRANSLATION
The King replied, ‘My Lord, | am the most obedient servant of Your ser-
vants. It is my ambition that You will accept me as the servant of Your ser-
vants.”
PURPORT
The greatest achievement for a devotee is to become a servant of the servants.
Actually no one should desire to become the direct servant of the Lord. That is
not a very good idea. When Prahlada Maharaja was offered a benediction by
Nrsirhhadeva, Prahlada rejected all kinds of material benediction, but he prayed to
become the servant of the servant of the Lord. When Dhruva Maharaja was
offered a benediction by Kuvera, the treasurer of the demigods, Dhruva could
have asked for unlimited material opulence, but he simply asked for the benedic-
tion of becoming the servant of the servants of the Lord. Kholaveca Sridhara was a
very poor man, but when अ Caitanya Mahaprabhu wanted to give him a
benediction, he also prayed to the Lord to be allowed to remain a servant of the
servants of the Lord. The conclusion is that being the servant of the servants of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the highest benediction one can desire.

mercy and strength of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. A pure Vaisnava 15 very happy to
see a person elevated in devotional service. Unfortunately, there are many so-
called Vaisnavas who become envious to see someone actually recognized by ऽं
Caitanya Mahaprabhu. It is a fact that no one can preach Caitanya Mahaprabhu's
message without receiving the special mercy of the Lord. This is known to every
Vaisnava, yet there are some envious people who cannot tolerate the expansion
of this Krsna consciousness movement all over the world. They find fault with a
pure devotee preacher and do not praise him for the excellent service he renders
in fulfilling Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s mission.

His food; ei sukhe—in this happiness; mahaprabhura—of Lord अ Caitanya
Mahaprabhu; judaya—become fully satisfied; nayana—the eyes.

TRANSLATION

Indeed, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu was fully satisfied just to see how Lord

Jagannitha accepted all the food.
PURPORT

Following in the footsteps of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, a Vaisnava should be
fully satisfied simply to see a variety of food offered to the Deity of Jagannatha or
Radha-Krsna. A Vaisnava should not hunger for a variety of food for his own sake;
rather, his satisfaction is in seeing various foods being offered to the Deity. In his
Gurv-astaka, Srila Vidvanatha Cakravarti Thakura writes:

catur-vidha-sri-bhagavat-prasada-
svadv-anna-trptan hari-bhakta-sanghan
krtvaiva trptirh bhajatah sadaiva
vande guroh sri-caranaravindam
“The spiritual master is always offering Krsna four kinds of delicious food
[analyzed as that which is licked, chewed, drunk and sucked]. When the spiritual
master sees that the devotees are satisfied by eating bhagavat-prasada, he is
satisfied. | offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of such a spiritual
master.”

The spiritual master’s duty is to engage his disciples in preparing varieties of
nice food to offer the Deity. After being offered, this food is distributed as prasada
to the devotees. These activities satisfy the spiritual master, although he himself
does not eat or require such a variety of prasada. By seeing to the offering and dis-
tribution of prasada, he himself is encouraged in devotional service.

TRANSLATION

Observing the beggars eating prasada, $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu chanted,

‘Hari bol!” and instructed them to chant the holy name.
PURPORT
In a song, Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura chants:
miche mayadra vase, ydccha bhese’,
khaccha habudubu, bhai
jiva krsna-dasa, € visvasa,
ka'rle ta’ ara duhkha nai

“Everyone is captivated by the waves of the ocean of nescience, but if everyone
would immediately accept Lord Sri Krsna as their eternal master, there would be
no chance of being carried away by the waves of illusion. Then all sufferings
would stop.” Krsna conducts the material world under the three modes of ma-
terial nature, and consequently there are three platforms of life—higher, middle
and lower. On whatever platform one may be situated, one is tossed by the
waves of material nature. Someone may be rich, someone may be middle class,
and someone may be a poor beggar—it doesn’t matter. As long as one is under
the spell of the three modes of material nature, he must continue to experience
these divisions.

Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu therefore advised the beggars to chant “Hari bol!”
while taking prasada. Chanting means accepting one’s self as the eternal servant


--- Page 249 ---
Text 46] Performance of the Vrndavana Pastimes 247
of Krsna. This is the only solution, regardless of social position. Everyone is suffer-
ing under the spell of maya; therefore the best course is to learn how to get out of
the clutches of maya. That is the verdict of Bhagavad-gita (14.26):
marin ca yo ‘vyabhicarepa
bhakti-yogena sevate
sa gunan samatityaitan
brahma-bhayaya kalpate
“One who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any
circumstance, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to
the level of Brahman.”

One can overcome the spell of maya and attain the transcendental platform by
agreeing to engage in the devotional service of the Lord. Devotional service
begins with sravapam kirtanam; therefore Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu advised the
beggars to chant the Hare Krsna maha-mantra for elevation to the transcendental
position. On the transcendental platform, there is no distinction between the rich,
the middle class and the poor.

TRANSLATION

As soon as the beggars chanted the holy name, ‘Hari bol,” they were im-
mediately absorbed in ecstatic love of Godhead. In this way Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu performed wonderful pastimes.

PURPORT

To feel the emotion of ecstatic love of God is to be on the transcendental plat-

form. If one can keep himself in that transcendental position, he will surely return

Accompanied by His devotees, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu then went into the
garden and enjoyed the pastimes of Vrndavana.
PURPORT
Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura has pointed out that this vrndavana-
vihara—the pastimes of Vrndavana—does not refer to Krsna's mixing with the
gopis or the transcendental mellow of parakiya-rasa. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s
vrndavana-lila in the garden of Jagannatha Puri did not involve association with
women or with other people’s wives in the fashion transcendentally dem-
onstrated by 57 Krsna. In His vrndavana-lila, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu conceived
of Himself as the assistant of Srimati Radharani. When Srimati Radharani enjoyed
the company of Krsna, Her maidservants were very pleased. One should not com-
pare Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s vrndavana-vihara in the garden of Jagannatha
with the activities of the gaurariga-nagaris.

Lord Jagannatha has left His wife, the goddess of fortune, and gone to Vindavana,

tune decides to come to see the Lord at Gundica. The coming of the goddess of
fortune to Gundica is celebrated by Hera-paficami. Sometimes this is misspelled as
Hara-paficami in the section known as ativadi. The word herd means “to see” and
refers to the goddess of fortune going to see Lord Jagannatha. The word pafiicami
means “the fifth day” and is used because this takes place on the fifth day of the
moon.

PURPORT
After seeing the impudence of the goddess of fortune, Svaripa Damodara
Gosvami wanted to inform Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu about the superexcellence
of the gopis’ loving affairs. He therefore said, “My Lord, | never experienced any-
thing like the behavior of the goddess of fortune. We sometimes see a beloved
wife becoming proud of her position and then frustrated due to some neglect.
She then gives up caring for her appearance, accepts dirty clothes and morosely
sits on the floor and draws lines with her nails. We have heard of such egoistic
pride in Satyabhama and the gopis of Vrndavana, but what we see in the goddess
of fortune here at Jagannatha Puri is completely different. She becomes very angry
with her husband, and attacks Him with her great opulence.”

PURPORT
Rasabhasa occurs when one’s relationship with Krsna is adulterated. There are
different types of rasabhasa—first-, second- and third-class. The word rasa means
“mellow,” and abhasa means “a shadow.” If one tastes one kind of mellow and
something extra is imposed, that is uparasa. If something is derived from the
original mellow, it is called anurasa. If something is appreciated that is far removed
from the original mellow, it is called aparasa. Uparasa, anurasa and aparasa are,
respectively, first-, second- and third-class rasabhasas. As stated in Bhakti-
rasamrta-sindhu (4.9):
parvam evanusistena vikala rasa-laksana
rasa eva rasabhasa rasa-jnair anukirtitah

^“ ‘Lord Sri Krsna, who is the Absolute Truth, enjoyed His rasa dance every
night during the autumn season. He performed this dance in the moonlight
and with full transcendental mellows. He used poetic words and surrounded
Himself with women who were very much attracted to Him.’
PURPORT
This verse is a quotation from $rimad-Bhagavatam (10.33.26). The gopis are all
transcendental spirit souls. One should never think that the gopis and Krsna have
material bodies. Vindavana-dhama is also a spiritual abode, and there the days
and nights, the trees, flowers, water and everything else are spiritual. There is not
even a trace of material contamination. Krsna, who is the Supreme Brahman and
Supersoul, is not at all interested in anything material. His activities with the gopis
are all spiritual and take place within the spiritual world. They have nothing to do
with the material world. Lord Krsna's lusty desires and all His dealings with the
gopis are on the spiritual platform. One has to be transcendentally realized before
even considering relishing the pastimes of Krsna with the gopis. One who is on
the mundane platform must first purify himself by following the regulative prin-
ciples. Only then can he try to understand Krsna and the gopis. Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu and Svarapa Damodara Gosvami are here taiking about the relation-
ship between Krsna and the gopis: therefore the subject matter is neither mun-


--- Page 300 ---
298 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 14
dane nor erotic. Being a sannyasi, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu was very strict in His
dealings with women. Unless the gopis were on the spiritual platform, Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu would have never even mentioned them to Svariipa
Damodara Gosvami. Therefore these descriptions do not at all pertain to material
activity.

The left wing and right wing of the gopis has been explained by Rapa Gosvami
in Ujjvala-nilamani. The left wing is described in this way:

krara vameti kirtyate
“A gopi who is always eager to be jealously angered, who is very enthusiastic for
that position, who immediately becomes angry when defeated, who is never
under the control of a hero and who always opposes Him is called vama, or a left-
wing & 001.“
Srila Rapa Gosvami describes the right-wing gopis in this way:
asahya mana-nirbandhe
ndyake yukta-vadini
samabhis tena bhedya ca
daksina parikirtita
“A gopi who cannot tolerate womanly anger, who speaks suitable words to the
hero and who 15 satisfied by His sweet words is called a daksing, or a right-wing
2021.“

PURPORT
Whenever $rimati Radharani leaves Her house, She is always well-dressed and
attractive. It is Her womanly nature to attract Sri Krsna's attention, and upon
seeing Her so attractively dressed, Sri Krsna desires to touch Her body. The Lord
then finds some fault in Her and prohibits Her from going to a river crossing and
stops Her from picking flowers. Such are the pastimes between Srimati Radharani
and Sri Krsna. Being a cowherd girl, Srimati Radharani regularly carries a container

306 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 14
of milk and often goes to sell it on the other side of the Yamuna. To cross the river,
She has to pay the boatman, and the spot where the boatman collects his fares is
called the dana-ghati. Lord 67 Krsna stops Her from going, telling Her, “First You
have to pay the fee; then You will be allowed to go.” This pastime is called dana-
keli-lila. Similarly, if Srimati Radharant wants to pick a flower, जा Krsna claims to be
the garden's proprietor and prohibits Her. This pastime is called kila-kiAcita.
Radharani's shyness arises due to Sri Krsna’s prohibitions, and ecstatic loving
bodily symptoms called kila-kificita-bhava are manifest at this time. These
ecstatic symptoms are explained in the following verse, which is from Srila Rapa
Gosvami's Ujjvala-nilamani (Anubhava-prakarana, 44).

The Author

His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada appeared in this world
in 1896 in Calcutta, India. He first met his spiritual master, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta
Sarasvati Gosvami, in Calcutta in 1922. Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati, a prominent
devotional scholar and the founder of sixty-four Gaudiya Mathas (Vedic In-
stitutes), liked this educated young man and convinced him to dedicate his life to
teaching Vedic knowledge. Srila Prabhupada became his student, and eleven
years later (1933) at Allahabad he became his formally initiated disciple.

At their first meeting, in 1922, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura requested
Srila Prabhupada to broadcast Vedic knowledge through the English language. In
the years that followed, Srila Prabhupada wrote a commentary on the Bhagavad-
gita, assisted the Gaudiya Matha in its work and, in 1944, without assistance,
started an English fortnightly magazine, edited it, typed the manuscripts and
checked the galley proofs. He even distributed the individual copies freely and
struggled to maintain the publication. Once begun, the magazine never stopped;
it is now being continued by his disciples in the West.

Recognizing Srila Prabhupada’s philosophical learning and devotion, the
Gaudiya Vaisnava Society honored him in 1947 with the title “Bhaktivedanta.” In
1950, at the age of fifty-four, Srila Prabhupada retired from married life, and four
years later he adopted the vanaprastha (retired) order to devote more time to his
studies and writing. Srila Prabhupada traveled to the holy city of Vindavana,
where he lived in very humble circumstances in the historic medieval temple of
Radha-Damodara. There he engaged for several years in deep study and writing.
He accepted the renounced order of life (sannyasa) in 1959. At Radha-Damodara,
Srila Prabhupada began work on his life’s masterpiece: a multivolume translation
and commentary on the eighteen thousand verse Srimad-Bhagavatam
(Bhagavata Purana). He also wrote Fasy Journey to Other Planets.

After publishing three volumes of Bhagavatam, Srila Prabhupada came to the
United States, in 1965, to fulfill the mission of his spiritual master. Since that time,
His Divine Grace has written over forty volumes of authoritative translations,
commentaries and summary studies of the philosophical and religious classics of
India.

In 1965, when he first arrived by freighter in New York City, Srila Prabhupada
was practically penniless. It was after almost a year of great difficulty that he
established the International Society for Krishna Consciousness in July of 1966.
Under his careful guidance, the Society has grown within a decade to a world-
wide confederation of almost one hundred asramas, schools, temples, institutes
and farm communities.

In 1968, Srila Prabhupada created New Vrndavana, an experimental Vedic com-
munity in the hills of West Virginia. Inspired by the success of New Vrndavana,
now a thriving farm community of more than one thousand acres, his students
have since founded several similar communities in the United States and abroad.

In 1972, His Divine Grace introduced the Vedic system of primary and second-
ary education in the West by founding the Gurukula school in Dallas, Texas. The
school began with 3 children in 1972, and by the beginning of 1975 the enroll-
ment had grown to 150.

Srila Prabhupada has also inspired the construction of a large international
center at Sridhama Mayapur in West Bengal, India, which is also the site for a
planned Institute of Vedic Studies. A similar project is the magnificent Krsna-
Balarama Temple and International Guest House in Vrndavana, India. These are
centers where Westerners can live to gain firsthand experience of Vedic culture.

Srila Prabhupada’s most significant contribution, however, is his books. Highly
respected by the academic community for their authoritativeness, depth and
clarity, they are used as standard textbooks in numerous college courses. His
writings have been translated into eleven languages. The Bhaktivedanta Book
Trust, established in 1972 exclusively to publish the works of His Divine Grace,
has thus become the world’s largest publisher of books in the field of Indian
religion and philosophy. Its latest project is the publishing of Srila Prabhupada’s
most recent work: a seventeen-volume translation and commentary —completed
by Srila Prabhupada in only eighteen months —on the Bengali religious classic Sr
Caitanya-caritamrta.

In the past ten years, in spite of his advanced age, Srila Prabhupada has circled
the globe twelve times on lecture tours that have taken him to six continents. In
spite of such a vigorous schedule, Srila Prabhupada continues to write prolifically.
His writings constitute a veritable library of Vedic philosophy, religion, literature
and culture.

Sri Caitanya’s extensive and eventful travels
throughout India as a renounced mendicant,
teacher, philosopher, spiritual preceptor and
mystic. Finally, Antya-l/ila (the final period)
concerns the last eighteen years of Caitanya
Mahaprabhu’s manifest presence, spent in
semiseclusion in Jagannatha Puri, Orissa.
During these final years, Sri Caitanya drifted
deeper and deeper into trances of spiritual
ecstasy unparalleled in all of religious and
literary history, Eastern or Western.

, Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami, the author of
Sri Caitanya-caritamrta, was a great saint and
a confidential disciple and student of
Raghunatha dasa Gosvami, the renowned
ascetic saint who was one of the most inti-
mate disciples of Sri Caitanya. He com-
menced work on the text while in his late
nineties and in failing health, as he vividly
describes in the text itself: “I have now be-
come too old and disturbed in invalidity.
While writing, my hands tremble. | cannot
remember anything, nor can | see or hear
properly. Still | write, and this is a great
wonder.” That he nevertheless completed,
under such debilitating conditions, the
greatest literary gem of medieval India is
surely one of the wonders of literary history.

The English translation and commentary is
the work of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhakti-
vedanta Swami Prabhupada, the world’s
most distinguished scholar and teacher of
Indian religious and philosophical thought.
He himself is a disciplic descendant of Sri
Caitanya, and his intimate familiarity with
the precepts of Caitanya Mahaprabhu emi-
nently qualifies him to present this impor-
tant classic to the English-speaking world.
The ease and clarity with which he ex-
pounds upon Sri Caitanya’s precepts lures
even a reader totally unfamiliar with Indian
religious tradition into a genuine under-
standing and appreciation of this profound
and monumental work.

The entire text, with commentary, pre-
sented in seventeen lavishly illustrated
volumes by the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust,
represents a contribution of major impor-
tance to the intellectual, cultural and
spiritual life of contemporary man.
