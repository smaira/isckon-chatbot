Introduction

Sri Caitanya-caritamrta is the principal work on the life and teachings of ऽ
Krsna Caitanya. 6 Caitanya is the pioneer of a great social and religious move-
ment which began in India a little less than five hundred years ago and which has
directly and indirectly influenced the subsequent course of religious and phi-
losophical thinking not only in India but in the recent West as well.

Caitanya Mahaprabhu is regarded as a figure of great historical significance.
However, our conventional method of historical analysis —that of seeing a man as
a product of his times —fails here. जा Caitanya is a personality who transcends the
limited scope of historical settings.

At a time when, in the West, man was directing his explorative spirit toward
studying the structure of the physical universe and circumnavigating the world in
search of new oceans and continents, Sr Krsna Caitanya, in the East, was in-
augurating and masterminding a revolution directed inward, toward a scientific
understanding of the highest knowledge of man’s spiritual nature.

The chief historical sources for the life of $ri Krsna Caitanya are the kadacas (di-
aries) kept by Murari Gupta and Svardpa Damodara Gosvami. Murari Gupta, a
physician and close associate of जा Caitanya’s, recorded extensive notes on the
first twenty-four years of ता Caitanya's life, culminating in his initiation into the
renounced order, sannyasa. The events of the rest of Caitanya Mahaprabhu's for-
ty-eight years are recorded in the diary of Svaripa Damodora Gosvami, another of
Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s intimate associates.

$rf Caitanya-caritamrta is divided into three sections called 11135, which literally
means “pastimes” —Adi-lila (the early period), Madhya-lila (the middle period)
and Antya-lila (the final period). The notes of Murari Gupta form the basis of the
Adi-11l4, and Svarapa Damodara’s diary provides the details for the Madhya- and
Antya-lilas.

The first twelve of the seventeen chapters of Adi-lila constitute the preface for
the entire work. By referring to Vedic scriptural evidence, this preface establishes
ऽ Caitanya as the avatara (incarnation) of Krsna (God) for the age of Kali—the
current epoch, beginning five thousand years ago and characterized by material-
ism, hypocrisy and dissension. In these descriptions, Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who
is identical with Lord Krsna, descends to liberally grant pure love of God to the
fallen souls of this degraded age by propagating sankirtana—literally,
“congregational glorification of God” —especially by organizing massive public
chanting of the maha-mantra (Great Chant for Deliverance). The esoteric purpose
of Lord Caitanya’s appearance in the world is revealed, his co-avataras and prin-
cipal devotees are described and his teachings are summarized. The remaining
portion of Adi-lila, chapters thirteen through seventeen, briefly recounts his
divine birth and his life until he accepted the renounced order. This includes his
childhood miracles, schooling, marriage and early philosophical confrontations, as
well as his organization of a widespread sarikirtana movement and his civil disobe-
dience against the repression of the Mohammedan government.

$ri Caitanya-caritamrta

The subject of Madhya-lila, the longest of the three divisions, is a detailed nar-
ration of Lord Caitanya’s extensive and eventful travels throughout India as a
renounced mendicant, teacher, philosopher, spiritual preceptor and mystic. Dur-
ing this period of six years, $r Caitanya transmits his teachings to his principal dis-
ciples. He debates and converts many of the most renowned philosophers and
theologians of his time, including $Sarkarites, Buddhists and Muslims, and incor-
porates their many thousands of followers and disciples into his own burgeoning
numbers. A dramatic account of Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s miraculous activities at
the giant Jagannatha Cart Festival in Orissa is also included in this section.

Antya-lila concerns the last eighteen years of $rf Caitanya’s manifest presence,
spent in semiseclusion near the famous Jagannatha temple at Jagannatha Puri in
Orissa. During these final years, $f Caitanya drifted deeper and deeper into
trances of spiritual ecstasy unparalleled in all of religious and literary history,
Eastern or Western. Sri Caitanya’s perpetual and ever-increasing religious
beatitude, graphically described in the eyewitness accounts of Svaripa Damodara
Gosvami, his constant companion during this period, clearly defy the investigative
and descriptive abilities of modern psychologists and phenomenologists of
religious experience.

The author of this great classic, Krsnadasa Kavirdgja Gosvami, born in the year
1507, was a disciple of Raghunatha dasa Gosvami, a confidential follower of
Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Raghunatha dasa, a renowned ascetic saint, heard and
memorized all the activities of Caitanya Mahaprabhu told to him by Svariipa
Damodara. After the passing away of $ri Caitanya and Svarpa Damodara,
Raghunatha dasa, unable to bear the pain of separation from these objects of his
complete devotion, traveled to Vrndavana, intending to commit suicide by jump-
ing from Govardhana Hill. In Vrndavana, however, he encountered 1২009 Gosvami
and Sanatana Gosvami, the most confidential disciples of Caitanya Mahaprabhu.
They convinced him to give up his plan of suicide and impelled him to reveal to
them the spiritually inspiring events of Lord Caitanya'’s later life. Krsnadasa Kaviraja
Cosvami was also residing in Vrndavana at this time, and Raghunatha dasa
Gosvami endowed him with a full comprehension of the transcendental life of ऽन
Caitanya.

By this time, several biographical works had already been written on the life of
$1 Caitanya by contemporary and near-contemporary scholars and devotees.
These included $/1 Caitanya-carita by Murari Gupta, Caitanya-margala by Locana
dasa Thakura and Caitanya-bhagavata. This latter text, a work by Vrndavana dasa
Thakura, who was then considered the principal authority on $ri Caitanya’s life,
was highly revered. While composing his important work, Vrndavana dasa, fearing
that it would become too voluminous, avoided elaborately describing many of
the events of $ri Caitanya'’s life, particulary the later ones. Anxious to hear of these
later pastimes, the devotees of Vrndavana requested Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami,
whom they respected as a great saint, to compose a book to narrate these

इत Caitanya-caritamrta
episodes in detail. Upon this request, and with the permission and blessings of the
Madana-mohana Deity of Vindavana, he began compiling Sri Caitanya-caritamrta,
which, due to its biographical excellence and thorough exposition of Lord
Caitanya’s profound philosophy and teachings, is regarded as the most significant
of biographical works on 511 Caitanya.

He commenced work on the text while in his late nineties and in failing health,
as he vividly describes in the text itself: “I have now become too old and dis-
turbed in invalidity. While writing, my hands tremble. | cannot remember any-
thing, nor can | see or hear properly. Still | write, and this is a great wonder.” That
he nevertheless completed, under such debilitating conditions, the greatest liter-
ary gem of medieval India is surely one of the wonders of literary history.

This English translation and commentary is the work of His Divine Grace A.C.
Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the world’s most distinguished teacher of In-
dian religious and philosophical thought. His commentary is based upon two
Bengali commentaries, one by his teacher Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami,
the eminent Vedic scholar who predicted, “The time will come when the people
of the world will learn Bengali to read Sri Caitanya-caritamrta,” and the other by
Srila Bhaktisiddhanta's father, Bhaktivinoda Thakura.

His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada is himself a disciplic
descendant of ऽ Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and he is the first scholar to execute
systematic English translations of the major works of Sri Caitanya's followers. His
consummate Bengali and Sanskrit scholarship and intimate familiarity with the
precepts of Sri Krsna Caitanya are a fitting combination that eminently qualifies
him to present this important classic to the English-speaking world. The ease and
clarity with which he expounds upon difficult philosophical concepts lures even a
reader totally unfamiliar with Indian religious tradition into a genuine understand-
ing and appreciation of this profound and monumental work.

The entire text, with commentary, presented in seventeen lavishly illustrated
volumes by the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, represents a contribution of major im-
portance to the intellectual, cultural and spiritual life of contemporary man.

CHAPTER 7
The Lord’s Tour of South India
In his Amrta-pravaha-bhasya, Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura summarizes the Seventh
Chapter as follows. ऽ Caitanya Mahaprabhu accepted the renounced order of
life in the month of Magha (January-February) and went to Jagannatha Puri in the
month of Phalguna (February-March). He saw the Dola-yatra festival during the
month of Phalguna, and in the month of Caitra He liberated Sarvabhauma Bhat-
tacarya. During the month of Vaisakha, He began to tour South India. When He
proposed to travel to South India alone, Sri Nityananda Prabhu gave Him a
brahmana assistant named Krsnadasa. When ऽ Caitanya Mahaprabhu was begin-
ning His tour, Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya gave Him four sets of clothes and re-
quested Him to see Ramananda Raya, who was residing at that time on the bank
of the River Godavari. Along with other devotees, Nityananda Prabhu accom-
panied the Lord to Alalanatha, but there Lord Caitanya left them all behind and
went ahead with the brahmana Krsnadasa. The Lord began chanting the mantra
“krsna krsna krsna krsna krsna krsna krsna he” In whatever village He spent the
night, whenever a person came to see Him in His shelter, the Lord implored him to
preach the Krsna consciousness movement. After teaching the people of one
village, the Lord proceeded to other villages to increase devotees. In this way He
finally reached Karma-sthana. While there, He bestowed His causeless mercy
upon a brahmana called Karma and cured another brahmana, named Vasudeva,
who was suffering from leprosy. After curing this brahmana leper, $f Caitanya
Mahaprabhu received the title Vasudevamrta-prada, meaning “one who
delivered nectar to the leper Vasudeva!

dence on public opinion; kabhu—at any time; nd—not; pari—able; chadite—to

TRANSLATION
11031100313 Pandita and others are more advanced in receiving the mercy of
Lord Krsna; therefore they are independent of public opinion. As such, they
want Me to enjoy sense gratification, even though it be unethical. But since 1
am a poor sannyasi, | cannot abandon the duties of the renounced order, and
therefore 1 follow them strictly.
PURPORT
A brahmacari is supposed to assist a sannyasi; therefore a brahmacari should
not try to instruct a sannydsi. That is the etiquette. Consequently Damodara
should not have advised Caitanya Mahaprabhu of His duty.

--- Page 17 ---
14 Sri Caitanya-caritaimrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 7
SYNONYMS
inha-sabara—of all the devotees; vasa—controlled; prabhu —the Lord; haye—
is; ye ye—whatever; gune—by the qualities; dosa-aropa-chale—on the plea of
attributing faults; kare —does; guna—high qualities; asvadane —tasting.
TRANSLATION
Actually the Lord is controlled by the good qualities of all His devotees. On
the pretense of attributing faults, He tastes all these qualities.
PURPORT
All the accusations made by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu against His beloved
devotees actually showed His great appreciation of their intense love for Him. Yet
He mentioned these faults one after another as if He were offended by their in-
tense affection. The personal associates of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu sometimes
behaved contrary to regulative principles out of intense love for the Lord, and be-
cause of their love ला Caitanya Mahaprabhu Himself sometimes violated the
regulative principles of a sannyasi. In the eyes of the public, such violations are
not good, but ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu was so controlled by His devotees’ love
that He was obliged to break some of the rules. Although accusing them, Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu was indirectly indicating that He was very satisfied with
their behavior in pure love of Godhead. Therefore in verse twenty-seven He men-
tions that His devotees and associates place more importance on love of Krsna
than on social etiquette. There are many instances of devotional service rendered
by previous dcaryas who did not care about social behavior when intensely ab-
sorbed in love for Krsna. Unfortunately, as long as we are within this material
world, we must observe social customs to avoid criticism by the general
populace. This is Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu's desire.

No one can properly describe Lord $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu'’s affection for
His devotees. He always tolerated all kinds of personal unhappiness resulting

could not tolerate the unhappiness felt by His devotees.

of the renounced order of life; kariya—observing.
TRANSLATION
Therefore, to prevent them from accompanying Him and becoming un-

name; gapane—in counting; jala-patra—water pot; bahir-visa—external gar-
ments; vahibe—will carry; kemane—how.


--- Page 21 ---
18 ওলা Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 7
TRANSLATION
‘Since Your two hands will always be engaged in chanting and counting the
holy names, how will You be able to carry the water pot and external gar-
ments?
PURPORT
From this verse it is clear that Caitanya Mahaprabhu was chanting the holy
names a fixed number of times daily. The Gosvamis used to follow in the
footsteps of अ Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and Haridasa Thakura also followed this
principle. Concerning the Gosvamis—S$rila Ripa Gosvami, Srila Sanatana Gosvam,
Srila Raghunatha Bhatta Gosvam, $rila Jiva Gosvami, Srila Gopala Bhatta Gosvami
and 518 Raghunatha dasa Gosvami—Srinivasa Acarya confirms: sarkhya-par-
vaka-nama-gana-natibhih. (Sad-gosvamy-astaka, 6) In addition to other duties,
$11 Caitanya Mahaprabhu introduced the system of chanting the holy name of the
Lord a fixed number of times daily, as confirmed in this verse (tomara dui hasta
baddha nama-ganane). Caitanya Mahaprabhu used to count on His fingers. While
one hand was engaged in chanting, the other hand kept the number of rounds.
This is corroborated in the Caitanya-candramrta and also in Srila Rapa Gosvami's
Stava-mala:
badhnan prema-bhara-prakampita-karo granthin katidorakaih
sankhyatum nija-loka-margala-hare-krsneti namnari japan
(Caitanya-candramrta, 9)
hare krsnety uccaih sphurita-rasano nama-ganana-
krta-granthi-sreni-subhaga-kati-satrojjvala-karah
(Caitanyastaka, 5)
Therefore devotees in the line of इ Caitanya Mahaprabhu must chant at least
sixteen rounds daily, and this is the number prescribed by the International
Society for Krishna Consciousness. Haridasa Thakura daily chanted 300,000
names. Sixteen rounds is about 28,000 names. There is no need to imitate
Haridasa Thakura or the other Gosvamis, but chanting the holy name a fixed num-
ber of times daily is essential for every devotee.

TRANSLATION
Sri Nityananda Prabhu continued: ‘‘Here is a simple brahmana named
Krsnadasa. Please accept him and take him with You. That is My request.
PURPORT
This Krsnadasa, known as Kala Krsnadasa, is not the Kala Krsnadasa mentioned
in the Eleventh Chapter, verse 37, of Adi-lila. The Kala Krsnadasa mentioned in the
Eleventh Chapter is one of the twelve gopalas (cowherd boys) who appeared to
substantiate the pastimes of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu. He is known as a great
devotee of Lord Nityananda Prabhu. The brahmana named Kala Krsnadasa who
went with ऽत Caitanya to South India and later to Bengal is mentioned in the
Madhya-lila, Tenth Chapter, verses 62-74. One should not take these two to be
the same person.

TRANSLATION

‘’Please do not neglect him, thinking he belongs to a $0013 family engaged
in material activities. It is my request that You meet him without fail.”

PURPORT

In the varpasrama-dharma, the sadra is the fourth division in the social status.
Paricaryatmakarn karma sadrasyapi svabhava-jam (Bg. 18.44). Sadras are meant to
engage in the service of the three higher classes—brahmanas, ksatriyas and
vaisyas. ऽ Ramananda Raya belonged to the karana class, which is the equivalent
of the kayastha class in Bengal. This class is regarded all over India as sadra. It is
said that the Bengali kayasthas were originally engaged as servants of brahmanas
who came from North India to Bengal. Later, the clerical class became the
kayasthas in Bengal. Now there are many mixed classes known as kayastha. Some-
times it is said in Bengal that those who cannot claim any particular class belong to
the kdyastha class. Although these kdyasthas or karanas are considered stdras,
they are very intelligent and highly educated. Most of them are professionals such
as lawyers or politicians. Thus in Bengal the kdyasthas are sometimes considered
ksatriyas. In Orissa, however, the kayastha class, which includes the karanas, is
considered in the $00/3 category. Srila Ramananda Raya belonged to this karana
class; therefore he was considered a sadra. He was also the governor of South
India under the regime of Maharaja Prataparudra of Orissa. In other words, Sar-
vabhauma Bhattacarya informed Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu that Ramananda
Raya, although belonging to the sadra class, was a highly responsible government
officer. As far as spiritual advancement is concerned, materialists, politicians and
$adras are generally disqualified. Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya therefore requested
that Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu not neglect Ramananda Raya, who was highly ad-
vanced spiritually although he was born a $0013 and a materialist.

A visayi is one who is attached to family life and is interested only in wife,
children and worldly sense gratification. The senses can be engaged either in
worldly enjoyment or in the service of the Lord. Those who are not engaged in
the service of the Lord and are interested only in material sense gratification are
called visayi. Srila Ramananda Raya was engaged in government service, and he
belonged to the karana class. He was certainly not a sannydsi in saffron cloth, yet
he was in the transcendental position of a paramahamsa householder. Before be-
coming Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s disciple, Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya considered
Ramananda Raya an ordinary visayi because he was a householder engaged in
government service. However, when the Bhattacarya was actually enlightened in
Vaisnava philosophy, he could understand the exalted transcendental position of
6 Ramananda Raya; therefore he referred to him as adhikari. An adhikari is one


--- Page 34 ---
Text 66] The Lord’s Tour of South India 31
who knows the transcendental science of Krsna and is engaged in His service;
therefore all grhastha devotees are designated as dasa adhikari.

TRANSLATION

‘1 could not realize when 1 first spoke with Ramananda Raya that his topics
and endeavors were all transcendentally uncommon. | made fun of him simply
because he was a Vaisnava.”

PURPORT

Anyone who is a not a Vaisnava or unalloyed devotee of the Supreme Lord
must be a materialist. A Vaisnava living according to $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu's
injunctions is certainly not on the materialistic platform. Caitanya means “spiritual
force!” All of ऽ Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s activities were carried out on the plat-
form of spiritual understanding; therefore only those who are on the spiritual plat-
form are able to understand the activities of $i Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Mate-
rialistic persons who cannot are generally known as karmis or jAanis. The jAanis
are mental speculators who simply try to understand what is spirit and what is
soul. Their process is neti neti: “This is not spirit, this is not Brahman.” The jAanis
are a little more advanced than the dull-headed karmis, who are simply interested
in sense gratification. Before becoming a Vaisnava, Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya was
a mental speculator (7/2), and being such, he always cut jokes with Vaisnavas. A
Vaisnava never agrees with the speculative system of the jianis. Both the janis
and karmis depend on direct sense perception for their imperfect knowledge. The
karmis never agree to accept anything not directly perceived, and the jAanis put
forth only hypotheses. However, the Vaisnavas, the unalloyed devotees of the
Lord, do not follow the process of acquiring knowledge by direct sense percep-
tion or mental speculation. Because they are servants of the Supreme Lord, devo-
tees receive knowledge directly from the Supreme Personality of Godhead as He
speaks it in Bhagavad-gita, or sometimes as He imparts it from within as caitya-
guru. As stated in Bhagavad-gita:

tesa satata-yuktanam
bhajatam priti-parvakam
dadami buddhi-yogam tam
yena mam upayanti te


--- Page 36 ---
Text 68] The Lord’s Tour of South India 33
“To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, | give the
understanding by which they can come to Me.” (Bg. 10.10)

The Vedas are considered to have been spoken by the Supreme Lord. They
were first realized by Brahma, who is the first created being within the universe
(tene brahma hrda ya adi-kavaye). Our process is to receive knowledge through
the parampara system, from Krsna to Brahma, to Narada, Vyasa, ri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu and the six Gosvamis. By disciplic succession, Lord Brahma was en-
lightened from within by the original person, Krsna. Our knowledge is fully perfect
due to being handed from master to disciple. A Vaisnava is always engaged in the
transcendental loving service of the Lord, and as such neither karmis nor jianis
can understand the activities of a Vaisnava. It is said, vaispavera kriya-mudra vijie
na bujhaya: even the most learned man depending on direct perception of
knowledge cannot understand the activities of a Vaispava. After being initiated
into Vaisnavism by rf Caitanya Mahaprabhu, Bhattacarya realized what a mistake
he had made in trying to understand Ramananda Raya, who was very learned and
whose endeavors were all directed to rendering transcendental loving service to
the Lord.

TRANSLATION
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu asked the Bhatticarya’s blessings while he was
engaged in the devotional service of Lord Krsna at home. The Lord wished to
return again to Jagannatha Puri by his mercy.
PURPORT
The word kariha asirvade means, “continue to bestow your blessings upon Me!”
Being a sannyasi, Caitanya Mahaprabhu was on the highest platform of respect
and adoration, whereas Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya, as a householder, was on the
second platform. Therefore a sannyasi is supposed to offer blessings to a grhastha.
Now ऽ Caitanya Mahaprabhu by His practical behavior requested the blessings
of a grhastha. This is the special significance of $rf Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s preach-
ing. He gave equal status to everyone, regardless of material considerations. His
movement is thoroughly spiritual. Although apparently a grhastha (householder),
Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya was unlike the so-called karmis interested in sense
gratification. After being initiated by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, the Bhattacarya
was perfectly situated in the spiritual order; therefore it was quite possible for him
to offer blessings even to a sannyasi. He was always engaged in the service of the


--- Page 38 ---
Text 71] The Lord's Tour of South India 35
Lord even at home. In our disciplic line we have the example of a perfect house-
holder paramahamsa— Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura. In his book Saranagati, Bhakti-
vinoda Thakura stated: ye dina grhe, bhajana dekhi’, grhete goloka bhaya
(Saranagati 31.6). Whenever a householder glorifies the Supreme Lord in his
home, his activities are immediately transformed into the activities of Goloka
Vrndavana, spiritual activities taking place in the Goloka Vrndavana planet of
Krsna. Activities exhibited by Krsna Himself at Bhauma Vrndavana, the
Vrndavana-dhama existing on this planet, are not different from His activities on
the planet Coloka Vrndavana. This is proper realization of Vrndavana any-
where. In our Krsna consciousness movement we inaugurated the New
Vrndavana activities wherein devotees are always engaged in the transcendental
loving service of the Lord, and this is not different from Goloka Vrndavana. The
conclusion is that one who acts strictly in the line of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is
competent to offer blessings to sannyasis, even though he be a grhastha house-
holder. Although he is in an exalted position, a sannyasi yet must elevate himself
to the transcendental platform by rendering service to the Lord. By his actual
behavior, Caitanya Mahaprabhu begged the blessings of Sarvabhauma Bhat-
tacarya. He set the example of how one should expect blessings from a Vaisnava,
regardless of his social position.

It was naturally expected that when Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya fainted and fell
to the ground $f Caitanya Mahaprabhu would have taken care of him and waited
for him to regain consciousness, but He did not do so. Rather, Sr Caitanya
Mahaprabhu immediately started on His tour. It is therefore very difficult to under-
stand the activities of a transcendental person. Sometimes they may seem rather
odd, but a transcendental personality remains in his position, unaffected by mate-
rial considerations.

PURPORT
This prediction of इत Nityananda Prabhu is applicable not only in India but also
all over the world. That is now happening by His grace. The members of the Inter-
national Society for Krishna Consciousness are now traveling from one village to
another in the Western countries and are even carrying the Deity with them.
These devotees distribute various literatures all over the world. We hope that
these devotees who are preaching the message of rf Caitanya Mahaprabhu will
very seriously follow strictly in His footsteps. If they follow the rules and regula-
tions and chant sixteen rounds daily, their endeavor to preach the cult of Sr
Caitanya Mahaprabhu will certainly be successful.

these combined potencies upon any man. Being thus endowed with such poten-
cies, one can become an unalloyed devotee of the Lord. Anyone favored by Lord
গা Caitanya Mahaprabhu was empowered with this bhakti-sakti. Thus the Lord's
followers were able to preach Krsna consciousness by divine grace.

TRANSLATION
Lord $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu did not manifest His spiritual potencies at
Navadvipa, but He did manifest them in South India and liberated all the
people there.
PURPORT
At that time there were many smartas (nondevotee followers of Vedic rituals) at
the holy place of Navadvipa, which was also the birthplace of Lord ऽ Caitanya
Mahaprabhu. Followers of the smrti-$astra are called smartas. Most of them are
nondevotees, and their main business is following strictly the brahminical prin-
ciples. However, they are not enlightened in devotional service. In Navadvipa all
the learned scholars are followers of the smrti-sastra, and Lord Caitanya
Mahaprabhu did not attempt to convert them. Therefore the author has remarked
that the spiritual potency Lord $f Caitanya Mahaprabhu did not manifest at
Navadvipa was by His grace manifest in South India. Thus everyone there became
a Vaisnava. By this it is to be understood that people are really interested in
preaching in a favorable situation. If the candidates for conversion are too disturb-
ing, a preacher may not attempt to spread Krsna consciousness amongst them. it
is better to go where the situation is more favorable. This Krsna consciousness
movement was first attempted in India, but the people of India, being absorbed in
political thoughts, did not take to it. They were entranced by the political leaders.
We preferred, therefore, to come to the West, following the order of our spiritual
master, and by the grace of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu this movement is becom-
ing successful.

ei-mata—in this way; yaite yaite—while passing; gela—He went; karma-
sthane —to the place of pilgrimage known as Karma-ksetra; karma dekhi’—seeing
Lord Karma; kaila—offered; tanre—unto Him; stavana—prayers; praname —and

TRANSLATION

When Lord $ri Caitanya Mahiaprabhu came to the holy place known as Kiir-

ma-ksetra, He saw the Deity and offered prayers and obeisances.
PURPORT

This Karma-sthana is a well-known place of pilgrimage. There is a temple there
of Karmadeva. In the Prapannamrta it is said that Lord Jagannatha took ऽग
Ramanujacarya from Jagannatha Puri and one night threw him to Karma-ksetra.
This Karma-ksetra is situated on the line of the southern railway in India. One has
to go to the railway station known as Cika Kola Road. From this station one goes
eight miles to the east to reach the holy place known as Karmacala. Those who
speak the Telugu language consider this holy place very important. This statement
is reported in the government gazette known as (20121109 Manual. There is the
Deity of Karma there, and Srila Ramanujacarya was thrown from Jagannatha Puri
to this place. At that time he thought that the Deity of Karma was Lord S$iva’s
deity; therefore he was fasting there. Later, when he understood that the kdrma-
marti was another form of Lord Visnu, he instituted very gorgeous worship of Lord
Karma. This statement is found in the Prapannamrta (Chapter Thirty-six). This holy
place of Karma-ksetra, or Karma-sthana, was actually reestablished by $ripada
Ramanujacarya under the influence of Lord Jagannatha-deva at Jagannatha Puri.
Later the temple came under the jurisdiction of the king of Vijaya-nagara. The
Deity was worshiped by the Vaisnavas of the Madhvacarya-sampradaya. In the
temple there are some inscriptions said to be written by $rf Narahari Tirtha, who
was in the disciplic succession of Madhvacarya. Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati
Thakura explains those inscriptions as follows: (1) $ri Purusottama Yati appeared
as the instructor of many learned men. He was a very favorite devotee of Lord
Visnu. (2) His preaching was accepted throughout the world with great respect,
and by his power he would liberate many nondevotees with strong reason and
logic. (3) He initiated Ananda Tirtha and converted many foolish men to accept
sannyasa and punished them with his rod. (4) All his writings and words are very
potent. He gave people devotional service to Lord Visnu, and liberation for eleva-
tion to the spiritual world. (5) His instructions in devotional service were able to
elevate any man to the lotus feet of the Lord. (6) Narahari Tirtha was also initiated
by him, and he became the ruler of the Kalinga Province. (7) Narahari Tirtha
fought with the Savaras, who were candilas, or hunters, and thus saved the
temple of Karma. (8) Narahari Tirtha was a very religious and powerful king. (9) He

died in the $aka Era 1203, in the month of Vaiéakha in the fortnight of the moon's
waxing period, on the day of Ekadasi, after the temple was constructed and dedi-
cated to the holy name of Yogananda Nrsimhadeva. The tablet is dated 1281

The brahmana begged Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu, “My dear Lord, kindly
show me favor and let me go with You. 1 can no longer tolerate the waves of
misery caused by materialistic life.”
PURPORT
This statement is applicable for everyone, regardless of how rich or prosperous
one may be. Narottama dasa Thakura has confirmed this statement: sariisara-
visanale, diva-nisi hiya jvale. He states that the materialistic way of life causes a
burning in the heart. One cannot make any provisions for the troublesome life of


--- Page 66 ---
Text 1271 The Lord's Tour of South India 63
the material world. It is a fact that one may be very happy as far as riches are con-
cerned and one may be very opulent in every respect, yet one has to manage the
visayas to meet the demands of the body and of so many family members and
subordinates. One has to take so much trouble to minister to others. Narottama
dasa Thakura therefore prays: visaya chadiya kabe suddha ha’be mana. Thus one
must become freed from the materialistic way of life. One has to merge himself in
the ocean of transcendental bliss. In other words, one cannot relish transcenden-
tal bliss without being freed from the materialistic way of life. It appears that the
brahmana named Karma was materially very happy, for he expressed his family
tradition as janma-kula-dhana. Now, being glorified, he wanted to leave all these
material opulences. He wanted to travel with $rf Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Accord-
ing to the Vedic way of civilization, one should leave his family after attaining fifty
years of age and go to the forest of Vrndavana to devote the rest of his life to the
service of the Lord.

TRANSLATION

$ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu replied, ‘Don’t speak like that again. Better to

remain at home and chant the holy name of Krsna always.
PURPORT

It is not advisable in this age of Kali to leave one’s family suddenly, for people
are not trained as proper brahmacaris and grhasthas. Therefore ঠা Caitanya
Mahaprabhu advised the brahmana not to be too eager to give up family life. It
would be better to remain with his family and try to become purified by chanting
the Hare Krsna maha-mantra regularly under the direction of a spiritual master.
This is the instruction of rf Caitanya Mahaprabhu. If this principle is followed by


--- Page 67 ---
64 $ri Caitanya-caritaimrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 7
everyone, there is no need to accept sannydsa. In the next verse Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu advises everyone to become an ideal householder by offenselessly
chanting the Hare Krsna mantra and teaching the same principle to everyone he
meets.

TRANSLATION
“Instruct everyone to follow the orders of Lord $ri Krsna as they are given in
Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam. In this way become a spiritual master
and try to liberate everyone in this land.’
PURPORT
This is the sublime mission of the International Society for Krishna Conscious-
ness. Many people come and inquire whether they have to give up family life to
join the Society, but that is not our mission. One can remain comfortably in his
residence. We simply request everyone to chant the maha-mantra: Hare Krsna,
Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare
Hare. If one is a little literate and can read Bhagavad-gita As It Is and $rimad-
Bhagavatam, that is so much the better. These works are now available in an
English translation and are done very authoritatively to appeal to all classes of
men. Instead of living engrossed in material activities, people throughout the
world should take advantage of this movement and chant the Hare Krsna maha-
mantra at home with their families. One should also refrain from sinful activities —
illicit sex, meat-eating, gambling and intoxication. Out of these four items, illicit
sex is very sinful. Every person must get married. Every woman especially must get
married. If the women outnumber the men, some men can accept more than one
wife. In that way there will be no prostitution in society. If men can marry more


--- Page 68 ---
Text 129] The Lord’s Tour of South India 65
than one wife, illicit sex life will be stopped. One can also produce many nice
preparations to offer Krsna—grain, fruit, flowers and milk. Why should one in-
dulge in unnecessary meat-eating and maintain horrible slaughterhouses? What is
the use of smoking and drinking tea and coffee? People are already intoxicated by
material enjoyment, and if they indulge in further intoxication, what chance is
there for self-realization? Similarly, one should not partake in gambling and unnec-
essarily agitate the mind. The real purpose of human life is to attain the spiritual
platform and return to Godhead. That is the summum bonum of spiritual realiza-
tion. The Krsna consciousness movement is trying to elevate human society to
the perfection of life by pursuing the method described by $ri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu in His advice to the brahmana Karma. That is, one should stay at
home, chant the Hare Krsna mantra and preach the instructions of Krsna as they
are given in Bhagavad-gita and $rimad-Bhagavatam.

TRANSLATION
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu further advised the braihmana Karma, “If you
follow this instruction, your materialistic life at home will not obstruct your
spiritual advancement. Indeed, if you follow these regulative principles, we
will again meet here, or, rather, you will never lose My company.”
PURPORT
This is an opportunity for everyone. If one simply follows the instructions of Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu, under the guidance of His representative, and chants the
Hare Krsna mantra, teaching everyone as far as possible the same principle, the
contamination of the materialistic way of life will not even touch him. It does not
matter whether one lives in a holy place like Vrndavana, Navadvipa or Jagannatha
Puri or in the midst of European cities where the materialistic way of life is very
prominent. If a devotee follows the instructions of जा Caitanya Mahaprabhu, he


--- Page 69 ---
66 $ri Caitanya-caritimrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 7
lives in the company of the Lord. Wherever he lives, he converts that place into
Vrndavana and Navadvipa. This means that materialism cannot touch him. This is
the secret of success for one advancing in Krsna consciousness.

TRANSLATION

At whosoever’s house $ri Caitanya accepted His alms by taking prasida, He
would convert the dwellers to His sankirtana movement and advise them just
as He advised the braihmana named Kiirma.

PURPORT

The cult of ऽ Caitanya Mahaprabhu is explained here very nicely. One who
surrenders to Him and is ready to follow Him with heart and soul does not need to
change his location. Nor is it necessary for one to change status. One may remain
a householder, a medical practitioner, an engineer or whatever. It doesn’t matter.
One only has to follow the instruction of अन Caitanya Mahaprabhu, chant the
Hare Krsna maha-mantra and instruct relatives and friends in the teachings of
Bhagavad-gitd and Srimad-Bhagavatam. One has to learn humility and meekness
at home, following the instructions of आ Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and in that way
one’s life will be spiritually successful. One should not try to be an artificially ad-
vanced devotee, thinking, “I am a first-class devotee.” Such thinking should be
avoided. It is best not to accept any disciples. One has to become purified at
home by chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra and preaching the principles
enunciated by ऽ Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Thus one can become a spiritual master
and be freed from the contamination of material life.

There are many sahajiyas who decry the activities of the six Gosvamis —S$rila
Rapa, Sanatana, Raghunatha dasa, Bhatta Raghunatha, Jiva and Gopala Bhatta
Gosvamis—who are the personal associates of जा Caitanya Mahaprabhu and who
enlightened society by writing books on devotional service. Similarly, Narottama
dasa Thakura and other great acdryas like Madhvacarya, Ramanujacarya and


--- Page 70 ---
Text 133] The Lord's Tour of South India 67
others accepted many thousands of disciples to induce them to render devotional
service. However, there is a class of sahajiyds who think that these activities are
opposed to the principles of devotional service. Indeed, they consider such ac-
tivities simply another phase of materialism. Thus opposing the principles of ऽन
Caitanya Mahaprabhu, they commit offenses at His lotus feet. They should better
consider His instructions and, instead of seeking to be considered humble and
meek, should refrain from criticizing the followers of $f Caitanya Mahaprabhu
who engage in preaching. To protect His preachers, आ Caitanya Mahaprabhu has
given much clear advice in these verses of Caitanya-caritamrta.

Mahaprabhu cured him. The only return the Lord wanted was that Vasudeva
preach the instructions of Krsna and liberate all human beings. That is the process
of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. Each and every member of
this Society was rescued from a very abominable condition, but now they are
engaged in preaching the cult of Krsna consciousness. They are not only cured of
the disease called materialism but are also living a very happy life. Everyone ac-
cepts them as great devotees of Krsna, and their qualities are manifest in their very

undoubtedly attain the lotus feet of इ Krsna Caitanya, Lord Krsna Himself, with-
out delay.

vabhauma Bhattacarya. When a person actually revives his consciousness with
thoughts of Krsna by the mercy of अ Caitanya Mahaprabhu, he revives his
spiritual life and becomes addicted to the service of the Lord. Only then can he
act as an dcarya. In other words, everyone should engage in preaching, following
in the footsteps of का Caitanya Mahaprabhu. in this way one will be very much
appreciated by Lord Krsna and will quickly be recognized by Him. Actually a
devotee of आ Caitanya Mahaprabhu must engage in preaching in order to in-
crease the followers of the Lord. By thus preaching actual Vedic knowledge all
over the world, one will benefit all mankind.

CHAPTER 8
Talks Between Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu
and Ramananda Raya
The summary of the Eighth Chapter is given by Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura in the
Amrta-pravaha-bhasya.

After visiting the temple of Jiyada-nrsirmha, $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu went to
the banks of the River Godavari to a place known as Vidyanagara. When Srila
Ramananda Raya went there to take his bath, they both met. After being in-
troduced, ऽ Ramananda Raya requested $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu to remain in
the village for some days. Honoring his request, Caitanya Mahaprabhu stayed
there in the home of some Vedic brahmanas. In the evening, Srila Ramananda
Raya used to come to see Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Ramananda Raya, who was
clothed in ordinary dress, offered the Lord respectful obeisances. Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu questioned him on the object and process of worship and also asked
him to recite verses from Vedic literature.

First of all, Srila Ramananda Raya enunciated the system of the varpasrama in-
stitution. He recited various verses about karmarpana, stating that everything
should be dedicated to the Lord. He then spoke of detached action, knowledge
mixed with devotional service, and finally the spontaneous loving service of the
Lord. After hearing Srila Ramananda Raya recite some verses, ऽं Caitanya
Mahaprabhu accepted the principle of pure devotional service devoid of all the
kinds of speculation. After this, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu asked Ramananda Raya
to explain the higher platform of devotional service. Then $rila Rimananda Raya
explained unalloyed devotional service, love of Godhead, serving the Lord with
pure servitude as well as in fraternity and parental love. Finally he spoke of serving
the Lord in conjugal love. He then spoke of how conjugal love can be developed
in various ways. This conjugal love attains its highest perfection in Srimati
Radharant's love for Krsna. He next described the position of Srimati Radharani
and the transcendental mellows of love of God. Srila Rimananda Raya then
recited one verse of his own concerning the platform of ecstatic vision, tech-
nically called prema-vilasa-vivarta. Srila Raimananda Raya also explained that all
stages of conjugal love can be attained through the mercy of the residents of
Vrindavana, especially by the mercy of the gopis. All these subject matters were
thus vividly described. Gradually Ramananda Raya could understand the position
of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and when $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu exhibited His
real form, Ramananda Raya fell unconscious. After some days, $ri Caitanya


--- Page 83 ---
80 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 8
Mahaprabhu asked Ramananda Raya to retire from government service and come
to Jagannatha Puri. These descriptions of the meetings between Ramananda Raya
and Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu are taken from the notebook of Svaripa Damodara
Gosvami.

powered by the ocean to spread this water over the sea. Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu Himself was the ocean of knowledge of pure devotional service.

tana Gazetteer. About the temple, there are residential quarters for the priests and
devotees. Indeed, at the present moment there are many residential quarters to
accommodate visiting devotees. The original Deity is situated within the depths
of the temple, but there is another Deity, a duplicate, known as the vijaya-marti.
This smaller Deity can be moved from the temple and taken on public proces-
sions. Priests who generally belong to the Ramanuja-sampradaya are in charge of
the Deity worship.

tioned in Srimad-Bhagavatam in the First and Tenth Cantos by the great commen-
tator Srila Sridhara Svami. The following verse was composed by Sridhara Svami in
his commentary on Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.87.1).

“Lord Nrsirhhadeva is always assisted by Sarasvati, the goddess of learning, and He
is always embracing to His chest the goddess of fortune. The Lord is always com-
plete in knowledge within Himself. Let us offer obeisances unto Nrsirnhadeva”
Similarly, in his commentary on the First Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.1.1),
Sridhara Svami describes Lord Nrsirnhadeva in this way:
prahlada-hrdayahladar

“Let me offer my obeisances unto Lord Nrsirmhadeva, who is always enlightening
Prahlada Maharaja within his heart and who always kills the nescience that attacks
the devotees. His mercy is distributed like moonshine, and His face is like that of a
lion. Let me offer my obeisances unto Him again and again.”

TRANSLATION
While the brahmanas were thinking in this way about the activities of Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu and Ramananda Raya, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu saw the
brahmanas and restrained His transcendental emotions.
PURPORT
Ramananda Raya was intimately related to $rf Caitanya Mahaprabhu; therefore
he can be accepted as a sajatiya, a person within the intimate circle of the Lord.
The brahmanas, however, were followers of the Vedic rituals and were not able to
have an intimate connection with Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Consequently they
are called vijatiya-loka. In other words, they were not pure devotees. One may be
a highly learned brahmana, but if he is not a pure devotee he is a vijatiya, an out-
caste, one outside devotional service—in other words, a nondevotee. Although
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and Ramananda Raya were embracing in ecstasy, the
Lord restrained His transcendental emotions upon seeing the outsider brahmanas.

PURPORT
In Bhagavad-gita (9.32) the Lord says:


--- Page 101 ---
98 $ri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 8
marn hi partha vyapasritya
ye ‘pi syuh papa-yonayah
striyo vaisyas tatha sadras
te ‘pi yanti pararn gatim
“O son of Prtha, those who take shelter in Me, though they be of lower birth—
women, vaisyas [merchants], as well as sadras [workers] —can approach the
supreme destination.”

The word papa-yonayah means “born of lower caste women.” The vaisyas are
merchants, and the sadras or workers are servants. According to Vedic classifica-
tions, they belong to a lower social order. A low life means a life without Krsna
consciousness. High and low positions in society were calculated by considering a
person's Krsna consciousness. A brahmana is considered to be on the highest plat-
form because he knows Brahman, the Absolute Truth. The second caste, the
ksatriya caste, also know Brahman, but not as well as the brahmanas. The vaisyas
and 5५/25 do not clearly understand God consciousness, but if they take to Krsna
consciousness by the mercy of Krsna and the spiritual master, they do not remain
in the lower castes (papa-yonayah). It is clearly stated: te ‘pi yanti pararh gatim.

Unless one has attained the highest standard of life, one cannot return home,
back to Godhead. One may be a 5002, vaisya or woman, but if he is situated in
the service of the Lord in Krsna consciousness, he should not be considered str],
$adra, vaisya or one lower than a $0013. A person engaged in the Lord's service—
though from a lowborn family —should never be considered to belong to a
lowborn family. The Padma Purana forbids: viksate jati-samanyat/ sa yati narakarn
dhruvam. A person goes to hell quickly when he considers a devotee of the Lord
in terms of birth. Although $f Ramananda Raya supposedly took birth in a $00/3
family, he is not to be considered a sadra, for he was a great advanced devotee.
Indeed, he was on the transcendental platform. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu
therefore embraced him. Out of spiritual humility, 6 Ramananda Raya presented
himself as a $adra (raja-sevi visayi $adradhama). Even though one may engage in
government service or in any other pound-shilling-pence business—in short, in
materialistic life—he need only take to Krsna consciousness. Krsna consciousness
is a very simple process. One need only chant the holy names of the Lord and
strictly follow the principles forbidding sinful activity. In this way one can no
longer be considered an untouchable, a visayi or a $0013. One who is advanced in
spiritual life should not associate with nondevotees —namely men in government
service and men engaged in materialistic activity for sense gratification or in the
service of others. Such men are considered visayi, materialistic. It is said:

niskificanasya bhagavad-bhajanonmukhasya

Text 38] Talks Between the Lord and Rimananda Raya 99
“A person who is very seriously engaged in cultivating devotional service with a
view to crossing the ocean of nescience and who has completely abandoned all
material activities should never see a stidra, a vaiSya or a woman.” (Sri Caitanya-
candrodaya-nataka 8.23)

SYNONYMS
tomara krpaya—Your mercy; tomdya—unto You; kardya—induces; nindya-kar-
ma—forbidden actions; saksat i$vara—directly the Supreme Personality of Cod-
head; tumi—You; ke jane—who can know; tomdra—Your; marma—purpose.
TRANSLATION
“You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself; therefore no one
can understand Your purpose. By Your mercy, You are touching me, although
this is not sanctioned by the Vedas.
PURPORT
A sannyasi is strictly forbidden to see the visayis and materialistic people.
However, 6 Caitanya Mahaprabhu, out of His boundless and causeless mercy,
could show favor to anyone, regardless of birth and position.

TRANSLATION

१०४ have come here specifically to deliver me. You are so merciful that You

alone can deliver all fallen souls.
PURPORT
Srila Narottama dasa Thakura sings in his Prarthana (40):

Sri-krspa-caitanya-prabhu daya kara more,

toma vina ke dayalu jagat sarisare

patita-pavana-hetu tava avatara,

mo-sama patita prabhu na paibe ara
“My dear Lord, please be merciful to me. Who can be more merciful than Your
Lordship within these three worlds? You appear as an incarnation just to reclaim
the conditioned, fallen souls, but | assure You that You will not find a soul more
fallen than me.”

Sti Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s specific mission is to deliver fallen souls. Of course,
in this age of Kali there is hardly anyone who is not fallen according to the calcula-
tions of Vedic behavior. In His instructions to Rupa Gosvami, Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu described the so-called followers of Vedic religion in this way
(Madhya 19.146):

veda-nistha-madhye ardheka veda ‘mukhe’ mane
veda-nisiddha papa kare, dharma nahi gane

So-called followers of Vedic principles simply accept the Vedas formally, but
they act against Vedic principles. This is symptomatic of this age of Kali. People
claim to follow a certain type of religion, saying formally, “I am Hindu, | am
Muslim, | am Christian, 1am this or that,” but actually no one follows the principles
enunciated in religious scriptures. This is the disease of this age. However, the
merciful $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has simply advised us to chant the Hare Krsna
maha-mantra: harer nama harer nama harer nama eva kevalam. The Lord can
deliver anyone and everyone, even though one may have fallen from the injunc-
tions of revealed scriptures. This is ऽ Caitanya Mahaprabhu'’s special mercy. Con-
sequently He is known as patita-pavana, the deliverer of all fallen souls.

mahanta-svabhava ei tarite pamara
nija karya nahi tabu yana tara ghara
SYNONYMS
mahanta-svabhava—the nature of saintly persons; ei—this; tarite—to deliver;
pamara—fallen souls; nija—own; karya—business; nahi—there is not; tabu—
still; yana—goes; tara—his; ghara—house.
TRANSLATION
“It is the general practice of all saintly people to deliver the fallen.
Therefore they go to people’s houses, although they have no personal busi-
ness there.
PURPORT
A sannyasT is supposed to beg from door to door. He does not beg simply be-
cause he is hungry. His real purpose is to enlighten the occupant of every house
by preaching Krsna consciousness. A sannyasi does not abandon his superior posi-
tion and become a beggar just for the sake of begging. Similarly, a person in
householder life may be very important, but he may also voluntarily take to the
mendicant way of life. Ripa Gosvami and Sanatana Gosvami were ministers, but
they voluntarily accepted the mendicant’s life in order to humbly preach ऽ
Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s message. It is said about them: tyaktva tdrnam asesa-
mandala-pati-srenim sada tucchavat bhdtva dina-ganesakau karunaya kaupina-
kanthasritau. Although the Cosvamis were very aristocratic, they became mendi-
cants just to deliver the fallen souls according to the order of ऽते Caitanya
Mahaprabhu. One should also consider that those who engage in the missionary
activities of Krsna consciousness are under the guidance of Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu. They are not actually beggars; their real business is to deliver fallen
souls. Therefore they may go from door to door just to introduce a book about
Krsna consciousness so that people can become enlightened by reading. Formerly
brahmacaris and sannyasis used to beg from door to door. At the present
moment, especially in the Western countries, a person may be handed over to the
police if he begs from door to door. In Western countries, begging is considered
criminal. Members of the Krsna consciousness movement have no business beg-
ging. Instead, they work very hard to introduce some literatures about Krsna con-
sciousness so that people can read them and be benefited. However, if one gives
some contribution to a Krsna conscious man, he never refuses it.

the Supreme Personality of Godhead; laksana—the symptoms; jive—in an ordi-
nary living being; na —not; sambhave —possible; ei—these; aprakrta—transcen-

TRANSLATION
“My dear sir, according to Your bodily features and Your behavior, You are
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such behavior and features are impos-
sible for ordinary living beings, for they cannot possess such transcendental
qualities.”
PURPORT
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu'’s bodily features were uncommon. Indeed, His body
was extraordinary in its measurements. The measurement of His chest as well as
the measurement of His forearms were the same length. This is called nyagrodha-
parimandala. As far as His nature is concerned, He was kind to everyone. No one
but the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be kind to everyone. Therefore the
Lord's name is Krsna, all-attractive. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (14.4), Krsna is kind
to everyone. In every species of life (sarva-yonisu), He is the original father, the
seed-giver (bija-pradah pita). How, then, can He be unkind to any living entity?


--- Page 107 ---
104 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 8
One may be a man, an animal or even a tree, but the Lord is kind to everyone.
That is God's qualification. He also says in Bhagavad-gita (9.29), samo ham sarva-
bhdatesu: the Lord is equally kind to everyone. And He advises sarva-dharman
parityajya mam ekarh saraparn vraja. This instruction is meant not only for Arjuna
but for all living entities. Whoever takes advantage of this offer is immediately im-
mune to all sinful activity and returns home, back to Godhead. While present on
this planet, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu made the same offer.

of the topmost devotees; tomdra darsane—by seeing you; sabara—of everyone;
drava—melted; haila—became; mana—the heart.

TRANSLATION

The Lord replied to Ramananda Raya: ‘‘Sir, you are the best of the topmost

devotees; therefore upon seeing you everyone's heart has melted.
PURPORT

Unless one is a first-class devotee, he cannot be a preacher. A preacher is
generally a topmost devotee, but in order to meet the general populace, he has to
come to distinguish between devotees and nondevotees. Otherwise, an ad-
vanced devotee makes no such distinctions. Indeed, he always sees everyone
engaged in the service of the Lord. When one engages in preaching work, he must
distinguish between people and understand that some people are not engaged in
the devotional service of the Lord. The preacher then has to take compassion
upon such innocent people who do not know how to worship the Lord. In
Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.2.45), the symptoms of a topmost devotee are described
as follows:

sarva-bhatesu yah pasyed
bhagavad-bhavam atmanah
bhatani bhagavaty atmany
esa bhagavatottamah

PURPORT
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu accepted the invitation of the Vaisnava brahmana.
Even though one is a brahmana strictly following all the rules and regulations of
brahminical culture, if he is not a devotee, a follower of $i Caitanya Mahaprabhu,
one should not accept his invitation. At the present moment, people have be-
come so degraded that they do not even follow the Vedic principles, to say
nothing of Vaisnava principles. They eat anything and everything—whatever they
like —and therefore the members of this Krsna consciousness movement should
be very cautious about accepting invitations.

bathing, decorate his body with the twelve tilakas.

Sr Caitanya Mahaprabhu; kaila—did; alingane—embracing; dui—two; jane —
the persons; krsna-katha—talks about Krsna; kaya—discussed; rahah-sthane—in
a secluded place.
TRANSLATION
Ramananda Raya approached Lord Sri Caitanya and offered his respectful
obeisances, and the Lord embraced him. Then they both began to discuss
Krsna in a secluded place.
PURPORT
The word rahah-sthane, “in a secluded place,’ is very significant. Talks about
Krsna and His pastimes —especially His pastimes in Vrndavana and His dealings
with the gopis—are all very confidential. They are not subject matter for public
discussion because those who have no understanding of the transcendental
nature of Krsna's pastimes always commit great offenses, thinking Krsna to be an
ordinary human being and the gopis ordinary girls. Following the principle of Lord
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who never discussed the dealings between Krsna and
the gopis publicly, devotees in the Krsna consciousness movement are enjoined
not to discuss the pastimes of Lord Krsna in Vrndavana in public. For the general
public, sankirtana is the most effective method to awaken Krsna consciousness. If
possible, one should discuss the principles enunciated in Bhagavad-gita. Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu followed this principle very strictly and discussed the phi-
losophy of Bhagavad-gita with learned scholars like Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya and
Prakasananda Sarasvati. However, He taught the principles of the bhakti cult to
students like Sanatana Gosvami and Rapa Gosvami, and He discussed with Sri
Ramananda Raya the topmost devotional dealings between Krsna and the gopis.
For the general populace, He performed sankirtana very vigorously. We must also
follow these principles in preaching Krsna consciousness all over the world.

verse from the revealed scriptures; sadhyera—of the aim of life; nirnaya—an
ascertainment; rdya kahe—Ramananda Raya replied; sva-dharma-acarane—by

TRANSLATION

Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu ordered Ramananda Raya to recite a verse from
the revealed scriptures concerning the ultimate goal of life. Ramananda
replied that if one executes the prescribed duties of his social position, he
awakens his original Krsna consciousness.

PURPORT

In this connection, ऽ Ramanujacarya stated in the Vedartha-sargraha that
devotional service is naturally very dear to the living entity. Indeed, it is life's goal.
This devotional service is supreme knowledge, or Krsna consciousness, and it
brings detachment from all material activity. In the transcendental position, a liv-
ing being can perfectly acknowledge the superiority of serving the Supreme Lord.
The devotees attain the Supreme Lord only by devotional service. Having such
knowledge, one engages in his occupational duty, and that is called bhakti-yoga.
By performing bhakti-yoga, one can rise to the platform of pure devotional ser-
vice.

A great saint, the father of Srila Vyasadeva, Parasara Muni, has specifically men-
tioned that devotional service to the Lord can ultimately be awakened in human
society by the discharge of duties in accordance with the varpasrama. The
Supreme Personality of Godhead instituted varpasrama-dharma to give human
beings a chance to return home, back to Godhead. The Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Lord ঠা Krsna, who is known in Bhagavad-gita as Purusottama—the
greatest of all personalities —personally came and declared that the institution of
varnasrama-dharma was founded by Him. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (4.13):

caturvarnyarn maya srstam
guna-karma-vibhagasah

tasya kartaram api marn
viddhy akartaram avyayam

Elsewhere in Bhagavad-gita (18.45-46) the Lord says:

sve sve karmany abhiratah
৩8110510077 labhate narah


--- Page 115 ---
112 $ri Caitanya-caritaimrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 8
sva-karma-niratah siddhiri
yatha vindati tac chrou
yatah pravrttir bhatanarin
yena sarvam idarn tatam
sva-karmana tam abhyarcya
siddhirin  vindati manavah
Human society should be divided into four divisions—brahmana, ksatriya,
vaisya and stidra—and everyone should always engage in his occupational duty.
The Lord says that those engaged in their occupational duty can attain perfection
simply by rendering loving devotional service to the Lord while executing their
particular duty. Actually the modern ideal of a classless society can be introduced
only by Krsna consciousness. Let men perform their occupational duty, and let
them give their profits to the service of the Lord. In other words, one can attain
the perfection of life by discharging one’s occupational duty and employing the
results in the service of the Lord. This method is confirmed by great personalities
like Bodhayana, Tanka, Dramida, Guhadeva, Kapardi and Bharuci. It is also con-
firmed by Vedanta-satra.

“The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Visnu, is worshiped by the
proper execution of prescribed duties in the system of varna and asrama.
There is no other way to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One
must be situated in the institution of the four varnas and asramas.”

Text 58] Talks Between the Lord and Ramananda Raya 113
PURPORT

This is a quotation from the Visnu Purana (3.8.9). As stated by Srila Bhaktivinoda
Thakura in his Amrta-pravaha-bhasya: “The purport is that one can realize life's
perfection simply by satisfying the Supreme Personality of Godhead.” This is also
confirmed in Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.13):

atah pumbhir dvija-srestha
varnasrama-vibhagasah
svanusthitasya dharmasya
samsiddhir hari-tosanam
“O best among the twiceborn, it is therefore concluded that the highest perfec-
tion one can achieve, by discharging his prescribed duties [dharmal according to
caste divisions and order of life, is to please the Lord Hari.”

Every man should perform his occupational duty in the light of his particular
tendency. According to his abilities, one should accept a position in the var-
nasrama institution. The divisions of brahmara, ksatriya, vaisya and sadra are
natural divisions within society. Indeed, everyone has a prescribed duty according
to the varpasrama-dharma. Those who properly execute their prescribed duties
live peacefully and are not disturbed by material conditions. The spiritual orders —
brahmacarya, grhastha, vanaprastha and sannyasa— are called asramas. If one exe-
cutes his prescribed duty in both the social and spiritual order, the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead is satisfied. If one neglects his duties, however, he becomes a
transgressor and a candidate for a hellish condition. Actually we see that different
people are engaged in different ways; therefore there must be divisions according
to work. To attain perfection, one must make devotional service the center of life.
In this way one can awaken his natural instincts by work, association and educa-
tion. One should accept the varpasrama divisions by qualification, not by birth.
Unless this system is introduced, human activities cannot be systematically ex-
ecuted.

The brahmanas are the intellectuals who can understand the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead. They are always engaged in the cultivation of knowledge. It
does not matter whether one is born in India or outside India. Those who are
naturally very heroic and who tend to rule over others are called ksatriyas. Those
who tend to produce food by agricultural methods, protect cows and other
animals and engage in trade are called vaisyas, or merchants. Those who are not
sufficiently intelligent to be brahmanas, ksatriyas or vaisyas are required to serve a
master and are called sadras. Thus everyone can engage in the service of the Lord
and Krsna consciousness. If a society does not function according to such natural
divisions, the social orders become degraded. The conclusion is that the scientific
method of varpasrama-dharma should be adopted by society.

Text 61] Talks Between the Lord and Rimananda Raya 115
Ramananda replied with this verse from Bhagavad-gita (9.27) that while remaining
in the system of varpasrama-dharma, one may offer the results of his activities to
Lord ऽन Krsna in loving service. Naturally Lord $rf Caitanya Mahaprabhu was ask-
ing Ramananda Raya about the execution of devotional service. Ramananda Raya
first enunciated the principle of varpasrama-dharma in consideration of ma-
terialistic people. However, this conception is not transcendental. As long as one
is in the material world, he must follow the principles of varnasrama-dharma, but
devotional service is transcendental. The system of varpasrama-dharma refers to
the three modes of material nature, but transcendental devotional service is on
the absolute platform. ऽ Caitanya Mahaprabhu belonged to the spiritual world,
and His methods for propagating the sankirtana movement were also imported
from the spiritual world. Srila Narottama dasa Thakura has sung: golokera prema-
dhana, hari-nama-sankirtana, rati na janmila kene tdya. This states that the
sankirtana movement has nothing to do with this material world. It is imported
from the spiritual world, Coloka Vrndavana. Narottama dasa Thakura laments that
mundane people do not take this sarikirtana movement seriously. Considering the
position of devotional service and the sankirtana movement, Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu deemed the system of varpasrama-dharma to be material, although
it aims at elevation to the spiritual platform. However, the sankirtana movement
can raise one immediately to the spiritual platform. Consequently it is said that
varpasrama-dharma is external, and Caitanya Mahaprabhu requested Ramananda
Raya to proceed deeper into the matter and uncover the spiritual platform.

Sometimes materialists consider Lord Visnu a material conception. Imper-
sonalists think that above Lord Visnu is the impersonal Brahman. The imper-
sonalists misunderstand the worship of Lord Visnu. They worship Lord Visnu to
merge into His body. In order that vispu-aradhana not be misunderstood, rf
Caitanya Mahaprabhu requested that 67 Ramananda Raya proceed further and
clear up the issue. Ramananda Raya quoted the verse from Bhagavad-gita stating
that the results of one’s occupational duty may be offered to Lord Visnu or Krsna.
In $rimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.8) it is also said:

dharmah svanusthitah pursari
visvaksena-kathasu yah
notpadayed yadi ratim
$rama eva hi kevalam
“If one executes the occupational duties of varpasrama-dharma but does not
cultivate his dormant Krsna consciousness, his activities are futile. His occupation
simply becomes unnecessary labor.”

PURPORT
A brahmana may renounce his family and accept sannyasa. Others also—
ksatriyas and vaisyas —may also give up their families and take to Krsna conscious-
ness. Such renunciation is called karma-tyaga. By such renunciation, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead is satisfied. However, this renouncing of one’s activities to
Krsna is not uncontaminated and is therefore on the material platform. Such ac-
tivities are considered within the material universe because, according to ऽ
Caitanya Mahaprabhu, they refer to the material universe and are therefore exter-
nal. To correct this, Ramananda Raya recommended that one take to the
renounced order of life in order to transcend material activities. This is supported
by the following verse from Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.11.32).

He has thus enjoined that we should not perform religious or irreligious activities
as prescribed in the Vedas. The best course is to engage always in the service of
Lord Krsna and Radharant. That is the perfection of everything in this life. Similarly,

TRANSLATION
After hearing Ramananda Riya speak in this way, Lord Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu said, “Go ahead and say something more.” Ramananda Raya
then replied, ‘Devotional service mixed with empiric knowledge is the
essence of perfection.”
PURPORT
Devotional service mixed with non-Vedic speculative knowledge is certainly
not pure devotional service. Therefore Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati in his
Anubhasya preached that self-realization following the execution of ritualistic
ceremonies is in the neutral stage between liberation and conditional life. It is the
place beyond this material world in the River Viraja, where the three modes of
material nature are subdued or neutralized in the unmanifest stage. However, in
the spiritual world is a manifestation of spiritual energy, known as Vaikunthaloka
where there is no anxiety. The material world is known as brahmanda. The ma-
terial universe is the creation of the external energy. Between the two creations —
the material creation and the spiritual creation—is a river known as Viraja as well
as a place known as Brahmaloka. Virajanadi and Brahmaloka are shelters for living
entities disgusted with material life and inclined to impersonal existence by way
of denying material variegatedness. Since these places are not situated in the
Vaikunthalokas or the spiritual world, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu proclaims them to
be external. In the Brahmaloka and Virajanadi, one cannot conceive of the
Vaikunthalokas. Brahmaloka and Virajanadi are also attained after difficult
austerities, but in these realms there is no understanding of the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead and His transcendental loving service. Without such spiritual


--- Page 122 ---
Text 66] Talks Between the Lord and Ramananda Raya 119
knowledge, simple detachment from material conditions is but another side of
material existence. From the spiritual point of view, it is all external. When তা
Caitanya Mahaprabhu rejected this proposal, Ramananda Raya suggested that
devotional service based on philosophy and logic is a more progressed position.
He therefore quoted the following verse from Bhagavad-gita (18.54).
TEXT 65

SYNONYMS
brahma-bhdtah—freed from material conceptions of life but attached to an im-
personal situation; prasanna-atma—fully joyful; na Socati—he does not lament;
na kanksati—he does not hanker; samah—equally disposed; sarvesu—all;
bhatesu —to the living entities; mat-bhaktim—My devotional service; labhate —
achieves; param —transcendental.
TRANSLATION
Ramananda Raya continued, ‘According to Bhagavad-gita: ‘One who is
thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and be-
comes fully joyful. He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is
equally disposed to every living entity. In that state he attains pure devotional
service unto Me.’ ^“
PURPORT
In Bhagavad-gita it is said that a person who accepts the theory of monism—
being always engaged in empiric philosophical discussions about spiritual life—
becomes joyful and is relieved from all material lamentation and hankering. At
that stage, one is equipoised. He sees all living entities as spiritual beings. After at-
taining this elevated stage, one can attain pure devotional service. The conclusion
is that devotional service mixed with ritualistic fruitive activity is inferior to
spiritual service based on empiric philosophic discussion.

TRANSLATION

After hearing this, the Lord, as usual, rejected it, considering it to be exter-
nal devotional service. He again asked Ramananda Raya to speak further, and
Ramananda Raya replied, “Pure devotional service without any touch of
speculative knowledge is the essence of perfection.”

PURPORT

Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura in his Anubhasya commentary says that
this stage—devotional service mixed with speculative knowledge —is also exter-
nal and not within the jurisdiction of pure devotional service as practiced in
Vaikunthaloka. As soon as there is some conception of materialistic thought—be
it positive or negative—the service is not spiritual. It may be free from material
contamination, but because there is mental speculation the devotional service is
not pure and freed from the contamination of material life. A living entity who
wants to be completely pure must be above this material conception. The nega-
tion of material existence does not necessarily mean spiritual existence. After ma-
terial existence is negated, spiritual existence —namely sac-cid-ananda—still may
not be manifest. Until one comes to the stage of actually understanding one’s
eternal relationship with the Supreme Lord, he cannot enter into spiritual life.
Spiritual life means becoming detached from material life and engaging in the lov-
ing service of the Lord. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu therefore asked Ramananda
Raya to explain something transcendental to devotional service mixed with
speculative knowledge. A pure devotee is completely surrendered to the lotus
feet of the Lord, and only by his love does he conquer Krsna, who cannot be con-
quered by anyone. Krsna always stands victorious over everything. No one can
conquer Him. One can attain the stage of pure devotion simply by fully surrender-
ing. This is next corroborated by Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.14.3), wherein Lord
Brahma, defeated by the potency of ज Krsna, fully surrendered unto the Lord.

At this point, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu replied, “This is all right, but still
you can speak more on the subject.” Raimananda Raya then replied, ‘Ecstatic
love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the essence of all perfection.”

PURPORT

In this connection, $rila Bhaktivinoda Thakura in his Amrta-pravaha-bhasya says
that after hearing Ramananda Raya, Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu said, eho haya,
age kaha ara. This means that this is the process accepted in devotional service,
but there is something more than this. Therefore Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu re-
quested him to explain what was beyond. Simply executing the duties of all var
nas and asramas is not as good as offering all the results of one’s activities to the
Lord. When one gives up all fruitive activity and fully surrenders to the Lord, he at-
tains sva-dharma-tyaga, wherein he abandons the social order and takes to the
renounced order. That is certainly better. However, better than the renounced
order is cultivation of knowledge mixed with devotional service. Yet all these ac-
tivities are external to the activities of the spiritual world. There is no touch of
pure devotional service in them. Pure devotional service cannot be attained by
empiric philosophy, nor can perfection be attained simply by good association.
Devotional service by self-realization is a different subject matter. It is untouched
by fruitive activity, for one surrenders the results of activities to the Lord, aban-
dons prescribed duties and accepts the renounced order of life. Such devotional
service is situated on a higher platform than that of empiric philosophical specula-
tion with a mixture of bhakti. This is verified by Srila Rapa Gosvami in his Bhakti-
rasamrta-sindhu (1.1.11):

anyabhilasita-sanyar
jhdna-karmady-anavrtam
anukalyena krsnanu-
Silanam bhaktir uttama
“One should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord Krsna
favorably and without desire for material profit or gain through fruitive activities
or philosophical speculation. That is called pure devotional service.”

Devotional activities, however, sometimes appear to be impure in the
neophyte stage, but in the mature stage they are completely pure from material
activity. Therefore Ramananda Raya replied after hearing the last statement of Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu:  prema-bhakti—sarva-sadhya-sara. Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu actually accepted this verse (jidne prayasam) as the basic principle
of perfection. One has to practice this principle in order to make further progress.
When further progress is actually made, one comes to the platform of ecstatic
loving service to the Lord. This first stage is technically called sadhana-bhakti, or


--- Page 126 ---
Text 70] Talks Between the Lord and Rimananda Raya 123
devotional service in practice. The result of sadhana-bhakti must be ecstatic love,
attachment for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, which is also called prema-
bhakti. In the neophyte stage, sadhana-bhakti includes faith, association with
devotees, and practicing devotional service. Thus one is freed from all unwanted
things. One then becomes fixed in devotional service and increases his desire to
act in devotional service. Thus one becomes attached to the Lord and His devo-
tional service.

where, one must purchase it without delay.’ ^^
PURPORT
The previous two verses are included in the Padyavali (13,14) by Srila Rapa
Gosvami. Verse sixty-nine refers to devotional service in faith, and verse seventy
refers to devotional service rendered out of intense greed. The first is devotional
service rendered in accordance to the regulative principles, and the second refers
to spontaneous loving service of the Lord without extraneous endeavor.
Henceforward the basic principle underlying the talks between $i Caitanya
Mahaprabhu and Ramananda Raya will be spontaneous loving service to the Lord.
The regulative principles according to the injunctions of the sastras are necessary
insofar as one’s original dormant Krsna consciousness is not spontaneously
awakened. An example of spontaneous action is the flowing of rivers into the
ocean. Nothing can stop this flow of water. Similarly, when one’s dormant Krsna
consciousness is awakened, it spontaneously flows to the lotus feet of Krsna with-
out impediment. Whatever will be spoken henceforth by Ramananda Raya based
on spontaneous love will be agreeable to ऽ Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and the Lord
will ask him more and more about this subject.

mamata. Between the servitor and the served, there is a feeling of oneness. This
mamata begins with dasya-prema, service rendered to the master by the servant.
Unless there is such a relationship, the loving affairs between the Lord and His
devotee are not actually fixed. When the devotee feels, “The Lord is my master”
and renders service unto Him, Krsna consciousness is awakened. This fixed con-
sciousness is on a higher platform than simple cognizance of love of Godhead.

This is a quotation from Srimad-Bhagavatam (9.5.16) and is an admission by the
great sage Durvasa Muni. Durvasa Muni, a caste brahmana and great yogi, used to
hate Maharaja Ambarisa. When he decided to chastise Maharaja Ambarisa
through his yogic powers, he was chased by the Sudar$ana cakra of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. When things were settled, he said, “When the holy name
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is heard by any person, that person is im-
mediately sanctified. The Supreme Lord is master of the devotees, and the devo-
tees, under His shelter, naturally come to own His opulences.”

SYNONYMS

prabhu kahe—the Lord said; eho haya—this is also right; kichu—something;
age—ahead; ara—more; raya kahe—Ramananda Raya replied; sakhya-prema—
transcendental loving service in fraternity; sarva-sadhya-sara—the highest perfec-

TRANSLATION

Hearing this from Ramananda Raya, the Lord again requested him to go a
step further. In reply, Rimananda Raya said, ‘‘Loving service to Krsna rendered
in fraternity is the highest perfection.

PURPORT

As long as loving service is rendered to the Lord in the master-servant relation-
ship, there is some fear, for the servant is always afraid of the master, despite the
intimacy of self-interest. In this stage the servant is always afraid of the master and
respectful of Him. When the devotee is further advanced, he has nothing to fear.
He considers the Lord and himself on an equal level. At such a time, the devotee is
fully convinced that Lord Krsna is a friend and cannot at all be dissatisfied if the
devotee lives with Him on an equal level. This understanding is called visrambha,
that is, devoid of a respectful attitude. When this attitude is chosen, it becomes
sakhya-prema, or love of Godhead in friendship. On this stage there is developed
consciousness of equality between the Lord and the devotee.

In general, love of Godhead is devoid of the intimacy of ownership. In the case
of love in servitude, there is a want of confidence. There is a want of increased
affection in the fraternal relationship, but when this affection increases in the
paternal relationship, there is nonetheless a want of complete freedom. However,
when one becomes a conjugal lover of Krsna, everything lacking in the other rela-

ecstatic love for Krsna in separation manifested by the gopis, he appreciated their

the fortune of the gopis could not be compared even to the fortune of the god-

In this regard, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura explains that this verse
does not advocate the whimsical invention of some methods of love of Godhead.
Such inventions cannot be accepted as topmost. Indeed, such concoctions are
not recommended in these verses. Srila Ripa Gosvami has said in the Bhakti-
rasamrta-sindhu (1.2.101):
Sruti-smrti-puranadi-
pancaratra-vidhirn vina
aikantiki harer bhaktir

134 $ri Caitanya-caritimrta [Madhya-lili, Ch. 8
He clearly mentions in this verse that one must refer to the Vedic literatures and
other supplementary literatures and follow the conclusion of the Vedas. An in-
vented devotional attitude simply creates disturbances in the transcendental
realm. If a person overly addicted to family life takes to Srimad-Bhagavatam or
Krsna consciousness to earn a livelihood, his activity is certainly offensive. One
should not become a caste guru and sell mantras for the benefit of mundane
customers, nor should one make disciples for a livelihood. All these activities are
offensive. One should not make a livelihood by forming a professional band to
carry out congregational chanting, nor should one perform devotional service
when one is attached to mundane society, friendship and love. Nor should one be
dependent on so-called social etiquette. All of this is mental speculation. None of
these things can be compared to unalloyed devotional service. No one can com-
pare unalloyed devotional service, Krsna consciousness, to mundane activities.
There are many unauthorized parties pretending to belong to the Sri Caitanya
cult, and some are known as: aula, baula, karttabhaja, neda, daravesa, sani,
sakhibheki, smarta, jata-gosani, ativadi, cadadhari and gauranga-nagari.
Moreover, there are those who take the caste gosvamis’ opinion of such parties
as bona fide, comparing their opinions to those of the six Gosvamis headed by Sti
Rapa and Sri Sanatana. This is simply another cheating process. There are also
nondevotees who compose unauthorized songs, who establish different temples
for money, who worship the Deity as priests for salaries, who accept caste
brahmanism as all in all and who do not know the value of a pure Vaisnava. Ac-
tually the caste brahmanas of the smarta community are opposed to the principles
of the Satvata-parcaratra. Furthermore, there are many Mayavadis and those
overly addicted to material sense enjoyment. None of these can be compared to
a person who is purely engaged in preaching Krsna consciousness. Every Krsna
conscious person is constantly endeavoring to utilize different transcendental
devices in the service of the Lord. Such a devotee renounces all material enjoy-
ment and completely dedicates himself to the service of his spiritual master and
Lord ऽ Caitanya Mahaprabhu. He may be a perfect celibate, a restrained house-
holder, a regulated vanaprastha, or a tridandi-sannyasi in the renounced order. It
doesn’t matter. The pseudo-transcendentalists and the pure devotees cannot be
compared, nor can one argue that a person can invent his own way of worship.
The purport in presenting this verse necessitates explaining the comparative
positions of the transcendental mellows known as $anta, dasya, sakhya, vatsalya
and madhurya. All these rasas, or mellows, are situated on the transcendental plat-
form. Pure devotees take shelter of one of them and thus progress in spiritual life.
Actually one can take shelter of such spiritual mellows only when one is com-
pletely uncontaminated by material attachment. When one is completely free
from material attachment, the feelings of the transcendental mellows are
awakened in the heart of the devotee. That is svarapa-siddhi, the perfection of


--- Page 138 ---
Text 84] Talks Between the Lord and Ramananda Raya 135
one's eternal relationship with the Supreme Lord. Svartipa-siddhi, the eternal rela-
tionship with the Supreme Lord, may be situated in one of the transcendental
mellows. Each and every one of them is as perfect as the others. However, by
comparative study an unbiased person can realize that the mellow of servitorship
is better than the mellow of neutrality. The mellow of fraternity is better than the
mellow of servitorship. Similarly, the mellow of paternity is better than that of fra-
ternity. Above all the mellows is the mellow of conjugal love. However, these are
all spiritually situated on the same platform because all these relationships of per-
fection in love are based on a central point—Krsna.

These mellows cannot be compared to the feelings one derives from demigod
worship. Krsna is one, but the demigods are different. They are material. Love for
Krsna cannot be compared to material love for different demigods. Because
Mayavadis are on the material platform, they recommend the worship of Siva or
Durga and say that worship of Kali and Krsna are the same. However, on the
spiritual platform there is no demigod worship. The only worshipable object is
Krsna. Therefore although there is no difference between a devotee in $anta-rasa
or dasya-rasa, vatsalya-rasa or madhurya-rasa, one can still make a comparative
study of the intensity of love in these different transcendental positions. For ex-
ample, it may be said that dasya-rasa is better than santa-rasa, yet transcendental
love of God is there in both of them. Similarly, we can judge that love of Godhead
in fraternity is better than love of Godhead in neutrality and servitorship. Similarly,
love of Godhead in paternal affection is better than love in fraternity. And, as
stated before, love of God in the conjugal rasa is superior to that in the paternal
rasa.

The analysis of different types of love of Godhead has been made by expert
acaryas who know all about devotional service on the transcendental platform.
Unfortunately, inexperienced and unauthorized persons in the mundane world,
not understanding the transcendental position of pure love, try to find some ma-
terial fault in the transcendental process. This is simply impudence on the part of
spiritually inexperienced people. Such faultfinding is symptomatic of unfortunate
mundane wranglers.

TRANSLATION

“Complete attainment of the lotus feet of Lord Krsna is made possible by
love of Godhead, specifically madhurya-rasa or conjugal love. Lord Krsna is
indeed captivated by this standard of love. This is also stated in Srimad-
Bhagavatam.

PURPORT

To explain the topmost quality of conjugal love, Srila Krsnadasa Kaviraja
Gosvami gives the example of the material elements—sky, air, fire, water and
earth. In the sky (space) there is the quality of sound. Similarly, in air there are the
qualities of sound and touch. In fire, there are three qualities—sound, touch and
form. In water there are four qualities—sound, touch, form and taste. Finally, in
earth there are all five qualities—sound, touch, form, taste and also smell. Now,
one can see that the quality of the sky is in all—namely in air, fire, water and earth.
In earth we can find all the qualities of material nature. The same can be applied
to the rasa known as madhurya-rasa, or conjugal love. In conjugal love there are
the qualities of neutrality, servitorship, fraternity and paternity as well as conjugal
love itself. The conclusion is that through conjugal love, the Lord is completely
satisfied.

Conjugal love (madhurya-rasa) is also known as $rigara-rasa. It is the conclusion
of Srimad-Bhagavatam that in the complete combination of loving service to the
Lord—namely in conjugal love—the Supreme Lord fully agrees to be under the
control of the devotee. The highest form of conjugal love is represented by
Srimati Radharani; therefore in the pastimes of Radha and Krsna we can see that
Krsna is always subjugated by Srimati Radharant's influence.

TRANSLATION
‘Lord Krsna told the gopis: ‘The means of attaining My favor is loving ser-
vice unto Me, and fortunately you are all thus engaged. Those living beings
who render service unto Me are eligible to be transferred to the spiritual
world and attain eternal life with knowledge and bliss.’
PURPORT
The fulfillment of human life is summarized in this verse from Srimad-
Bhagavatam (10.82.45). There are two important words in this verse: bhakti
(devotional service) and amrtatva (eternal life). The aim of human life is to attain
the natural position of eternal life. This eternal life can be achieved only by devo-
tional service.

times; ache—there is; ye—anyone; yaiche—just as; bhaje—renders service;

TRANSLATION
‘Lord Krsna has made a firm promise for all time. If one renders service
unto Him, Krsna correspondingly gives him an equal amount of success in
devotional service to the Lord.
PURPORT
It is a completely mistaken idea that one can worship Krsna in any form or in
any way and still attain the ultimate result by receiving the favor of the Lord. This
is a decision made by gross materialistic men. Generally such men say that you
can manufacture your own way of worshiping the Supreme Lord and that any
type of worship is sufficient to approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Certainly there are different means for attaining different results in fruitive activity,
speculative knowledge, mystic yoga, and austerity. Crude men therefore say that
if one adopts any of these methods, one achieves the Supreme Personality of
GCodhead's favor. They claim that it doesn't matter what kind of method one


--- Page 143 ---
140 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 8
adopts. A general example is given. If one wishes to arrive at a certain place, there
are many roads leading there, and one can go to that place by any one of these
roads. Similarly, these gross materialists say that there are different ways to attain
the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They claim that one can con-
ceive of the Supreme Personality of Godhead as goddess Durga, goddess Kali,
Lord Siva, demigod Ganesa, Lord Ramacandra, Krsna, impersonal Brahman or
whatever, and one can chant the Lord's name in any way and in any form and
ultimately become one. Such materialists claim that the result is the same. They
also say that a man may have different names, but he will answer if called by any
one of them. Therefore they claim that there is no need to chant the Hare Krsna
mantra. If one chants the name of Kali, Durga, Siva, (11658 or anyone else, the
result will be the same. Such claims made by mental speculators are no doubt
very pleasing to mental speculators, but those who are actually in knowledge do
not admit such conclusions, which are against the authority of the $astras. A bona
fide acarya will certainly not accept such a conclusion. As Krsna clearly states in
Bhagavad-gita:
yanti deva-vrata devan
pitrh yanti pitr-vratah
bhatani yanti bhatejya
yanti mad-yajino ‘pi mam
“Those who worship the demigods will take birth among the demigods; those
who worship ghosts and spirits will take birth among such beings; those who
worship ancestors go to the ancestors; and those who worship Me will live with
Me” (Bg. 9.25)

Only the devotees of the Lord can be admitted to His kingdom—not the
demigod worshipers, karmis, yogis, or anyone else. A person who desires eleva-
tion to the heavenly planets worships various demigods, and material nature may
be pleased to offer such devotees their desired positions. Consequently material
nature gives one one’s own nature by which he increases affection for different
types of demigods. However, Bhagavad-gita says that demigod worship is meant
for men who have lost all their intelligence.

kamais (315 tair hrta-jhanah
prapadyante ‘nya-devatah
tam tarn niyamam asthaya
prakrtya niyatah svaya
“Those whose minds are distorted by material desires surrender unto demigods
and follow the particular rules and regulations of worship according to their own
natures.” (Bg. 7.20)


--- Page 144 ---
Text 90] Talks Between the Lord and Rimananda Raya 141

Although one may be elevated to the heavenly planets, the results of such
benediction are limited.

antavat tu phalam tesam
tad bhavaty alpa-medhasam
devan deva-yajo yanti
mad-bhakta yanti mam api
“Men of small intelligence worship the demigods, and their fruits are limited and
temporary. Those who worship the demigods go to the planets of the demigods,
but My devotees ultimately reach My supreme planet.” (Bg. 7.23)

Being elevated to the heavenly planets or other material planets does not mean
attaining an eternal life of knowledge and bliss. At the end of the material world,
all attainments of material elevation will also end. Again, according to Krsna in
Bhagavad-gita, only those who engage in His loving devotional service will be ad-
mitted to the spiritual world and return to Godhead, not others.

bhaktya mam abhijanati
yavan yas casmi tattvatah
tato mam tattvato jiatva
visate tad-anantaram
“One can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional service.
And when one is in full consciousness of the Supreme Lord by such devotion, he
can enter into the kingdom of God.” (Bg. 18.55)

Impersonalists cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead;
therefore it is not possible for them to enter into the spiritual kingdom of God and
return home, back to Godhead. Actually one attains different results by different
means. It is not that all achievements are one and the same. Those interested in
the four principles of dharma, artha, kama and moksa cannot be compared to
those interested in the unalloyed devotional service of the Lord. Srimad-
Bhagavatam therefore says:

dharmah projjhita-kaitavo ‘tra paramo nirmatsaranarin satam
vedyarin vastavam atra vastu Sivadarn tapa-trayonmalanam
$rimad-bhagavate maha-muni-krte kim va parair isvarah
sadyo hrdy avarudhyate ‘tra krtibhih susrasubhis tat-ksanat
“Completely rejecting all religious activities which are materially motivated, this
Bhagavata Purana propounds the highest truth, which is understandable by those
devotees who are pure in heart. The highest truth is reality distinguished from illu-
sion for the welfare of all. Such truth uproots the threefold miseries. This beautiful


--- Page 145 ---
142 $i Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 8
Bhagavatam, compiled by the great sage Sri Vyasadeva, is sufficient in itself for
Cod realization. As soon as one attentively and submissively hears the message of
Bhagavatam, he becomes attached to the Supreme Lord.” (Bhag. 1.1.2)

Those who aspire after liberation attempt to merge into the impersonal Brah-
man. To this end they execute ritualistic religious ceremonies, but Srimad-
Bhagavatam considers this a cheating process. Indeed, such people can never
dream of returning home, back to Godhead. There is a gulf of difference between
the goal of dharma, artha, kama and moksa and the goal of devotional service.

The goddess Durga is the superintending deity of this material world, which is
made of material elements. The demigods are simply different directors engaged
in operating the departments of material activities, and they are under the in-
fluence of the same material energy. Krsna's internal potencies, however, have
nothing to do with the creation of this cosmic material world. The spiritual world
and all spiritual activities are under the direction of the internal spiritual energy,
and such activities are performed by yogamaya, the spiritual energy. Yogamaya is
the spiritual or internal energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Those
who are interested in being promoted to the spiritual world and engaging in the
service of the Lord attain spiritual perfection under the control of yogamaya.
Those who are interested in material promotion engage in ritualistic religious
ceremonies and economic development to develop sense gratification. They
ultimately attempt to merge into the impersonal existence of the Lord. Such
people generally become impersonalists. They are interested in worshiping Lord
Siva or goddess Durga, but their return is one hundred percent materialistic.

Following the example of the gopis, the devotees sometimes worship the god-
dess Katyayani, but they understand that Katyayani is an incarnation of yogamaya.
The gopis worshiped Katyayani, yogamay4, to attain Krsna for their husband. On
the other hand, it is stated in the Sapta-sati scripture that a ksatriya king named
Suratha and a rich vaisya named Samadhi worshiped material nature in the form of
goddess Durga to attain material perfection. If one tries to mingle the worship of
yogamaya with mahamaya, considering them one and the same, he does not
really show very high intelligence. The idea that everything is one is a kind of
foolishness indulged in by those with less brain substance. Fools and rascals say
that the worship of yogamadya and mahamaya is the same. This conclusion is
simply the result of mental speculation, and it has no practical effect. In the ma-
terial world, sometimes one produces a title to an utterly worthless thing, and in
Bengal this is known as giving a blind child a name like Padmalocana, which means
“lotus eyed!” One may foolishly call a blind child Padmalocana, but such an ap-
pellation does not bear any meaning.

In the spiritual world the Absolute Lord is always identical with His name, fame,
form, qualities and pastimes. Such identity is impossible in the material world,
where the name of a person is different from the person himself. The Supreme
Lord has many holy names like Paramatma, Brahman and the creator, but one who


--- Page 146 ---
Text 91] Talks Between the Lord and Ramananda Raya 143
worships the Lord as the creator cannot understand the relationship between a
devotee and the Lord in the five types of transcendental mellows, nor can he
understand the conception of Krsna. One cannot understand the six transcenden-
tal opulences of the Lord simply by understanding the Supreme Personality of
Godhead as impersonal Brahman.

Impersonal realization of the Absolute Truth is certainly transcendental, but this
does not mean that one can understand the sac-cid-ananda form of the Lord.
Similarly, Paramatma realization is also an incomplete understanding of the Ab-
solute Truth. The plenary expansion of the Absolute Truth within everyone's
heart is the Paramatma feature of the Lord. A devotee of the Personality of God-
head Narayana cannot actually understand the transcendental attractive features
of Krsna. On the other hand, the devotee of Krsna who is attached to the sublime
attractive feature of the Lord does not consider Narayana very important. When
the gopis sometimes saw Krsna in the form of Narayana, they were not very at-
tracted to Him. The gopis never addressed Krsna as Rukmini-ramana. Krsna's
devotees in Vrndavana address Him 25 Radharamana, Nandanandana and Yasoda-
nandana, but not as Vasudeva-nandana or Devaki-nandana. Although according
to the material conception, Narayana, Rukmini-ramana and Krsna are one and the
same, in the spiritual world one cannot use the name of Krsna in the place of Ruk-
mini-ramana or Narayana. If one does so out of a poor fund of knowledge, his
mellow with the Lord becomes spiritually faulty and is called rasabhasa, an over-
lapping of transcendental mellows. The advanced devotee who has actually
realized the transcendental features of the Lord will not commit the mistake of
creating a rasabhasa situation by using one name for another. Because of the in-
fluence of Kali-yuga, there is much rasabhasa in the name of extravagance and
liberal-mindedness. Such fanaticism is not very much appreciated by pure devo-
tees.

perfectly. The next verse from Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.33.6) will illustrate this
verse.

disclosed here in the word aradhitah, from which the word Radha has come. Of
course, the name of Radharani is directly mentioned in other Puranas. This gopi’s
worship of Krsna is topmost, and therefore Her name is Radha, or the topmost
worshiper.

PURPORT

Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura explains that a mundane person, being
enriched by mundane opulences, must always know that the transcendental opu-
lences of the advanced devotees are far more important than the materialistic
opulences of a person like himself. A materialistic person with material opulences
should not be very proud or puffed up before a transcendental devotee. If one
approaches a transcendental devotee on the strength of his material heritage,
opulence, education and beauty and does not offer respect to the advanced
devotee of the Lord, the Vaisnava devotee may offer formal respects to such a
materially puffed-up person, but he may not deliver transcendental knowledge to
him. Indeed, the devotee sees him as a non-brahmana or sadra. Such a puffed-up

162 $ Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 8
person cannot understand the science of Krsna. A proud person is deceived in
transcendental life and despite attaining a human form will again glide into hellish
conditions. By His personal example, $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu explains how one
should be submissive and humble before a Vaisnava, even though one may be
situated on a high platform. Such is the teaching of ऽं Caitanya Mahaprabhu as
the adcarya of the world, the supreme spiritual master and teacher.

TRANSLATION

“Whether one is a braihmana, a sannyasi or a §iidra—regardless of what he

is—he can become a spiritual master if he knows the science of Krsna.”
PURPORT

This verse is very important to the Krsna consciousness movement. In his
Amrta-pravaha-bhasya, Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura explains that one should not
think that because ১11 Caitanya Mahaprabhu was born a brahmana and was situ-
ated in the topmost spiritual order as a sannydsi, it was improper for Him to
receive instructions from Srila Ramananda Raya, who belonged to the sadra caste.
To clarify this matter, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu informed Ramananda Raya that
knowledge of Krsna consciousness is more important than caste. In the system of
varnasrama-dharma there are various duties for the brahmanas, ksatriyas and
Sadras. Actually the brahmana is supposed to be the spiritual master of all other
varpas or sects, but as far as Krsna consciousness is concerned, everyone is ca-
pable of becoming a spiritual master because knowledge in Krsna consciousness is
on the platform of the spirit soul. To spread Krsna consciousness, one need only
be cognizant of the science of the spirit soul. It does not matter whether one is a
brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya, sadra, sannyasi, grhastha or whatever. If one simply
understands this science, he can become a spiritual master.


--- Page 166 ---
Text 128] Talks Between the Lord and Ramananda Raya 163

It is stated in the Hari-bhakti-vilasa that one should not accept initiation from a
person who is not in the brahminical order if there is a fit person in the brahminical
order present. This instruction is meant for those who are overly dependent on
the mundane social order and is suitable for those who want to remain in mun-
dane life. If one understands the truth of Krsna consciousness and seriously
desires to attain transcendental knowledge for the perfection of life, he can ac-
cept a spiritual master from any social status, provided the spiritual master is fully
conversant with the science of Krsna. Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura also
states that although one is situated as a brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya, 50412,
brahmacari, vanaprastha, grhastha or sannyasj, if he is conversant in the science of
Krsna he can become a spiritual master as vartma-pradarsaka-guru, diksa-guru or
Siksa-guru. One who first gives information about spiritual life is called the vartma-
pradarsaka-guru or spiritual master. The spiritual master who initiates according to
the regulations of the sastras is called diksa-guru, and the spiritual master who
gives instructions for elevation is called $iksa-guru. Factually the qualifications of a
spiritual master depend on his knowledge of the science of Krsna. It does not mat-
ter whether he is a brahmana, ksatriya, sannyasi or sadra. This injunction given by
ऽं Caitanya Mahaprabhu is not at all against the injunctions of the $astras. In the
Padma Purana it is said:

na sadrah bhagavad-bhaktas
te ‘pi bhagavatottamah
sarva-varpesu te sadra
ye na bhakta janardane

One who is actually advanced in spiritual knowledge of Krsna is never a sadra,
even though he may have been born in a sadra family. However, if a vipra or a
brahmana is very expert in the six brahminical activities (pathana, pathana, yajana,
yajana, dana, pratigraha) and is also well versed in the Vedic hymns, he cannot be-
come a spiritual master unless he is a Vaisnava. But if one is born in the family of
candalas yet is well versed in Krsna consciousness, he can become a guru. These
are the $astric injunctions, and strictly following these injunctions, Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu, as a grhastha named $ri Visvambhara, was initiated by a sannyasi-
guru named Tévara Puri. Similarly, $ri Nityananda Prabhu was initiated by Madha-
vendra Puri, a sannydsi. According to others, however, He was initiated by
Laksmipati Tirtha. Advaita Acarya, although a grhastha, was initiated by Madha-
vendra Puri, and $ri Rasikananda, although born in a brahmana family, was initiated
by Sri Syamananda Prabhu, who was not born in a caste brahmana family. There
are many instances in which a born brahmana took initiation from a person who
was not born in a brahmana family. The brahminical symptoms are explained in
$rimad-Bhagavatam (7.11.35), wherein it is stated:


--- Page 167 ---
164 $ri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 8
yasya yal-laksaparn proktam
(2417150 varpabhivyafjakam
yad anyatrapi drsyeta
tat tenaiva vinirdiset
If a person is born in a 0072 family but has all the qualities of a spiritual master, he
should be accepted not only as a brahmana but as a qualified spiritual master also.
This is also the instruction of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Srila Bhaktisiddhanta
Thakura therefore introduced the sacred thread ceremony for all Vaisnavas ac-
cording to the rules and regulations.

Sometimes a Vaisnava who is a bhajananandi does not take the savitra-
samiskara (sacred thread initiation), but this does not mean that this system should
be used for preaching work. There are two kinds of Vaisnavas — bhajananandiand
gosthyanandi. A bhajananandi is not interested in preaching work, but a gosthya-
nandfris interested in spreading Krsna consciousness to benefit the people and in-
crease the number of Vaisnavas. A Vaisnava is understood to be above the posi-
tion of a brahmana. As a preacher, he should be recognized as a brahmana; other-
wise there may be a misunderstanding of his position as a Vaisnava. However, a
Vaisnava brahmana is not selected on the basis of his birth but according to his
qualities. Unfortunately, those who are unintelligent do not know the difference
between a brahmana and a Vaisnava. They are under the impression that unless
one is a brahmana he cannot be a spiritual master. For this reason only, $i Caitanya
Mahaprabhu makes the statement in this verse:

kiba vipra, kiba nyasi, sadra kene naya
yei krspa-tattva-vetta, sei ‘guru’ haya

If one becomes a guru, he is automatically a brahmana. Sometimes a caste guru
says that ye krspa-tattva-vetta, sei guru haya means that one who is not a
brahmana may become a Siksa-guru or a vartma-pradarsaka-guru but not an initia-
tor guru. According to such caste gurus, birth and family ties are considered
foremost. However, the hereditary consideration is not acceptable to Vaisnavas.
The word guru is equally applicable to the vartma-pradarsaka-guru, siksa-guru and
diksa-guru. Unless we accept the principle enunciated by Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu, this Krsna consciousness movement cannot spread all over the
world. According to आ Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s intentions: prthivite dche yata
nagaradi-grama sarvatra pracara haibe mora nama. $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu's cult
must be preached all over the world. This does not mean that people should take
to His teachings and remain stadras or candalas. As soon as one is trained as a pure
Vaisnava, he must be accepted as a bona fide brahmana. This is the essence of Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu's instructions in this verse.

166 Sri Caitanya-caritaimrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 8
TRANSLATION

Sri Rimananda Raya was a great devotee of the Lord and a lover of God, and
although his mind could not be covered by Krsna’s illusory energy, and al-
though he could understand the mind of the Lord, which was very strong and
intense, Ramananda’s mind became a little agitated.

PURPORT

The perfect devotee always acts according to the desires of the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead. However, a materialistic man is carried away by the waves of
the material energy. Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura has said, mayara vase, yaccha
bhese, khaccha habudubu, bhai.

A person under the grip of the material energy is carried away by the waves of
that illusory energy. In other words, a person in the material world is a servant of
maya. However, a person in the spiritual energy is a servant of the Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead. Although Ramananda Raya knew that nothing was
unknown to 6 Caitanya Mahaprabhu, he nonetheless began to speak further on
the subject because the Lord desired it.

vidantas te santah ksiti-virala-carah katipaye


--- Page 173 ---
170 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 8
The spiritual realm of Vrndavana is always spiritual. The goddess of fortune and

the gopis are always present there. They are beloved by Krsna, and all of them are
equally spiritual like Krsna. In Vrndavana, Krsna is the Supreme Person and is the
husband of all the gopis and the goddess of fortune. The trees in Vrndavana are
wish-fulfilling trees. The land is made of touchstone, and the water is nectar.
Words are musical vibrations, and all movements are dancing. The flute is the
Lord's constant companion. The planet Goloka Vrndavana is self-luminous like the
sun and is full of spiritual bliss. The perfection of life lies in tasting that spiritual ex-
istence; therefore everyone should cultivate its knowledge. In Vrndavana,
spiritual cows are always supplying spiritual milk. Not a single moment is wasted
there—in other words, there is no past, present or future. Not a single particle of
time is wasted. Within this material universe, the devotees worship that transcen-
dental abode as Goloka Vrndavana. Lord Brahma himself said, “Let me worship
that spiritual land where Krsna is present!” This transcendental Vrndavana is not
appreciated by those who are not devotees or self-realized souls because this
Vrndavana-dhama is all spiritual. The pastimes of the Lord there are also spiritual.
None are material. According to the prayer of Srila Narottama dasa Thakura
(Prarthana 1):

ara kabe nitai-candera karuna haibe

sarhsara-vasana mora kabe tuccha ha’be.
“When will Lord Nitydananda have mercy upon me so that | can realize the
uselessness of material pleasure?”

visaya-chadiya kabe suddha ha’be mana
kabe hama heraba sri-vrndavana

“When will my mind be cleansed of all material dirt so that | will be able to feel
the presence of spiritual Vrndavana?”

rapa-raghunatha-pade haibe akuti

kabe hama bujhaba se yugala-piriti
“When will | be attracted to the instructions of the Gosvamis so that | will be able
to understand what is Radha and Krsna and what is Vrndavana?”

These verses indicate that one first has to be purified of all material desires and
all attraction for fruitive activity and speculative knowledge if one wishes to
understand Vrndavana.

In reference to the words aprakrta navina madana, “aprakrta” refers to that
which is the very opposite of the material conception. The Mayavadis consider
this to be zero or impersonal, but that is not the case. Everything in the material


--- Page 174 ---
Text 138] Talks Between the Lord and Raimananda Raya 171
world is dull, but in the spiritual world everything is alive. The desire for enjoy-
ment is present both in Krsna and in His parts and parcels, the living entities. In the
spiritual world, such desires are also spiritual. No one should mistakenly consider
such desires to be material. In the material world, if one is sexually inclined and
enjoys sex life, he enjoys something temporary. His enjoyment vanishes after a
few minutes. However, in the spiritual world the same enjoyment may be there,
but it never vanishes. It is continually enjoyed. In the spiritual world such sex
desire appears to the enjoyer to be more and more relishable with each new
feature. In the material world, however, sex enjoyment becomes distasteful after a
few minutes only, and it is never permanent. Because Krsna appears very much
sexually inclined, He is called the new Cupid in the spiritual world. There is no ma-
terial inebriety in such desire, however.

Cayantarn trdyate yasmat gayatri tvam tatah smrta: if one chants the gayatri-
mantra, he is gradually delivered from the material clutches. That which delivers
one from material entanglement is called gayatri. An explanation of the gayatri-
mantra can be found in Madhya-lila, Chapter Twenty-one, text 125:

kama-gayatri-mantra-rapa, haya krsnera svardpa,
sardha-cabisa aksara tara haya
se aksara ‘candra’ haya, krsne kari’ udaya,
trijagat kaila kama-maya

This mantra is just like a Vedic hymn, but it is the Supreme Personality of God-
head Himself. There is no difference between the kama-gayatri and Krsna. Both
are composed of twenty-four and a half transcendental letters. The mantra
depicted in letters is also Krsna, and the mantra rises just like the moon. Due to
this, there is a perverted reflection of desire in human society and among all kinds
of living entities. In the mantra: klim kama-devaya vidmahe puspa-banaya
dhimahi tan no ‘nangah pracodayat, Krsna is called Kama-deva or Madana-
mohana, the Deity who establishes our relationship with Krsna. Govinda, or
puspa-bana, who carries an arrow made of flowers, is the Personality of Godhead
who accepts our devotional service. Anariga, or Gopijana-vallabha, satisfies all the
gopis and is the ultimate goal of life. This kama-gayatri (klim kama-devaya vid-
mahe puspa-banaya dhimahi tan no ‘narigah pracodayat) simply does not belong
to this material world. When one is advanced in spiritual understanding, he can
worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead with his spiritually purified senses
and fulfill the desires of the Lord.

“Always think of Me and become My devotee. Worship Me and offer your

cause you are My very dear friend!” (Bg. 18.65)

“Then Gayatri, mother of the Vedas, having been manifested by the divine sound
of Sri Krsna's flute, entered the lotus mouth of Brahma, the self-born, through his
eight earholes. The lotus-born Brahma received the gayatri-mantra, which had
sprung from the song of Sri Krsna's flute. Thus he attained twice-born status, hav-
ing been initiated by the supreme primal preceptor, Godhead Himself. Enlightened
by the recollection of that gayatri, which embodies the three Vedas, Brahma be-
came acquainted with the expanse of the ocean of truth. Then he worshiped ऽ
Krsna, the essence of all the Vedas, with a hymn!”

The vibration of Krsna's flute is the origin of the Vedic hymns. Lord Brahma,
who is seated on a lotus flower, heard the sound vibration of Krsna's flute and was
thereby initiated by the gayatri-mantra.

TRANSLATION

“The very name Krsna means that He attracts even Cupid. He is therefore
attractive to everyone—male and female, moving and inert living entities. In-
deed, Krsna is known as the all-attractive one.

PURPORT
Just as there are many orbs in the material world called stars or planets, in the
spiritual world there are many spiritual planets called Vaikunthalokas. The spiritual
universe, however, is situated far, far away from the cluster of material universes.
Material scientists cannot even estimate the number of planets and stars within
this universe. They are also incapable of traveling to other stars by spaceships. Ac-
cording to Bhagavad-git, there is also a spiritual world:
paras tasmat tu bhavo ‘nyo
‘vyakto ‘vyaktat sanatanah
yah sa sarvesu bhatesu
nasyatsu na vinasyati
“Yet there is another nature, which is eternal and is transcendental to this
manifested and unmanifested matter. It is supreme and is never annihilated. When
all in this world is annihilated, that part remains as it 15." (Bg. 8.20)

Thus there is another nature, which is superior to material nature. The word
bhava or svabhava refers to nature. The spiritual nature is eternal, and even when
all the material universes are destroyed, the planets in the spiritual world abide.
They remain exactly as the spirit soul remains even after the annihilation of the
material body. That spiritual world is called aprakrta, or the anti-material world. In
this transcendental spiritual world or universe, the highest planetary system is
known as Goloka Vrndavana. That is the abode of Lord Krsna Himself, who is also
all-spiritual. Krsna is known there as Aprakrta-madana The name Madana refers to
Cupid, but Krsna is the spiritual Madana. His body is not material like the body of
Cupid in this material universe. Krsna's body is all-spiritual —sac-cid-ananda-
vigraha. Therefore He is called Aprakrta-madana. He is also known as Manmatha-
madana, which means that He is attractive even to Cupid. Sometimes Krsna's ac-
tivities and attractive features are misinterpreted by gross materialists who accuse
Him of being immoral because He danced with the gopis, but such an accusation
results from not knowing that Krsna is beyond this material world. His body is sac-
cid-ananda-vigraha, completely spiritual. There is no material contamination in His
body, and one should not consider His body a lump of flesh and bones. The
Mayavadi philosophers conceive of Krsna’s body as material, and this is an abomi-
nable, gross, materialistic conception. Just as Krsna is completely spiritual, the
gopis are also spiritual, and this is confirmed in Brahma-sarmhita (5.37):


--- Page 177 ---
174 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 8
ananda-cin-maya-rasa-pratibhavitabhis
tabhir ya eva nija-rapataya kalabhih
goloka eva nivasaty akhilatma-bhato
govindam adi-purusarn tam aham bhajami
“I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord. He resides in His own realm, Goloka, with
Radha, who resembles His own spiritual figure and who embodies the ecstatic
potency [hladini]. Their companions are Her confidantes, who embody exten-
sions of Her bodily form and who are imbued and permeated with ever-blissful
spiritual rasa!’

The gopis are also of the same spiritual quality (nija-rdpataya) because they are
expansions of Krsna's pleasure potency. Neither Krsna nor the gopis have anything
to do with lumps of matter or the material conception. In the material world, the
living entity is encaged within a material body, and due to ignorance he thinks
that he is the body. Lusty desire, enjoyment between male and female, is all mate-
rial. One cannot compare the lusty desires of a materialistic man to the lusty
desires of Krsna. Unless one is advanced in spiritual science, he cannot understand
the lusty desires between Krsna and the gopis. In Caitanya-caritamrta the lusty
desire of the gopis is compared to gold. The lusty desires of a materialistic man, on
the other hand, are compared to iron. At no stage can iron and gold be compared.
The living entities—moving and nonmoving —are part and parcel of Krsna;
therefore they originally have the same kind of lusty desire. However, when this
lusty desire is expressed through matter, it is abominable. When a living entity is
spiritually advanced and liberated from material bondage, he can understand
Krsna in truth. As stated in Bhagavad-gita:

janma karma ca me divyam
evarn yo vetti tattvatah
tyaktva deharh punar janma
naiti mam eti so ‘rjuna
“One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does
not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains
My eternal abode, O Arjuna.” (Bg. 4.9)

When one can understand the body of Krsna as well as the Lord's lusty desires,
one is immediately liberated. A conditioned soul encaged within the material
body cannot understand Krsna. As stated in Bhagavad-gita:

manusyanar sahasresu
kascid yatati siddhaye

yatatam api siddhanam
kascin marn vetti tattvatah


--- Page 178 ---
Text 139] Talks Between the Lord and Ramananda Raya 175
“Out of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection, and of
those who have achieved perfection, hardly one knows Me in truth.” (Bg. 7.3)

The word siddhaye indicates liberation. Only after being liberated from material
conditioning can one understand Krsna. When one can understand Krsna as He is
(tattvatah), one actually lives in the spiritual world, although apparently living
within the material body. This technical science can be understood when one is
actually spiritually advanced.

In his Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu (1.2.187), Srila Ripa Gosvami says:

iha yasya harer dasye
karmana manasa gira
nikhilasv apy avasthasu
jivan-muktah sa ucyate
When a person in this material world desires only to serve Krsna with love and
devotion, he is liberated, even though functioning within this material world. As
Bhagavad-gita confirms:
mam ca yo ’vyabhicarena
bhakti-yogena sevate
sa gunan samatityaitan
brahma-bhayaya kalpate
“One who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any
circumstance, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to
the level of Brahman.” (Bg. 14.26)

Simply by engaging in the loving service of the Lord one can attain liberation.
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (18.54): brahma-bhatah prasannatma na socati na
kanksati. A person who is highly advanced in spiritual knowledge and who has at-
tained the brahma-bhata stage neither laments nor hankers for anything material.
That is the stage of spiritual realization.

Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura considered the brahma-bhata stage in two divi-
sions — svaripa-gata and vastu-gata. When one has understood Krsna in truth but
is still maintaining some material connection, he is known to be situated in his
svardpa, his original consciousness. When that original consciousness is com-
pletely spiritual, it is called Krsna consciousness. One who lives in such conscious-
ness is actually living in Vrndavana. He may live anywhere; material location
doesn’t matter. When by the grace of Krsna one thus advances, he becomes com-
pletely uncontaminated by the material body and mind and at that time factually
lives in Vrndavana. That stage is called vastu-gata.

One should execute his spiritual activities in the svaripa-gata stage of con-
sciousness. He should also chant the cinmayi gayatri, the spiritual mantras: orm


--- Page 179 ---
176 Sri Caitanya-caritaimrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 8
namo bhagavate vasudevaya, or klim krsnadya govindaya gopijana-vallabhaya
svaha. Klim kamadevaya vidmahe puspa-banaya dhimahi tan no ’‘nangah pra-
codayat. These are the kama-gayatri or kama-bija mantras. One should be ini-
tiated by a bona fide spiritual master and worship Krsna with these transcendental
mantras known as kama-gayatri or kama-bija.

As explained by Krsnadasa Kavirdja Cosvami:

vrndavane ‘aprakrta navina madana’
kama-gayatri kama-bije yanra upasana
purusa, yosit, kiba sthavara-jarigama
sarva-cittakarsaka, saksat manmatha-madana
(Cc. Madhya 8.138-139)

A person who is properly purified and initiated by the spiritual master worships
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, by this mantra. He chants the kama-
gayatri with the kama-bija. As Bhagavad-gita confirms, one should engage in tran-
scendental worship in order to be fit for being attracted by Krsna, the all-
attractive.

man-mana bhava mad-bhakto
mad-yaji mam namaskuru
mam evaisyasi satyam te
pratijane priyo ‘si me
“Always think of Me and become My devotee. Worship Me and offer your
homage unto Me. Thus you will come to Me without fail. | promise you this be-
cause you are My very dear friend.” (Bg. 18.65)

Since every living entity is part and parcel of Krsna, Krsna is naturally attractive.
Due to material covering, one’s attraction for Krsna is checked. One is not usually
attracted by Krsna in the material world, but as soon as one is liberated from ma-
terial conditioning, he is naturally attracted. Therefore it is said in this verse, sarva-
cittakarsaka. Everyone is naturally attracted by Krsna. This attraction is within
everyone's heart, and when the heart is cleansed, attraction is manifest (ceto-dar-
pana-marjanar bhava-maha-davagni-nirvapanam).

Krsna. Krsna is the most attractive feature for every kind of devotee. He is
therefore called akhila-rasamrta-marti, the transcendental form of attraction for all
kinds of devotees, whether the devotee be in the santa-rasa, dasya-rasa, sakhya-
rasa, madhurya-rasa or vatsalya-rasa. |
This is the opening verse of Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu by Srila Ripa Gosvami.

PURPORT

This is a quotation from S$rimad-Bhagavatam (10.89.58) concerning Krsna's en-
deavor to take Arjuna beyond the material universe when Arjuna was searching
for the sons of a brahmana.

Lord Maha-Visnu, who is situated beyond this material world, was also at-
tracted by the bodily features of Krsna. Maha-Visnu had actually stolen the sons
of the brahmana in Dvaraka so that Krsna and Arjuna would come visit Him. This
verse is quoted to show that Krsna is so attractive that He attracts Maha-Visnu.

TRANSLATION

“$rimati Radharani’s transcendental body is brilliant in luster and full of all
transcendental flavors. Lord Krsna’'s affection for Her is like a perfumed
massage.

PURPORT

Sugandhi udvartana refers to a paste made of several perfumes and flavored
oils. This paste is massaged all over the body, and in this way the body's dirt and
perspiration are removed. Srimati Radharani’s body is automatically perfumed, but
when Her body is massaged with the scented paste of Lord Krsna's affection, Her
entire body is doubly perfumed and made brilliant and lustrous. This is the begin-
ning of Krsnadasa Kavirdja Gosvami's description of Srimati Radharani’s transcen-
dental body. This description is based on the book known as Premambhoja-
maranda compiled by Sri Raghunatha dasa Gosvami. Srila Kaviraja Gosvami's de-
scriptions in verses 165-181 are based on this book. A translation of the original
Sanskrit as described by Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura reads as follows:

“The love of the gopis for Krsna is full of transcendental ecstasy. It appears to be
a brilliant jewel, and enlightened by such a transcendental jewel, Radharani’s body
is further perfumed and decorated with kurkuma. In the morning Her body is
bathed in the nectar of compassion, in the afternoon in the nectar of youth, and in
the evening in the nectar of luster itself. In this way the bathing is performed, and
Her body becomes as brilliant as the cintamani jewel. Her dress is composed of
various kinds of silken garments, which may be compared to Her natural shyness.


--- Page 195 ---
192 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 8
Her beauty is more and more enhanced, being decorated with kurikuma, which is
compared to beauty itself, and with blackish musk, which is compared to conjugal
love. Thus Her body is decorated with different colors. The kurikuma is red, and
the musk is black. Her ornaments embody the natural symptoms of ecstasy —
trembling, tears, jubilation, stunning, perspiration, faltering of the voice, bodily
redness, madness and dullness. In this way the entire body is bedecked with these
nine different jewels. Over and above this, the beauty of Her body is enhanced by
Her transcendental qualities, which hang as a flower garland on Her body. The
ecstasy of love for Krsna is known as dhira and adhirg, sober and restless. Such
ecstasy constitutes the covering of Srimati Radharani’s body, and it is adorned by
camphor. Her transcendental anger toward Krsna is embodied as the arrangement
of the hair on Her head, and the tilaka of Her great fortune shines on Her beautiful
forehead. The earrings of Srimati Radharani are the holy names of Krsna, as well as
the hearing of His name and fame. Her lips are always reddish due to the betel nut
of ecstatic affection for Krsna. The black ointment around Her eyes is Her tricky
behavior with Krsna brought about by love. Her joking with Krsna and gentle smil-
ing is the camphor with which She is perfumed. She sleeps in Her room with the
aroma of pride, and when She lies down in Her bed, the transcendental variety of
Her loving ecstasies is like a jeweled locket in the midst of Her necklace of separa-
tion. Her transcendental breasts are covered by Her sari in the form of affection
and anger toward Krsna. She has a stringed instrument known as a kacchapi-ving,
which is the fame and fortune that actually dries up the faces and breasts of the
other gopis. She always keeps Her hands on the shoulder of Her gopr friend, who
is compared to Her youthful beauty, and although She is highly qualified with so
many spiritual assets, She is nonetheless affected by the Cupid known as Krsna.
Thus She is defeated. Srila Raghunatha dasa Gosvami offers his respectful obei-
sances to Srimati Radharani, taking a straw in his mouth. Indeed, he prays, "০
Gandharvika, Srimati Radharani, just as Lord Krsna never rejects a surrendered soul,
please don't reject me!” This is a summary translation of the Premambhoja-
maranda which Kaviraja Gosvami quotes.

“$rimati Radharani takes Her first bath in the shower of the nectar of com-
passion, and She takes Her second bath in the nectar of youth.
PURPORT
Srimati Radharani first smears Her body with the paste of affection for Krsna.
She then takes Her bath in the water of mercy. After passing the pauganda age
(from five to ten years), Srimati Radharant first appears as mercy. The second bath,
taken at noon, is taken in the water of tarunyamrta, or the nectar of youth. This is
the actual expression of Her new youthfulness.

Over and above the other baths, the bath taken in the afternoon is taken in the
nectar of full beauty. This nectar represents the personal qualities of beauty and
luster. Thus there are three baths in different kinds of water. Radharani then puts
on two dresses —a lower and upper dress. The upper dress is Her attachment for
Krsna, and the lower dress is Her shyness. That lower portion is compared to a
blackish silk garment or a bluish sari, and Her upper garment is pinkish. That pink
garment is Her affection and attraction for Krsna.

Text 177] Talks Between the Lord and Ramananda Raya 197
PURPORT

The twenty different moods headed by kila-kiricita are described as follows.
First, in connection with the body, there are bhava (ecstasy), hava (gestures) and
hela (negligence); in relation to the self there are sobha (beauty), kanti (luster),
dipti (brilliance), madhurya (sweetness), pragalbhata (impudence), audarya (mag-
nanimity) and dhairya (patience); and in relation to nature, there are lila
(pastimes), vilasa (enjoyment), vicchitti (breaking off) and vibhrama (puzzlement).
There are no English equivalents for the words kila-kiricita, mottayita and kut-
tamita.

A flower garland constitutes the qualities of গাও Radharani and is divided
into mental, verbal and bodily parts. Her attitude of forgiveness and mercy is all
mental. Her talks, which are very pleasing to the ear, are verbal. The physical
qualities—age, beauty, luster and grace —are bodily qualities.

is very curly, Her two eyes are always moving to and fro, and Her breasts are
firm. Since all transcendental qualities are manifest in Srimati Radharani, She
alone is able to fulfill all the desires of Krsna. No one else.

Raya Ramananda replied, ‘Lord Krsna is dhira-lalita, for He can always keep
His girl friends in a subjugated state. Thus His only business is in enjoying
sense gratification.
PURPORT
We should always remember that Krsna's sense gratification is never to be
compared to the sense gratification of the material world. As we have already ex-
plained, Krsna's sense gratification is just like gold. The perverted reflection of that
sense gratification found in the material world is just like iron. The purport is that
Krsna is not impersonal. He has all the desires that are manifest in the perverted
reflection within this material world. However, the qualities are different—one is
spiritual, and the other is material. Just as there is a difference between life and
death, there is a difference between spiritual sense gratification and material
sense gratification.

vinoda Thakura in his Amrta-pravaha-bhasya. In essence, Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu told Ramaranda Raya, “My dear Ramananda, the explanation you
have given about the goal of life and the pastimes of $rimati Radharani and Krsna
is certainly the truth. Although this is factual, you can continue telling Me more if
there is anything more to say.” In reply, Ramananda Raya said, “I do not think |
have anything to say beyond this, but there is a topic known as prema-vilasa-
vivarta, which | may explain to You. | do not know whether it will bring You happi-
ness or not.”

The topics that are about to be discussed between tord $ri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu and Ramananda Raya cannot be understood by a materialistic poet,
nor by intelligence or material perception. $rila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura
states that the spiritual mellow can be realized only when one is situated on the
transcendental platform beyond the material stage of goodness. That platform is
called visuddha-sattva (sattvarn visuddhari vasudeva-sabditam). Realization of the
visuddha-sattva is beyond the pale of the material world and is not perceived by

bodily senses or mental speculation. Our identification with the gross body and
subtle mind is different from spiritual understanding. Since the intelligence and
mind are material, the loving affairs of $ri Radha and Krsna are beyond their per-
ception. (sarvopadhi-vinirmuktari tat-paratvena nirmalam): when we are free
from all material designations and our senses are completely purified by the bhak-
ti process, we can understand the sense activities of the Absolute Truth (hrsikena
hrsikesa-sevanarh bhaktir ucyate).

The spiritual senses are beyond the material senses. A materialist can think only
of the negation of material variety; he cannot understand spiritual variety. He
thinks that spiritual variety simply contradicts material variety and is a negation or
void, but such conceptions cannot even reach the precincts of spiritual realiza-
tion. The wonderful activities of the gross body and subtle mind are always imper-
fect. They are below the degree of spiritual understanding and are ephemeral. The
spiritual mellow is eternally wonderful and is described as 20103, suddha, nitya-
mukta—that is completely purified and eternally liberated from all material con-
ceptions. When we are unable to fulfill our material desires, there is certainly sor-
row and confusion. This may be described as vivarta. However, in spiritual life
there is no sorrow, inebriety or imperfection. Srila Ramananda Raya was expert in
realizing the spiritual activities of Srimati Radharant and Krsna, and Ramananda’s
spiritual experience was placed before গা Caitanya Mahaprabhu as he inquired
whether the Lord approved his realization of spiritual truth.

There are three books prominent in this connection. One was written by Bhak-
ta dasa Baula and is called Vivarta-vilasa. Another was compiled by Jagadananda
and is called Prema-vivarta. Sri Ramananda २३५२५ book is called Prema-vilasa-
vivarta. The Vivarta-vilasa by Bhakta dasa Baula is completely different from the
other two books. Sometimes a university student or professor tries to study these
transcendental literatures and attempts to put forth a critical analysis from the
mundane view, with an end to receiving degrees like a Ph. D. Such realization is
certainly different from that of Ramananda Raya. If one actually wants to take a
Ph. D. degree from आ Caitanya Mahaprabhu and be approved by Ramananda
Raya, he must first become free from all material designations (sarvopadhi-vinir-
muktan tat-paratvena nirmalam). A person who identifies with his material body
cannot understand these talks between Sri Ramananda Raya and Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu. Man-made religious scriptures and transcendental philosophical
talks are quite different. Indeed, there is a gulf of difference between the two. This
subject matter has been very diligently described by Sriman Madhvacarya. Since
material philosophers are situated in the material prema of vildsa-vivarta, they are
unable to realize the spiritual prema-vilasa-vivarta. They cannot accommodate an
elephant upon a dish. Similarly, mundane speculators cannot capture the spiritual
elephant within their limited conception. it is just like a frog's trying to measure
the Atlantic Ocean by imagining it so many times larger than his well. Materialistic
philosophers and sahajiyas cannot understand the talks between Ramananda

Raya and Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu concerning the pastimes of Sri Radha and
Krsna. The only tendency of the impersonalists or the prakrta-sahajiyas is to face
the platform of impersonalism. They cannot understand the spiritual. Conse-
quently, when Ramananda Raya attempted to sing his own verses, $f Caitanya
Mahaprabhu stopped him by covering his mouth with His own hand.

^“ ‘Alas, before We met there was an initial attachment between Us brought
about by an exchange of glances. In this way attachment evclved. That attach-
ment has gradually begun to grow, and there is no limit to it. Now, that attach-
ment has become a natural sequence between Ourselves. It is not that it is due
to Krsna, the enjoyer, nor is it due to Me, for | am the enjoyed. it is not like
that. This attachment was made possible by mutual meeting. This mutual ex-
change of attraction is known as manobhava, or Cupid. Krsna’s mind and My
mind have merged together. Now, during this time of separation, it is very dif-
ficult to explain these loving affairs. My dear friend, Krsna might have forgot-
ten all these things. However, you can understand and bring this message to
Him, but during Our first meeting there was no messenger between Us, nor
did | request anyone to see Him. Indeed, Cupid’s five arrows were Our via
media. Now, during this separation, that attraction has increased to another
ecstatic state. My dear friend, please act as a messenger on My behalf because
if one is in love with a beautiful person, this is the consequence.”

PURPORT

These verses were originally composed and sung by Ramananda Raya hirnself
Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura suggests that during the time of enjoyment, the attach-
ment might be compared to Cupid himself. However, during the period of separa-
tion, Cupid becomes a messenger of highly elevated love. This is calied prema-
vilasa-vivarta. When there is a separation, enjoyment itself acts like a messenger,
and that messenger was addressed by ऽवत Radharant as a friend. The essence
of this transaction is simple: loving affairs are as relishable during separation as
during enjoyment. When Srimati Radharant was fully absorbed in love of Krsna,
She mistook a black tamala tree for Krsna and embraced it. Such a mistake is called
prema-vivarta-vilasa.

Srila Sanatana Gosvami has advised us to hear about Krsna from a Vaisnava. He
has explicitly forbidden us to hear from an avaisnava.
avaisnava-mukhodgirnarm
patari hari-kathamrtam
Sravaparh naiva kartavyari
sarpocchistari yatha payah
Thus quoting from Padma Purana, Srila Sanatana Gosvami warns that one should
not hear anything about Krsna from an avaispava, however great a mundane
scholar he may be. Milk touched by the lips of a serpent has poisonous effects;
similarly, talks about Krsna given by an avaisnava are also poisonous. However, be-
cause a Vaisnava is surrendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his talks
are spiritually potent. In Bhagavad-gita the Supreme Lord says,
tesam satata-yuktanarm
bhajatam priti-parvakam
dadami buddhi-yogari tam
yena mam upayanti te
“To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, | give the
understanding by which they can come to Me! (Bg. 10.10) When a pure
Vaisnava speaks, he speaks perfectly. How is 0715? His speech is managed by Krsna
Himself from within the heart. Srila Rimananda Raya accepts this benediction
from ऽ Caitanya Mahaprabhu; therefore he admits that whatever he was speak-
ing was not derived from his own intelligence. Rather, everything was coming
from Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. According to Bhagavad-gita:
sarvasya cahari hrdi sannivisto
mattah smrtir jianam apohanarn ca
vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyo
vedanta-krd veda-vid eva caham
“I am seated in everyone's heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge
and forgetfulness. By all the Vedas | am to be known; indeed | am the compiler of
Vedanta, and | am the knower of the Vedas!” (Bg. 15.15)

All intelligence emanates from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Super-
soul within the heart of everyone. Nondevotees want to ask the Supreme Lord for
sense gratification; therefore nondevotees come under the influence of maya, the
illusory energy. A devotee, however, is directed by the Supreme Personality of

Codhead and comes under the influence of yogamaya. Consequently there is a
gulf of difference between statements made by a devotee and those made by a
nondevotee.

PURPORT
The means for returning home, for going back to Godhead, is devotional ser-
vice, but everyone has a different taste in the Lord's service. One may be inclined
to serve the Lord in servitude (dasya-rasa), fraternity (sakhya-rasa), or paternal
love (vatsalya-rasa), but all these cannot enable one to enter into the service of
the Lord in conjugal love. To attain such service, one has to follow in the footsteps
of the gopis in the ecstasy of sakhi-bhava. Then only can one understand the
transcendental mellow of conjugal love.
In the Ujjvala-nilamani, $rila Ripa Gosvami advises:
prema-lila-viharanarm
samyag vistarika sakhi
visrambha-ratna-peti ca
One who expands the conjugal love of Krsna and His enjoyment among the
gopis is called a sakhi. Such a person is a confidential gopi in the conjugal affairs.
Such assistants are like jewels in the form of Krsna’s confidence. The actual busi-
ness of the sakhis is described thus in Ujjvala-nilamani:
mithah prema-gunotkirtis
tayor asakti-karita
abhisaro dvayor eva
sakhyah krsne samarpanam
narmasvasana-nepathyarn
hrdayodghata-patavam
chidra-sarvrtir etasyah
paty-adeh parivaficana
Siksa sangamanam kale
sevanam vyajanadibhih
tayor dvayor upalambhah
sandesa-presanam tatha
nayika-prana-sarraksa
prayatnadyah sakhi-kriyah
In the conjugal pastimes of Krsna, Krsna is the hero (nayaka), and Radhika is the
heroine (nayika). The first business of the gopis is to chant the glories of both the
hero and the heroine. Their second business is to create gradually a situation in
which the hero may be attracted to the heroine and vice versa. Their third busi-


--- Page 220 ---
Text 206] Talks Between the Lord and Ramananda Raya 217
ness is to induce both of Them to approach one another. Their fourth business is
to surrender unto Krsna, the fifth is to create a jovial atmosphere, the sixth to give
Them assurance to enjoy Their pastimes, the seventh to dress and decorate both
hero and heroine, the eighth to show expertise in expressing Their desires, the
ninth to conceal the faults of the heroine, the tenth to cheat their respective hus-
bands and relatives, the eleventh to educate, the twelfth to enable both hero and
heroine to meet at the proper time, the thirteenth to fan both hero and heroine,
the fourteenth to sometimes reproach the hero and heroine, the fifteenth to set
conversations in motion, and the sixteenth to protect the heroine by various
means.

Some material sahajiyas who cannot actually understand the pastimes of Radha
and Krsna manufacture their own life-styles without referring to authority. Such
sahajiyas are called sakhi-bheki, and sometimes they are called gaura-nagari. They
believe that the material body, which is fit to be eaten by jackals and dogs, is en-
joyable for Krsna. Consequently they artificially decorate the material body to at-
tract Krsna, thinking themselves sakhis. However, Krsna is never attracted by the
artificial grooming of the material body. As far as Srimati Radharani and Her gopis
are concerned, their bodies, homes, dresses, ornaments, endeavors and activities
are all spiritual. All of these are meant to satisfy the spiritual senses of Krsna. In-
deed, they are so pleasing and endearing to Krsna that He is subjugated by the in-
fluence of Srimati Radharani and Her friends. They have nothing to do with any-
thing mundane within the fourteen planetary systems of the universe. Although
Krsna is attractive to everyone, He is nonetheless attracted by the gopis and
Srimati Radharani.

One should not be misled by mental concoctions, supposing his material
body to be perfect and deeming oneself a sakhi. This is something like
ahangrahopasana, that is, a Mayavadi's worship of his own body as the Supreme.
Srila Jiva Gosvami has cautioned mundaners to abstain from such conceptions. He
also warns that thinking oneself one of the associates of the Supreme without
following in the footsteps of the gopis is as offensive as thinking oneself the
Supreme. Such thinking is an aparadha. One has to practice living in Vindavana by
hearing about the talks of the gopis with Krsna. However, one should not consider
himself a gopi, for this is offensive.

In his Amrta-pravaha-bhasya, Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura states: “Srimati
Radharani is the creeper of love of Godhead, and the gopis are exactly like twigs,
flowers and leaves. When water is sprinkled on the creeper, the twigs, flowers and
leaves indirectly receive all the benefits of the creeper itself. However, water
sprinkled directly on the twigs, leaves and flowers is not as effective as water
sprinkled on the creeper’s root. The gopis are not as pleased when they directly
mix with Krsna as when they serve to unite Srimati Radharani with Krsna. Their
transcendental pleasure lies in uniting Them.”

Srimati Radharani and the gopis are not interested in their personal happiness
derived from association with Krsna. Rather, they become happy by seeing one
another associate with Krsna. In this way their dealings are further nourished by
love of Godhead, and seeing this, Krsna is very pleased.

TRANSLATION
“It is to be noted that the natural characteristic of the gopis is to love the
Supreme Lord. Their lusty desire is not to be compared to material lust. None-
theless, because their desire sometimes appears to resemble material lust,
their transcendental love for Krsna is sometimes described as lust.
PURPORT
Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura says that material lust should never be at-
tributed to Krsna, who is full of transcendental knowledge. Material lust cannot be
engaged in the service of the Lord, for it is applicable to materialists, not to Krsna.
Only prema, or love of Godhead, is applicable for the satisfaction of Krsna. Prema
is full service rendered unto the Lord. The lusty affairs of the gopis actually con-
stitute the topmost love of Godhead because the gopis never act for their own
personal satisfaction. They are simply pleased by engaging other gopis in the ser-
vice of the Lord. The gopis derive more transcendental pleasure from indirectly
engaging other gopis in the service of Krsna than from engaging in His service
themselves. That is the difference between material lust and love of Godhead.
Lust applies to the material world, and love of Godhead applies only to Krsna.

TRANSLATION

“If one worships the Lord on the path of spontaneous love and goes to
Vrndavana, he receives the shelter of Vrajendra-nandana, the son of Nanda
Maharaja.

PURPORT

In all, there are sixty-four items listed for the rendering of service unto Krsna,
and these are the the regulative principles enjoined in the $astras and given by the
spiritual master. One has to serve Krsna according to these regulative principles,
but if one develops spontaneous love for Krsna as exhibited in the activities of
those who live in Vrajabhimi, one attains the platform of raganuga-bhakti. One
who has developed this spontaneous love is eligible for elevation to the platform
enjoyed by the inhabitants of Vrajabhami. In Vrajabhami, there are no regulative
principles set forth for Krsna’s service. Rather, everything is carried out in spon-
taneous, natural love for Krsna. There is no question of following the principles of
the Vedic system. Such principles are followed within this material world, and as
long as one is on the material platform, he has to execute them. However, spon-
taneous love of Krsna is transcendental. It may seem that the regulative principles
are being violated, but the devotee is on the transcendental platform. Such ser-
vice is called gunatita, or nirguna, for it is not contaminated by the three modes of
material nature.

TRANSLATION
“Those saintly persons who presented the Upanisads are vivid examples of
this. By worshiping the Lord on the path of spontaneous love, they attained
the lotus feet of Vrajendra-nandana, the son of Nanda Maharaja.
PURPORT
In the Goloka Vrndavana planet, Krsna's servants are headed by Raktaka and
Patraka. Krsna's friends are headed by Sridama, Subala and others. There are also
elderly gopis and the cowherd men headed by Nanda Maharaja, mother Yasoda
and others. All of these personalities are eternally engaged in the loving service of
the Lord in accordance with their specific attachments for Krsna. One who wants
to return home to serve the Lord directly is attracted to Krsna as a servant, friend,
father or mother. By continuously serving Krsna during this life in a particular
ecstasy, one gives up the material body and attains a suitable spiritual body to
serve Krsna in terms of a particular attachment. One may serve as a servant,
friend, father or mother. In the same way, if one wants to serve Krsna in conjugal
love, he can also attain a body under the guidance of the gopis. The most vivid
example in this connection is those saintly personalities known as srutis, who pre-
sented the Upanisads. These srutis understand that without serving Krsna and
following in the footsteps of the gopis, there is no possibility of entering the
kingdom of God. Therefore they engage in spontaneous loving service unto Krsna
and follow in the footsteps of the gopis.

they saw the Supersoul within their hearts and ultimately entered into the im-

Godhead attain that position simply by thinking of the Supreme Lord. The
damsels of Vraja, the gopis, simply wanted to embrace Krsna and hold His
arms, which are like serpents. Being attracted by the beauty of Krsna, they
ultimately acquired a taste for the nectar of the Lord's lotus feet. We can also
taste the nectar of Krsna’s lotus feet by following in the footsteps of the gopis.

to the spiritual world. There the devotee attains an opportunity to serve Radha
and Krsna as one of the gopis.

PURPORT

Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura comments that the word siddha-deha,
“perfected spiritual body,” refers to a body beyond the material gross body com-
posed of five elements and the subtle astral body composed of mind, intelligence
and false ego. In other words, one attains a completely spiritual body fit to render
service to the transcendental couple Radha and Krsna: sarvopadhi-vinirmuktarn
tat-paratvena nirmalam.

When one is situated in his spiritual body, which is beyond this gross and subtle
material body, he is fit to serve Radha and Krsna. That body is called siddha-deha.
The living entity attains a particular type of gross body in accordance with his past
activities and mental condition. In this life the mental condition changes in dif-
ferent ways, and the same living entity gets another body in the next life accord-
ing to his desires. The mind, intelligence and false ego are always engaged in an
attempt to dominate material nature. According to that subtle astral body, one at-
tains a gross body to enjoy the objects of one’s desires. According to the activities
of the present body, one prepares another subtle body. And according to the
subtle body, one attains another gross body. This is the process of material exis-
tence. However, when one is spiritually situated and does not desire a gross or
subtle body, he attains his original spiritual body. As confirmed by Bhagavad-gita
(4.9): tyaktva dehari punar janma naiti mam eti so ‘rjuna.

One is elevated to the spiritual world by the spiritual body and is situated either
in Goloka Vrndavana or in another Vaikuntha planet. In the spiritual body there
are no longer material desires, and one is fully satisfied by rendering service to the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Radha and Krsna. This is the platform of bhakti
(hrsikena hrsikesa-sevanam bhaktir ucyate). When the spiritual body, mind and
senses are completely purified, one can render service to the Supreme Personality
of Godhead and His consort. In Vaikuntha, the consort is Laksmi, and in Goloka

Vindavana the consort if $rimati Radharani. In the spiritual body, free from ma-
terial contamination, one can serve Radha-Krsna and Laksmi-Nardayana. When one
is thus spiritually situated, he no longer thinks of his own personal sense gratifica-
tion. This spiritual body is called siddha-deha, the body by which one can render
transcendental service unto Radha and Krsna. The process is that of engaging the
transcendental senses in loving devotional service. This verse specifically men-
tions, sakhi-bhave paya radha-krsnera carana: only transcendentally elevated per-
sons in the mood of the gopis can engage in the service of the lotus feet of Radha
and Krsna.

gopi-anugatya vina aisvarya-jiane
bhajileha nahi paya vrajendra-nandane
SYNONYMS
gopi-anugatya—subservience to the gopis; vina—without; aisvarya-jiane—in
the knowledge of opulence; bhajileha—if serving the Supreme Lord; nahi—not;
pdya—gets; vrajendra-nandane—the son of Maharaja Nanda, Krsna.
TRANSLATION
“Unless one follows in the footsteps of the gopis, he cannot attain the ser-
vice of the lotus feet of Krsna, the son of Nanda Maharaja. If one is overcome
by knowledge of the Lord’s opulence, he cannot attain the Lord’s lotus feet,
even though he is engaged in devotional service.
PURPORT
One can worship Laksmi-Narayana by the process of vidhi-marga, worshiping
the Lord with regulative principles according to the instructions of the sastra and
the spiritual master. However, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Radha-Krsna,
cannot be directly worshiped by this process. The dealings between Radha and
Krsna and the gopis are devoid of the opulences of Laksmi-Narayana. The process
of vidhi-marga, following the regulative principles, is utilized in the worship of
Laksmi-Narayana, whereas the process of spontaneous service —following in the
footsteps of the gopis, who are the denizens of Vrndavana—is transcendentally
more advanced and is the process whereby Radha and Krsna are worshiped. One
cannot attain this elevated position while worshiping the Lord in His opulence.
Those attracted by the conjugal love between Radha and Krsna must follow in the

234 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 8
footsteps of the gopis. Only then is it possible to enter into the Lord's service in
Goloka Vrndavana and directly associate with Radha and Krsna.

“The unspoken example in this connection is the goddess of fortune, who
worshiped Lord Krsna in order to attain His pastimes in Vrndavana. However,
due to her opulent life-style, she could not attain the service of Krsna in
Vrndavana.

“ ‘When Lord $ri Krsna was dancing with the gopis in the rasa-lila, the gopis
were embraced around the neck by the Lord’s arms. This transcendental favor
was never enjoyed by the goddess of fortune or other consorts in the spiritual
world. Nor was such a thing ever imagined by the most beautiful girls from
the heavenly planets, whose bodily luster and flavor exactly resemble a lotus
flower. And what to speak of worldly women, who are very beautiful accord-
ing to the material estimation?’ ^^

edge.

TRANSLATION
On one occasion, the Lord inquired, ‘Of all types of education, which is the
most important?’ Raimananda Raya replied, ‘There is no education that is im-
portant other than the transcendental devotional service of Krsna.”
PURPORT
Texts 245 to 257 are all questions and answers between Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu and Ramananda Raya. In these exchanges there is an attempt to
show the difference between material and spiritual existence. Education in Krsna
consciousness is always transcendental and is the best of all forms of education.
Material education aims at increasing the activities of material sense gratification.
Beyond material sense gratification is another negative form of knowledge called
brahma-vidya, or transcendental knowledge. However, beyond that brahma-
vidya, or knowledge of the impersonal Brahman, is knowledge of devotional ser-
vice to the Supreme Lord, Visnu. This knowledge is higher. And higher still is devo-
tional service to Lord Krsna, which is the topmost form of education. According to
Srimad-Bhagavatam (4.29.49):
tat karma hari-tosari yat
sa vidya tan-matir yaya
“Work meant for pleasing the Supreme Lord is best, and education that enhances
one's Krsna consciousness is the best.”
Also, according to Srimad-Bhagavatam (7.5.23-24):
Sravaparn kirtanarh visnoh
smaranan pada-sevanam
arcanam vandanari dasyam
sakhyam atma-nivedanam
iti pumsarpita visnau
bhaktis cen nava-laksana
kriyeta bhagavaty addha
tan manye ‘dhitam uttamam
This is a statement given by Prahlada Maharaja in answer to a question raised by
his father. Prahlada Maharaja said, “To hear or chant about Lord Visnu, to remem-
ber Him, to serve His lotus feet, to worship Him, to offer prayers to Him, to be-
come His servant and His friend, to sacrifice everything for His service —all these
are varieties of devotional service. One who is engaged in such activities is under-
stood to be educated to the topmost perfection.”

‘krsna-bhakta baliya yanhara haya khyati’
SYNONYMS
kirti-gana-madhye —among glorious activities; jivera—of the living entity;
kon—which; bada—greatest; kirti—glory; krspa-bhakta—a devotee of Lord
Krsna; baliya—as; yanhara—of whom; haya—there is; khyati—the reputation.
TRANSLATION
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu then asked Ramananda Raya, “Out of all glorious
activities, which is the most glorious?’ Ramananda Raya replied, “That per-
son who is reputed to be a devotee of Lord Krsna’s enjoys the utmost fame and
glory.”
PURPORT
The greatest reputation a living being can have is to be a devotee of Krsna’s and
to act in Krsna consciousness. In the material world everyone is trying to be
famous by accumulating a large bank balance or material opulence. There is a
steady competition among karmis attempting to advance in a wealthy society.
The whole world is turning in accordance with that competitive mood. However,
this kind of name and fame is temporary, for it lasts only as long as the temporary
material body exists. One may become famous as a brahma-jiani, an imper-
sonalist scholar, or one may become a materially opulent person. In either case,
such reputations are inferior to the reputation of Krsna’s devotee. In the Garuda
Purana it is said:
kalau bhagavatarn nama
durlabhari naiva labhyate
brahma-rudra-padotkrstarm
guruna kathitarn mama
“In this age of Kali, the fame of one who is known as a great devotee is very rare.
However, such a position is superior to that of the great demigods like Brahma and
Mahadeva. This is the opinion of all spiritual masters.”
In the /tihasa-samuccaya, Narada tells Pundarika:

“After many, many births, when a person realizes that he is the eternal servant of
Vasudeva, he can deliver all the worlds.”
In the Adi Purana, in a conversation between Krsna and Arjuna, it is said:
bhaktanam anugacchanti
muktayah srutibhih saha
“The most exalted position of liberation is given by Vedic knowledge. Everyone
follows in the footsteps of the devotee.”
Similarly, in the Brhan-naradiya Purana, it is further stated:
adyapi ca muni-srestha
brahmadya api devatah
“Until now, even the great demigods like Brahma and Lord Siva did not know the
influence of a devotee.”
Similarly, in the Caruda Purana it is stated:
brahmananarn sahasrebhyah satra-yaji visisyate
satra-yaji-sahasrebhyah sarva-vedanta-paragah
sarva-vedanta-vit-kotya visnu-bhakto visisyate
vaispavanam sahasrebhya ekanty eko visisyate
“It is said that out of thousands of brahmanas, one is qualified to perform
sacrifices, and out of many thousands of such qualified brahmanas expert in
sacrificial offerings, one learned brahmana may have passed beyond all Vedic
knowledge. He is considered the best among all these brahmanas. And yet, out of
thousands of such brahmanas who have surpassed Vedic knowledge, one person
may be a visnu-bhakta, and he is most famous. Out of many thousands of such
Vaisnavas, one who is completely fixed in the service of Lord Krsna is most
famous. Indeed, a person who is completely devoted to the service of the Lord
certainly returns home, back to Godhead”
There is also a statement in the Srimad-Bhagavatam (3.13.4), stating:
Srutasya pumsarn sucira-sramasya
nanv 27/25 saribhir 10100 10090


--- Page 247 ---
244 $ri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 8
tat-tad-gunanusravanarh mukunda-
pdadaravindarih hrdayesu yesam
“After much hard labor, a person highly learned in Vedic literature is certainly very
famous. However, one who is always hearing and chanting the glories of the lotus
feet of Mukunda within his heart is certainly superior.”
In the Nardyana-vyaha-stava, it is said:
naham brahmapi bhayasam
tvad-bhakti-rahito hare
tvayi bhaktas tu kito ‘pi
bhayasari janma-janmasu
“I do not aspire to take birth as a Brahma if that Brahma is not a devotee of the
Lord. | shall be satisfied simply to take birth as an insect if | am given a chance to
remain in the house of a devotee.”

There are many similar verses in Srimad-Bhagavatam, especially 3.25.38,
4.24.29, 4.31.22, 7.9.24, and 10.14.30.

It was Lord Siva who said: “I do not know the truth about Krsna, but a devotee
of Lord Krsna's knows all the truth. Out of all the devotees of Lord Krsna, Prahlada
is the greatest.”

Above Prahlada, the Pandavas are supposedly more advanced. Above the Pan-
davas are the members of the Yadu dynasty, who are even more advanced. In the
Yadu dynasty, Uddhava is the furthest advanced, and above Uddhava are the
damsels of Vraja-dhama, the gopis themselves.

In the Brhad-vamana Purana, Bhrgu is told by Lord Brahma:

sasti-varsa-sahasrani
maya taptam tapah pura
nanda-gopa-vraja-strinarm
pada-renapalabdhaye
“I underwent meditation and austerities for 60,000 years just to understand the
dust of the lotus feet of the gopis. Still, I could not understand them. To say
nothing of me, even Lord Siva, Lord Sesa and the goddess of fortune Laksmi could
not understand them.”

In the Adi Purana the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself says:

na tatha me priyatamo
brahma rudras ca parthiva

na ca laksmir na catma ca
yatha gopi-jano mama


--- Page 248 ---
Text 247] Talks Between the Lord and Ramananda Raya 245
“Lord Brahma, Lord Siva, the goddess of fortune and even My own Self are not as
dear to Me as the gopis!” Of all the gopis Srimati Radharanti is the topmost. Rapa
Gosvami and Sanatana Gosvami are the most exalted servitors of Srimatt
Radharani and Lord ऽन Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Those who adhere to their service
are known as nipanuga devotees. Caitanya-candramrta (127) gives the following
statement about Srila Ripa Gosvami:
asta vairagya-kotir bhavatu $ama-dama-ksanti-maitry-adi-kotis

koty-amso ‘py asya na syat tad api guna-gano yah svatah-siddha aste
$rimac-caitanyacandra-priya-carana-nakha-jyotir amoda-bhajam
The qualities of one engaged in the service of Lord जा Caitanya Mahaprabhu—
such as reputation, austerities, penances and knowledge—are not to be com-
pared to the good qualities of others. Such is the perfection of a devotee always
engaged in the service of $i Caitanya Mahaprabhu.

Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu asked, “Of the many capitalists who possess great

Everyone in this material world is attempting to acquire riches to satisfy the
senses. Actually no one cares for anything other than acquiring material posses-
sions and maintaining them. The wealthy are generally accepted as the most im-
portant personalities in this material world, but when we compare a material man

of wealth to one wealthy in devotional service to Radha and Krsna, the latter is

As stated in Srimad-8hagavatam (10.33.37):

“Lord Krsna descends apparently as a human being, and He exhibits His transcen-
dental pastimes in Vrndavana so that the conditioned soul may be attracted to
hearing His transcendental activities!” Nondevotees are strictly prohibited from
participating in songs celebrating the loving affairs of Radha and Krsna. Unless one
is a devotee, it is very dangerous to hear the songs about the pastimes of Radha
and Krsna that were written by Jayadeva Gosvami, Candidasa and other exalted
devotees. Lord Siva drank an ocean of poison, but one should not imitate this.
One must first become a pure devotee of Lord Krsna. Only then can one enjoy
hearing the songs of Jayadeva and relish transcendental bliss. If one simply imi-
tates the activities of Lord Siva and drinks poison, one will certainly meet with
death.

Text 256] Talks Between the Lord and Rimananda Raya 253
When one is liberated and hears of Lord Krsna's and Radha'’s loving affairs, he is
not inclined to have lusty desires. One mundane rogue once said that when the
Vaisnavas chant the name “Radha, Radha,” he simply remembers a barber's wife
named Radha. This is a practical example. Unless one is liberated, he should not
try to hear about the loving affairs between Radha and Krsna. If one is not liber-
ated and listens to a relation of the rasa dance, he may remember his mundane ac-
tivities and illicit connections with some woman whose name may also be Radha.
In the conditioned stage one should not even try to remember such things. By
practicing the regulative principles, one should rise to the platform of spon-
taneous attraction for Krsna. Then and only then should one hear about the
radha-krsna-Iila Although these affairs may be very pleasing both to conditioned
and to liberated souls, the conditioned soul should not try to hear them. The talks
between Ramananda Raya and Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu are conducted on the
platform of liberation.

TRANSLATION
“And what is the destination of those who desire liberation and those who
desire sense gratification?’” Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu asked. Ramananda Raya
replied, “Those who attempt to merge into the existence of the Supreme Lord
will have to accept a body like that of a tree. And those who are overly in-
clined toward sense gratification will attain the bodies of demigods.”
PURPORT
Those who desire liberation by merging into the existence of God do not desire
sense gratification within the material world. On the other hand, they have no in-
formation about serving the lotus feet of the Lord. Consequently, they are
doomed to stand like trees for many thousands of years. Although trees are living
entities, they are nonmoving. The liberated soul who attempts to merge into the
existence of the Lord is no better than the trees. Trees also stand in the Lord's ex-
istence because material energy and the Lord's energy are the same. Similarly, the
Brahman effulgence is also the energy of the Supreme Lord. It is the same whether
one remains in the Brahman effulgence or in the material energy because in either
there is no spiritual activity. Better situated are those who desire sense gratifica-
tion and promotion to the heavenly planets. Such people want to enjoy them-
selves like denizens of heaven in gardens of paradise. They at least retain their in-
dividuality in order to enjoy life, but the impersonalists, who try to lose their in-
dividuality, also love both material and spiritual pleasure. The stone is immovable
and has neither material nor spiritual activity. As far as the hard-working karmis are
concerned, $rimad-Bhagavatam states (11.10.23):


--- Page 258 ---
Text 258] Talks Between the Lord and Ramananda Raya 255
istveha devata yajiaih

“After performing various sacrificial rituals for elevation to the heavenly planets,
the karmis go there and enjoy themselves with the demigods to the extent that
they have obtained the results of pious activities.”
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (9.20-21):
trai-vidya marh soma-pah pata-papa
yajiair istva svar-gatim prarthayante
te punyam asadya surendra-lokam

“Those who study the Vedas and drink soma juice, seeking the heavenly planets,
worship Me indirectly. They take birth on the planet of Indra, where they enjoy
godly delights. When they have thus enjoyed heavenly sense pleasure, they
return to this mortal planet again. Thus, through the Vedic principles, they achieve
only flickering happiness.”

Therefore after finishing the results of pious activities, the karmis again return to
this planet in the form of rain, and they begin their life as grass and plants in the
evolutionary process.

the crows that suck the juice from the bitter fruits of the nimba tree of knowl-
edge, whereas those who enjoy mellows are like the cuckoos who eat the buds
of the mango tree of love of Godhead.”
PURPORT
The speculative process of empiric philosophy is as bitter as the fruit of the
nimba tree. The tasting of this fruit is the business of crows. In other words, the
philosophical process of realizing the Absolute Truth is a process taken up by
crowlike men. The cuckoos have very sweet voices with which to chant the holy
name of the Lord and taste the sweet fruit of the mango tree. Such devotees relish
sweet mellows with the Lord.

original source of all intelligence. That savitr is Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu. This is

“The maha-bhagavata, the advanced devotee, certainly sees everything

PURPORT
Due to his deep ecstatic love for Krsna, the maha-bhagavata sees Krsna every-
where and nothing else. This is confirmed in Brahma-sarhita (5.38): premanjana-
cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santah sadaiva hrdayesu vilokayanti.


--- Page 268 ---
Text 274] Talks Between the Lord and Ramananda Raya 265
As soon as a devotee sees something —be it movable or inert—he immediately
remembers Krsna. An advanced devotee is advanced in knowledge. This knowl-
edge is very natural to a devotee, for he has already read in Bhagavad-gita how to
awaken Krsna consciousness. According to Bhagavad-gita:
1350 ham apsu kaunteya
prabhasmi sasi-saryayoh
pranavah sarva-vedesu
sSabdah khe paurusam nrsu
“O son of Kunti [Arjunal, | am the taste of water, the light of the sun and the
moon, the syllable om in the Vedic mantras; | am the sound in ether and ability in
man.’ (Bg. 7.8)

Thus when a devotee drinks water or any other liquid, he immediately remem-
bers Krsna. For a devotee there is no difficulty in awakening Krsna consciousness
twenty-four hours a day. It is therefore said:

sthavara jangama dekhe na dekhe tara marti
sarvatra haya nija ista-deva-spharti
A saintly person, an advanced devotee, sees Krsna twenty-four hours a day and
nothing else. As far as movable and inert things are concerned, a devotee sees
them all as transformations of Krsna's energy. As stated in Bhagavad-gita:
bhamir apo 11210 vayuh
kharh mano buddhir eva ca
aharkara itiyarh me
bhinna prakrtir astadha
“Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego—all together these
eight comprise My separated material energies.” (Bg. 7.4)

Actually nothing is separate from Krsna. When a devotee sees a tree, he knows
that the tree is a combination of two energies — material and spiritual. The inferior
energy, which is material, forms the body of the tree; however, within the tree is
the living entity, the spiritual spark, which is part and parcel of Krsna. This is the
superior energy of Krsna within this world. Whatever living thing we see is simply
a combination of these two energies. When an advanced devotee thinks of these
energies, he immediately understands that they are manifestations of the
Supreme Lord. As soon as we see the sun rise in the morning, we arise and set
about doing our morning duties. Similarly, as soon as a devotee sees the energy of
the Lord, he immediately remembers Lord Sri Krsna. This is explained in this verse:


--- Page 269 ---
266 $ri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 8
sarvatra haya nija ista-deva-spharti
A devotee who has purified his existence through devotional service sees only
Krsna in every step of life. This is also explained in the next verse, which is a
quotation from Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.2.45).

Personality of Godhead as the cause of all causes and understands that all
things are situated in Him.

TRANSLATION

‘The plants, creepers and trees were full of fruits and flowers due to
ecstatic love of Krsna. Indeed, being so full, they were bowing down. They
were inspired by such deep love for Krsna that they were constantly pouring
showers of honey. In this way the gopis saw all the forest of Vrndavana.’ ^“

PURPORT

This verse (Bhag. 10.35.9) is one of the songs the gopis sang during Krsna's ab-
sence. In Krsna's absence the gopis were always absorbed in thought of Him.
Similarly, the php er the advanced devotee, sees everything as potentially
serving the Lord. Srila Ripa Gosvami recommends:

prapancikataya buddhya
hari-sambandhi-vastunah
mumuksubhih parityago
vairagyarn phalgu kathyate
(Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu, 1.2.126)

The advanced devotee does not see anything that is not connected with Krsna.
Unlike the Mayavadi philosophers, a devotee does not see the material world as
false. Rather, he sees everything in the material world connected to Krsna. A devo-
tee knows how to utilize such things in the service of the Lord, and this is charac-
teristic of the maha-bhagavata. The gopis saw the plants, creepers and forest trees
loaded with fruits and flowers and ready to serve Krsna. In this way they im-
mediately remembered their worshipable Lord $ri Krsna. They did not simply see
plants, creepers and trees the way a mundaner sees them.

TRANSLATION
Lord Sri Krsna is the reservoir of all pleasure, and Srimati Radharani is the
personification of ecstatic love of Godhead. These two forms combined as
one in Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. This being the case, Lord Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu revealed His real form to Ramananda Raya.
PURPORT
This is described as radha-bhava-dyuti-suvalitarh naumi krspa-svarapam. Lord
Sri Krsna was absorbed in the features of Srimati Radharant. This was disclosed to
Ramananda Raya when he saw Lord $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. An advanced
devotee can understand $ri-krspa-caitanya, radha-krspa nahe anya. Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu, being a combination of Krsna and Radha, is nondifferent from
Radha-Krsna combined. This is explained by Svarapa Damodara Gosvami:
radha krsna-pranaya-vikrtir hladini saktir asmad
ekatmanav api bhuvi pura deha-bhedarh gatau tau
caitanyakhyarn prakatam adhuna tad-dvayarm caikyam aptarn
radha-bhava-dyuti-suvalitarh naumi krspa-svarapam
(Cc. Adi 1.5)
RadhaKrsna is one. Radha-Krsna is Krsna and Krsna’s pleasure potency combined.
When Krsna exhibits His pleasure potency, He appears to be two—Radha and
Krsna. Otherwise, both Radha and Krsna are one. This oneness may be perceived
by advanced devotees through the grace of $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. This was
the case with Ramananda Raya, and such realization is possible for the advanced
devotee. One may aspire to attain such a position, but one should not try to imi-
tate the maha-bhagavata.

In Bhagavad-gita it is stated:

“I am never manifest to the foolish and unintelligent. For them | am covered by
My eternal creative potency [yogamayal; and so the deluded world knows Me
not, who am unborn and infallible” (Bg. 7.25)

The Lord always reserves the right of not being exposed to everyone. The
devotees, however, are always engaged in the service of the Lord, serving with
the tongue by chanting the Hare Krsna mantra and tasting maha-prasada. Gradu-
ally the sincere devotee pleases the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the
Supreme Lord reveals Himself. One cannot see the Supreme Lord by making per-
sonal efforts. Rather, when the Lord is pleased by the service of a devotee, He
reveals Himself.

My own transcendental features by accepting the complexion of $rimati
Radharani. Without Radharani, one cannot taste the transcendental pleasure of
Krsna's conjugal love!” In this regard, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura com-
ments on the prakrta-sahajiya-sampradaya, which considers Krsna and Lord
Caitanya to possess different bodies. They misinterpret the words gaura arga
nahe mora mentioned herein. From this verse we can understand that Lord
Caitanya Mahaprabhu is nondifferent from Krsna. Both are the same Supreme Per-
sonality of Godhead. In the form of Krsna, the Lord enjoys spiritual bliss and
remains the shelter of all devotees, visaya-vigraha. Krsna in His Gauranga feature
tastes separation from Krsna in the ecstasy of Srimati Radharani. This ecstatic form
is ऽ Krsna Caitanya. 57 Krsna is always the transcendental reservoir of all pleasure,
and He is technically called dhira-lalita. Radharani is the embodiment of spiritual
energy, personified as ecstatic love for Krsna; therefore only Krsna can touch
Srimati Radharant. The dhira-lalita aspect is not seen in any other form of the Lord,
neither in Visnu nor in Narayana. $rimati Radharani is therefore known as Govin-
da-nandini and Govinda-mohini, for She is the only source of transcendental
pleasure for Sri Krsna. Indeed, She is the only person who can enchant His mind.

Riya, ‘Now there is no confidential activity unknown to you. Even though | try
to conceal My activities, you can understand everything in detail by virtue of
your advanced love for Me.”

gupte—in secret; rakhiha—keep; kahan—anywhere; na—not; kario —make;
prakasa—exposure; amara—My; batula-cesta—activities like a madman; loke —
among the general people; upahasa—laughter.
TRANSLATION
The Lord then requested Rimananda Riya: “Keep all these talks a secret.
Please do not expose them anywhere and everywhere. Since My activities ap-
pear to be like those of a madman, people may take them lightly and laugh.”

Caitanya Mahaprabhu then said, “Indeed, | am a madman, and you are also
a madman. Therefore both of us are on the same platform.”
PURPORT
All these conversations between Ramananda Riya and ऽ Caitanya
Mahaprabhu appear ludicrous to a common man who is not a devotee. The entire
world is filled with material conceptions, and people are unable to understand
these conversations due to the conditioning of mundane philosophy. Those who


--- Page 279 ---
276 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 8
are overly attached to mundane activities cannot understand the ecstatic conver-
sations between Ramananda Raya and Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Consequently the
Lord requested that Rimananda Raya keep all these conversations secret and not
expose them to the general populace. If one is actually advanced in Krsna con-
sciousness, he can understand these confidential talks; otherwise they appear
crazy. ঠা Caitanya Mahaprabhu therefore informed Ramananda Raya that they
both appeared as madmen and were therefore on the same platform. It is con-
firmed in Bhagavad-gita:
ya nisa sarva-bhatanam
tasyam jagarti samyami
yasyarh jagrati bhatani
sd nisa pasyato muneh
“What is night for all beings is the time of awakening for the self-controlled; and
the time of awakening for all beings is night for the introspective sage.” (Bg. 2.69)
Sometimes Krsna consciousness appears like a type of madness to mundane
people, just as the activities of mundaners are considered a form of madness by
Krsna conscious men.

sion.

PURPORT
Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura gives the following summary of the conversations
between Ramananda Raya and Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Ramananda Raya
replied to five questions of 5 Caitanya Mahaprabhu, stated in verses 57-67. The
first answer is compared to copper, and the fifth answer is most valuable because
it deals with unalloyed devotion, the ultimate goal of devotional life, and illumi-
nates the preceding four subordinate answers.


--- Page 281 ---
278 $ri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 8
Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura points out that in Vrajabhami there is
the Yamuna River with its sandy banks. There are kadamba trees, cows, Krsna's
sticks with which He herds cows, and Krsna'’s flute. All of these belong to the san-
ta-rasa, the mellow of neutrality in devotional service. There are also the direct
servants of Krsna named Citraka, Patraka and Raktaka, and these are the embodi-
ments of service in the mellow of servitude. There are also friends like $ridama,
Sudama and others who embody service in fraternity. Nanda Maharaja and
mother Yasoda are the embodiments of paternal love. Above all of these is Srimati
Radharant and Her assistants, the gopis Lalita, Visakha and others. In this way all
five mellows— santa, dasya, sakhya, vatsalya and madhurya—exist eternally. They
are also compared to metals like copper, bell metal, silver, gold and touchstone.
Srila Kavirdgja Gosvami therefore refers to a metal mine eternally existing in
Vrndavana, Vrajabhami.

PURPORT
In almost all the cities and towns of India there are temples of Hanumanyji, the
eternal servant of Lord Ramacandra. There is even a temple of Hanuman near
Govindaji temple in Vindavana. Formerly this temple was in front of the Gopalaji
temple, but that Deity Gopalaji went to Orissa to remain as Saksi-gopala. Being
the eternal servant of Lord Ramacandra, Hanumanji has been respectfully
worshiped for many hundreds and thousands of years. Here even Lord Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu set the example in showing how one should offer respects
to Hanumanij.

dental treasure.

PURPORT

Sri Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura says that Krsna is obtainable for the
faithful, but for those who are accustomed to argue, Krsna is far, far away. Similarly,
these talks between Ramananda Raya and $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu can be
understood by a person who has firm faith. Those who are not in the disciplic suc-
cession, the asauta-panthis, cannot have faith in these talks. They are always
doubting and engaging in mental concoctions. These talks cannot be understood
by such whimsical people. Transcendental topics remain far, far away from those
engaged in mundane arguments. In this regard, the Vedic mantras in the Katha
Upanisad (1.2.9) state, naisa tarkepna matir dpaneya proktanyenaiva sujianaya
prestha. According to the Mundaka Upanisad (3.2.3), nadyam atma pravacanena
labhyo na medhaya na bahuna srutena/ yam evaisa vrnute tena labhyas tasyaisa
atma vivrpute tandrn svam. And according to the Brahma-satra (2.1.11),
tarkapratisthanat.

All Vedic literatures declare that transcendental subjects cannot be understood
simply by argument or logic. Spiritual matters are far above experimental knowl-
edge. If one is interested in the transcendental loving affairs of Krsna, it is only by
Krsna's mercy that he can understand them. If one tries to understand these tran-
scendental topics simply by using one’s material brain substance, the attempt will


--- Page 289 ---
286 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 8
be futile. It doesn’t matter whether one is a prakrta-sahajiya, a mundane oppor-
tunist or a scholar; one’s labor to understand these topics by mundane means will
ultimately be frustrated. One therefore has to give up all mundane attempts and
try to become a pure devotee of Lord Visnu. When a devotee follows the regula-
tive principles, the truth of these talks will be revealed to him. This is confirmed:
atah $ri-krspa-namadi
na bhaved grahyam indriyaih
sevonmukhe hi jihvadau
svayam eva sphuraty adah
(Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu, 1.2.109)

One cannot understand the holy name of the Lord, His pastimes, form,
qualities, and entourage by blunt material senses. However, when the senses are
purified by the constant rendering of service, the spiritual truth of the pastimes of
Radha and Krsna are revealed. As confirmed in the Mundaka Upanisad: yam
evaisa vrnute tena labhyas. Only one who is favored by the Supreme Personality
of Godhead can understand the transcendental features of $ri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu.

TRANSLATION

॥ have tried to preach the pastimes of Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s meet-
ing with Rimananda Raya in accordance with the notebooks of Sri Svarupa
Damodara.

PURPORT

At the end of every chapter, the author admits the value of the disciplic succes-
sion. He never claims to have written this transcendental literature by carrying out
research work. He simply admits his indebtedness to the notes taken by SvarGpa
Damodara, Raghunatha dasa Gosvami and other authoritative persons. This is the
way of describing transcendental literatures, which are never meant for so-called
scholars and research workers. The process is mahajano yena gatah sa panthah:
one has to strictly follow great personalities and dcaryas. Acaryavan puruso veda:
one who has the favor of the dcarya knows everything. This statement made by
Kavirdja Gosvami is very valuable for all pure devotees. Sometimes the prakrta-
sahajiyas claim that they have heard the truth from their guru. However, one can-
not have transcendental knowledge simply by hearing from a guru who is not
bona fide. The guru must be bona fide, and he must have heard from his bona fide
guru. Only then will his message be accepted as bona fide. This is confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita:

$ri bhagavan uvaca
imam vivasvate yogam

proktavan aham avyayam
vivasvan manave praha

manur iksvakave ‘bravit

“The Blessed Lord said: | instructed this imperishable science of yoga to the sun-

god, Vivasvan, and Vivasvan instructed it to Manu, the father of mankind, and

Manu in turn instructed it to lksvaku!’ (Bg. 4.1)

In this way the message is transmitted in the bona fide spiritual disciplic succes-
sion from bona fide spiritual master to bona fide student. $rila Kaviraja Gosvami
therefore as usual concludes this chapter by reasserting his faith in the lotus feet
of the six Gosvamis. Thus he is able to set forth this transcendental literature,
Caitanya-caritamrta.

CHAPTER 9

Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu'’s
Travels to the Holy Places
A summary of the Ninth Chapter is given by Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura. After
leaving Vidyanagara, 67 Caitanya Mahaprabhu visited such places of pilgrimage as
Cautami-gangd, Mallikirjuna, Ahovala-nrsimha, Siddhavata, Skanda-ksetra, Tri-
matha, Vrddhakasi, Bauddha-sthana, Tripati, Trimalla, Pana-nrsirhha, Siva-kanci,
Visnu-kafici, Trikdla-hasti, Vrddhakola, Siyali-bhairavi, Kaveri-tira and Kumbhakar-
na-kapala.

Finally the Lord went to Sri Ranga-ksetra, where He converted a brahmana
named Vyenkata Bhatta, who, along with his family, became a devotee of Krsna.
After leaving भां Ranga, Caitanya Mahaprabhu reached Rsabha-parvata, where He
met Paramdnanda Puri, who later arrived at Jagannatha Puri. Lord भी Caitanya
Mahaprabhu then proceeded farther, arriving at Setubandha Ramesvara. At Sri
Saila-parvata, the Lord met Lord Siva and his wife Durga in the dress of a brahmana
and brahmani. From there He went to Kamakosthi-puri and later arrived at
southern Mathura. A brdhmana devotee of Lord Rimacandra talked with Him.
Then the Lord took His bath in the River Krtamald. On the hill known as
Mahendra-$aila, the Lord saw Parasurdma. Then the Lord went to Setubandha and
took His bath at Dhanus-tirtha. He also visited Ramesvara, where He collected
some papers connected with Sitadevi, whose illusory form was kidnapped by
Ravana. The Lord next visited the places known as Pandya-desa, Tamraparni,
Nayatripadi, Ciyadatala, 13120, Gajendra-moksana, Panagadi, Camtapura, Sri
Vaikuntha, Malaya-parvata and Kanyakumari. The Lord then met the Bhattatharis
at Mallara-desa and saved Kala Krsnadasa from their clutches. The Lord also col-
lected Brahma-sarnhitd, Fifth Chapter, on the banks of the Payasvini River. He then
visited Payasvini, Smigavera-puri-matha and Matsya-tirtha. At the village of Udupi,
He saw the (00812 installed by ঠা Madhvacarya. He then defeated the Tat-
tvavddis in $astric conversation. The Lord next visited Phalgu-tirtha, Tritakapa,
Paficapsard, Sarparaka and Kolapura. At গা Rangapuri the Lord received news of
Sankardranya's disappearance. He then went to the banks of the Krsnavenva
River, where He collected from among the Vaisnava brahmanas a book written by
Bilvamangala, Krsna-karndmrta. The Lord then visited Tapti, Mahismati-pura, Nar-
madd-tira and Rsyamiaka-parvata. He entered Dandakaranya and liberated the
seven palm trees. From there He visited a place known as Pampa-sarovara and
visited Paficavati, Nasika, Brahmagiri and also the source of the Godavari River,

Kusavarta. Thus the Lord visited almost all the holy places in South India. He finally
returned to Jagannatha Puri by taking the same route, after visiting Vidyanagara
again.

TRANSLATION

Lord Sri Caitanya Mahiaprabhu converted the inhabitants of South India.
These people were as strong as elephants, but they were under the clutches of
the crocodiles of various philosophies—such as the Buddhist, Jaina and
Mayavada philosophies. By His disc of mercy, the Lord converted all of them
into Vaisnavas, devotees of the Lord.

PURPORT

Herein it is stated that the Lord delivered the Cajendra, the elephant, who was
being attacked by crocodiles. When ১ Caitanya Mahaprabhu visited southern In-
dia, almost all the residents were under the claws of crocodiles presenting Bud-
dhist, Jaina and Mayavada philosophy. Although Kaviraja Cosvami states that
these people were as strong as elephants, they were actually under the clutches
of death because they were being attacked by the crocodiles of various philoso-
phies. However, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu saved the elephant from the clutches
of the crocodiles by His mercy.

TRANSLATION
When the Lord visited all those holy places, He converted many thousands
of residents. Thus many people were delivered. Simply by touching the holy
places, He made them into great places of pilgrimage.
PURPORT
It is said: tirthi-kurvanti tirthani. A tirtha, or holy place, is a place where great
saintly personalities visit or reside. Although the holy places were already places
of pilgrimage, they .were all purified by जा Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s visit. Many
people go to these holy places and leave their sinful activities there, thus becom-
ing free from contamination. When these contaminations pile up, they are coun-
teracted by the visit of great personalities like ऽ Caitanya Mahaprabhu and His
strict followers. Many kinds of patients come to a hospital, which may be infected
by many types of disease. Actually the hospital is always infected, but the expert
physician keeps the hospital sterilized by his expert presence and management.
Similarly, places of pilgrimage are always infected by the sins left by the sinners
who go there, but when a personality like 5 Caitanya Mahaprabhu visits such a
place, all contaminations vanish.

TRANSLATION

As previously stated, all the residents of the villages visited by Lord
Caitanya became Vaisnavas and began to chant Hari and Krsna. In this way, in
all the villages visited by the Lord, everyone became a Vaisnava, a devotee.

PURPORT

The holy names of Krsna and Hari, or the chanting of the Hare Krsna maha-
mantra, are so spiritually powerful that even today, as our preachers go to remote
parts of the world, people immediately begin chanting Hare Krsna. $ri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu was the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. There cannot be
anyone who can compare to Him or His potencies. However, because we are
following in His footsteps and are also chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra, the
effect is almost as potent as during the time of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Our
preachers mainly belong to European and American countries, yet by the grace of
Lord Caitanya they have tremendous success wherever they go to open
branches. Indeed, everywhere people are very seriously chanting Hare Krsna, Hare
Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.

sion of नं Ramanujacarya
TRANSLATION
At the time, all the South Indian Vaisnavas were worshipers of Lord Rama-
candra. Some were Tattvavadis, and some were followers of Ramanujacarya.
PURPORT
Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura points out that Tattvavadi refers to the
followers of Srila Madhvacarya To distinguish his disciplic succession from the
Mayavadi followers of Sankaracarya, Srila Madhvacarya named his party the Tat-
tvavada. Impersonal monists are always attacked by these Tattvavadis, who at-


--- Page 299 ---
296 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 9
tempt to defeat their philosophy of impersonalism. Generally, they establish the
supremacy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Actually the disciplic succes-
sion of Madhvacarya is known as the Brahma-Vaisnava sect; that is the sect com-
ing down from Lord Brahma. Consequently the Tattvavadis, or followers of
Madhvacarya, do not accept the incident of Lord Brahma’s illusion, which is
recorded in the Tenth Canto of $Srimad-Bhagavatam. $rila Madhvacarya has pur-
posefully avoided commenting on that portion of Srimad-Bhagavatam in which
brahma-mohana, the illusion of Lord Brahma, is mentioned. 6712 Madhavendra
Puri was one of the acaryas in the Tattvavada disciplic succession, and he
established the ultimate goal of transcendentalism to be attainment of pure devo-
tional service, love of Godhead. Those Vaisnavas belonging to the Gaudiya-
sampradaya, the disciplic succession following Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, are dis-
tinct from the Tattvavadis, although they belong to the same Tattvavada
sampradidya. The followers of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu are therefore known as
the Madhva-Gaudiya-sampradaya.

The word pasandi refers to those who are opposed to pure devotional service.
In particular, these are the Mayavadis, the impersonalists. A definition of pasandiis
given in the Hari-bhakti-vilasa (1.73), wherein it is stated:

yas tu nardyanam devam
brahma-rudradi-daivataih
samatvenaiva vikseta
sa pasandi bhaved dhruvam
A pasandi is one who thinks that the Supreme Lord Narayana, the Personality of
Godhead, is on the same level with the demigods headed by Lord Brahma and
Lord Siva. The devotee never considers Lord Narayana to be on the same platform
with Lord Brahma and Lord $iva. The Madhvacarya-sampradaya and Ramanuja-
sampradaya are mainly worshipers of Lord Ramacandra, although the Sri
Vaisnavas are supposed to be worshipers of Lord Narayana and Laksmi and the
Tattvavadis are supposed to be worshipers of Lord Krsna. At present, in most of
the monasteries belonging to the Madhva-sampradaya, Lord Ramacandra is
worshiped.

In the book known as Adhyatma-ramayana, there are statements in Chapters
Twelve to Fifteen about the worship of the Deities ঠা Ramacandra and Sita. There
it is stated that during Lord Ramacandra’s time, there was a brahmana who took a
vow refusing to accept breakfast until he saw Lord Ramacandra. Sometimes, due
to business, Lord Ramacandra was absent from His capital for a full week and
could not be seen by citizens during that time. Because of his vow, the brahmana
could not take even a drop of water during that week. Later, after eight or nine
days, when the brahmana could see Lord Ramacandra personally, he would break
his fast. Upon observing the brahmana'’s rigid vow, Lord ऽ Ramacandra ordered


--- Page 300 ---
Text 12] Lord Caitanya’s Travels to the Holy Places 297
His younger brother Laksmana to deliver a pair of Sita-Rama Deities to the
brahmana. The brahmana received the Deities from Sri Laksmanaji and worshiped
them faithfully as long as he lived. At the time of his death, he delivered the
Deities to Sri Hanumanji, who, for many years, hung Them around his neck and
served Them with all devotion. After many years, when Hanumanji departed on
the hill known as Gandha-madana, he delivered the Deities to Bhimasena, one of
the Pandavas, and Bhimasena brought Them to his palace, where he kept Them
very carefully. The last king of the Pandavas, Ksemakanta, worshiped the Deities in
that palace. Later, the same Deities were kept in the custody of the kings of
Orissa known as Gajapatis. One of the acaryas, known as Narahari Tirtha, who
was in the disciplic succession of Madhvacarya, received these Deities from the
King of Orissa.

It may be noted that these particular Deities of Rama and Sita have been
worshiped from the time of King tksvaku. Indeed, they were worshiped by the
royal princes even before the appearance of Lord Ramacandra. Later, during Lord
Ramacandra’s presence, the Deities were worshiped by Laksmana. It is said that
just three months before his disappearance, $ri Madhviacarya received these
Deities and installed them in the Udupi temple. Since then the Deities have been
worshiped by the Madhvacarya-sampradaya at that monastery. As far as the $ri
Vaisnavas are concerned, beginning with Ramanujacarya, they also worshiped
Deities of Sita-Rama. Sita-Rama Deities are also being worshiped in Tirupati and
other places. From the $ri Ramanuja-sampradaya there is another branch known
as Ramanandi or Ramat, and the followers of that branch also worship Deities of
Sita-Rama very rigidly. The Ramanuja-sampradaya Vaisnavas prefer the worship of
Lord Ramacandra to Radha-Krsna.

TRANSLATION
While walking on the road, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu used to chant this
Rama Raghava mantra. Chanting in this way, He arrived at the banks of the
Gautami-ganga and took His bath there.
PURPORT
The Gautami-ganga is another branch of the River Godavari. Formerly a great
sage named Gautama Rsi used to live on the bank of this river opposite the city of
Rajamahendri, and consequently this branch was called the Gautami-ganga.
Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura says that Srila Kaviraja Gosvami has recorded the
names of the holy places visited by $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu but that there is no
chronological order of the places visited. However, there is a notebook of Govin-

da dasa’s containing a chronological order and references to geographical posi-
tions. Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura requests the readers to refer to that book. Ac-
cording to Govinda dasa, $f Caitanya Mahaprabhu went to Trimanda from the
Gautami-gangd. From there He went to Dhundirama-tirtha, another place of
pilgrimage. According to this book, after visiting Gautami-ganga, Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu went to Mallikarjuna-tirtha.

TRANSLATION

The scriptures of the Buddhist cult are chiefly based on argument and logic,
and they contain nine chief principles. Because Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu
defeated them in their argument, they could not establish their cult.

PURPORT

Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura states that according to the Buddhist cult there are
two ways of understanding philosophy. One is called hinayana, and the other is
called mahayana. Along this path, there are nine principles. (1) The creation is
eternal; therefore there is no need to accept a creator. (2) This cosmic manifesta-
tion is false. (3) “I am” is the truth. (4) There is repetition of birth and death. (5)
Lord Buddha is the only source of understanding the truth. (6) The principle of nir-
vana, or annihilation, is the ultimate goal. (7) The philosophy of Buddha is the only
philosophical path. (8) The Vedas are compiled by human beings. (9) Pious ac-
tivities, showing mercy to others and so on are advised.

No one can attain the Absolute Truth by argument. One may be very expert in
logic, and another person may be even more expert in the art of argument. Be-
cause there is so much word jugglery in logic, one can never come to the real con-
clusion about the Absolute Truth by argument. The followers of Vedic principles
understand this. However, it is seen here that $i Caitanya Mahaprabhu defeated
the Buddhist philosophy by argument. Those who are preachers in ISKCON will
certainly meet many people who believe in intellectual arguments. Most of these


--- Page 319 ---
316 $ Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-Iila, Ch. 9
people do not believe in the authority of the Vedas. Nevertheless, they accept in-
tellectual speculation and argument. Therefore the preachers of Krsna conscious-
ness should be prepared to defeat others by argument, just as Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu did. In this verse it is clearly said, tarkei khandila prabhu. Lord Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu put forward such a strong argument that they could not
counter Him to establish their cult.

Their first principle is that the creation is always existing, but if this is the case,
there can be no theory of annihilation. The Buddhists maintain that annihilation or
dissolution is the highest truth. If the creation is eternally existing, there is no
question of dissolution or annihilation. This argument is not very strong because
by practical experience we see that material things have a beginning, a middle
and an end. The ultimate aim of the Buddhist philosophy is to dissolve the body.
This is proposed because the body has a beginning. Similarly, the entire cosmic
manifestation is also a gigantic body, but if we accept the fact that it is always ex-
isting, there can be no question of annihilation. Therefore the attempt to annihi-
late everything in order to attain zero is an absurdity. By our own practical ex-
perience we have to accept the beginning of creation, and when we accept the
beginning, we must accept a creator. Such a creator must possess an all-pervasive
body, as pointed out by Bhagavad-gita:

sarvatah pani-padarn tat
sarvato ’ksi-$iro-mukham
sarvatah srutimal loke
sarvam avrtya tisthati
“Everywhere are His hands and legs, His eyes and faces, and He hears everything.
In this way the Supersoul exists!” (Bg. 13.14)

The Supreme Person must be present everywhere. His body existed before the
creation; otherwise He could not be the creator. If the Supreme Person is a cre-
ated being, there can be no question of a creator. The conclusion is that the cos-
mic manifestation is certainly created at a certain time, and the creator existed
before the creation; therefore the creator is not a created being. The creator is
Pararn Brahman, or the Supreme Spirit. Matter is not only subordinate to spirit but
is actually created on the basis of spirit. When the spirit soul enters the womb of a
mother, the body is created by material ingredients supplied by the mother. Every-
thing is created in the material world, and consequently there must be a creator
who is the Supreme Spirit and who is distinct from matter. It is confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita that the material energy is inferior and that the spiritual energy is
the living entity. Both inferior and superior energies belong to a supreme person.

The Buddhists argue that the world is false, but this is not valid. The world is
temporary, but it is not false. As long as we have the body, we must suffer the


--- Page 320 ---
Text 49] Lord Caitanya’s Travels to the Holy Places 317
pleasures and pains of the body, even though we are not the body. We may not
take these pleasures and pains very seriously, but they are factual nonetheless.
We cannot actually say that they are false. If the bodily pains and pleasures are
false, the creation would be false also, and consequently no one would take very
much interest in it. The conclusion is that the material creation is not false or
imaginary, but it is temporary.

The Buddhists maintain that the principle “I am” is the Ultimate Truth, but this
excludes the individuality of “I” and “you.” If there is no “I and “you,” or in-
dividuality, there is no possibility of argument. The Buddhist philosophy depends
on argument, but there can be no argument if one simply depends on “I am.’
There must be a “you,” or another person also. The philosophy of duality —the ex-
istence of the individual soul and the Supersoul— must be there. This is confirmed
in the Second Chapter of Bhagavad-git3, wherein the Lord says:

na tv evaharh jatu nasa
na tvam neme janadhipah
na caiva na bhavisyamah
sarve vayam atah param
“Never was there a time when | did not exist, nor you, nor all these kings; nor in
the future shall any of us cease to be!’ (Bg. 2.12)

We existed in the past in different bodies, and after the annihilation of this
body, we shall exist in another body. The principle of the soul is eternal, and it ex-
ists in this body or in another body. Even in this lifetime we experience existence
in a child's body, ৪ youth’s body, a man’s body and an old body. After the annihila-
tion of the body, we acquire another body. The Buddhist cult also accepts the phi-
losophy of transmigration, but the Buddhists do not properly explain the next
birth. There are 8,400,000 species of life, and our next birth may be in any one of
them; therefore this human body is not guaranteed.

According to the Buddhist’s fifth principle, Lord Buddha is the only source for
the attainment of knowledge. We cannot accept this, for Lord Buddha rejected
the principles of Vedic knowledge. One must accept a principle of standard
knowledge because one cannot attain the Absolute Truth simply by intellectual
speculation. If everyone is an authority, or if everyone accepts his own intelli-
gence as the ultimate criterion—as is presently fashionable —the scriptures will be
interpreted in many different ways, and everyone will claim his own philosophy
supreme. This has become a very great problem, and everyone is interpreting
scripture in his own way and setting up his own basis of authority. Yata mata tata
patha. Now everybody and anybody is trying to establish his own theory as the
Ultimate Truth. The Buddhists theorize that annihilation, or nirvana, is the ultimate
goal. Annihilation applies to the body, but the spirit soul transmigrates from one


--- Page 321 ---
318 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 9
body to another. If this were not the case, how can so many multifarious bodies
come into existence? If the next birth is a fact, the next bodily form is also a fact.
As soon as we accept a material body, we must accept the fact that that body will
be annihilated and that we will have to accept another body. If all material bodies
are doomed to annihilation, we must obtain a nonmaterial body, or a spiritual
body, if we wish the next birth to be anything but false. How the spiritual body is
attained is explained in Bhagavad-gita:
janma karma ca me divyam
evarh yo vetti tattvatah
tyaktva deharn punar janma
naiti mam eti so ‘rjiuna
“One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does
not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains
My eternal abode, O Arjuna.” (Bg. 4.9)

This is the highest perfection by which one can transcend the transmigration of
material bodies and retum home, back to Godhead. It is not that existence be-
comes void or zero: Existence continues, but if we positively want to annihilate
the material body, we have to accept a spiritual body; otherwise there can be no
eternality for the soul.

We cannot accept the theory that the Buddhist philosophy is the only way, for
there are so many defects in that philosophy. A perfect philosophy is one that has
no defects, and that is Vedanta philosophy. No one can point out any defects in
Vedanta philosophy, and therefore we can conclude that Vedanta is the supreme
philosophical way of understanding the truth. According to the Buddhist cult, the
Vedas are compiled by ordinary human beings. If this were the case, they would
not be authoritative. From Vedic literatures we understand that shortly after the
creation, Lord Brahma was instructed in the Vedas. It is not that the Vedas were
created by Brahma, although Brahma is the original person in the universe. If
Brahma did not create the Vedas, but he is acknowledged as the first created
being, wherefrom did Vedic knowledge come to Brahma? Obviously the Vedas
did not come from an ordinary person born in this material world. According to
S$rimad-Bhagavatam, tene brahma hrda ya adi-kavaye: after the creation, the
Supreme Person imparted Vedic knowledge within the heart of Brahma. There
was no person in the beginning of the creation other than Brahma, yet he did not
compile the Vedas; therefore the conclusion is that the Vedas were not compiled
by any created being. Vedic knowledge was given by the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, who created this material world. This is also accepted by Sarikaracarya,
although Sankaracarya is not a Vaisnava.

It is stated that mercy is one of the qualities of a Buddhist, but mercy is a rela-
tive thing. We show our mercy to a subordinate or to one who is suffering more


--- Page 322 ---
Text 51] Lord Caitanya’s Travels to the Holy Places 319
than ourselves. However, if there is a superior person present, the superior person
cannot be the object of our mercy. Rather, we are objects for the mercy of the
superior person. Therefore showing compassion and mercy is a relative activity. It
is not the Absolute Truth. Apart from this, we also must know what actual mercy
is. To give a sick man something forbidden for him to eat is not mercy. Rather, it is
cruelty. Unless we know what mercy really is, we may create an undesirable situa-
tion. If we wish to show real mercy, we will preach Krsna consciousness in order
to revive the lost consciousness of human beings, the living entity's original con-
sciousness. Since the Buddhist philosophy does not admit the existence of the
spirit soul, the so-called mercy of the Buddhists is defective.

All mental speculators and learned scholars were defeated by Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu, and when the people began to laugh, the Buddhist philosophers
felt both shame and fear.
PURPORT
These philosophers were all atheists, for they did not believe in the existence of
God. Atheists may be very expert in mental speculation and may be so-called
great philosophers, but they can be defeated by a Vaisnava firmly situated in his
conviction and God consciousness. Following in the footsteps of Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu, all the preachers engaged in the service of ISKCON should be very
expert in putting forward strong arguments and defeating all types of atheists.

Text 54] Lord Caitanya’s Travels to the Holy Places 321
TRANSLATION

Having made their plot, the Buddhists brought a plate of untouchable food

before Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and called it maha-prasada.
PURPORT

The word apavitra anna refers to food that is unacceptable for a Vaisnava. In
other words, a Vaisnava cannot accept any food offered by an avaispava in the
name of maha-prasada. This should be a principle for all Vaisnavas. When asked,
“What is the behavior of a Vaisnava?” Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu replied, “A
Vaisnava must avoid the company of an avaisnava lasat].” The word asat refers to
an avaisnava, that is, one who 15 not a Vaisnava. Asat-sariga-tyaga, —ei vaisnava-
acara (Cc. Madhya 22.87). A Vaisnava must be very strict in this respect and
should not at all cooperate with an avaispava. If an avaisnava offers food in the
name of maha-prasada, it should not be accepted. Such food cannot be prasada
because an avaisnpava cannot offer anything to the Lord. Sometimes preachers in
the Krsna consciousness movement have to accept food in a home where the
householder is an avaisnava; however, if this food is offered to the Deity, it can be
taken. Ordinary food cooked by an avaisnava should not be accepted by a
Vaisnava. Even if an avaispava cooks food without fault, he cannot offer it to Lord
Visnu, and it cannot be accepted as maha-prasada. According to Bhagavad-gita:

patra puspam phalam toyam
yo me bhaktya prayacchati
tad aharin bhakty-upahrtam
asnami prayatatmanah
“If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit or water, | will ac-
cept it.” (Bg. 9.26)

Krsna can accept anything offered by His devotee with devotion. An avaispava
may be a vegetarian and a very clean cook, but because he cannot offer the
foodstuff to Visnu, the food he cooks cannot be accepted as maha-prasada. It is
better that a Vaisnava abandon such food as untouchable.

SYNONYMS

guru-karpe—into the ear of the spiritual master; kahe—they said; sabe —all
together; krspa rama hari—the holy names of the Lord, Krsna, Rama and Hari;
cetana—consciousness; pana—getting; acarya—the teacher; bale —chanted;
hari hari—the name of Lord Hari.

TRANSLATION

When all the disciples chanted the holy names Krsna, Rama and Hari, the
Buddhist teacher regained consciousness and immediately began to chant the
holy name of Lord Hari.

PURPORT

Sri Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura comments that all the Buddhist disciples
were actually initiated by $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu to chant the holy name of
Krsna, and when they chanted, they actually became different persons. At that
time they were not Buddhists or atheists but Vaisnavas. Consequently they im-
mediately accepted Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s order. Their original Krsna con-
sciousness was revived, and they were immediately able to chant Hare Krsna and
begin worshiping the Supreme Lord Visnu.

It is the spiritual master who delivers the disciple from the clutches of maya by
initiating him into the chanting of the Hare Krsna maha-mantra. In this way a
sleeping human being can revive his consciousness by chanting Hare Krsna, Hare
Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. In
other words, the spiritual master awakens the sleeping living entity to his original
consciousness so that he can worship Lord Visnu. This is the purpose of diksa, or
initiation. Initiation means receiving the pure knowledge of spiritual conscious-
ness.

One point to note in this regard is that the spiritual master of the Buddhists did
not initiate his disciples. Rather, his disciples were initiated by Sri Krsna Caitanya
Mahaprabhu, and they in turn were able to initiate their so-called spiritual master.
This is the parampara system. The so-called spiritual master of the Buddhists was
actually in the position of a disciple, and after his disciples were initiated by 5
Caitanya Mahaprabhu, they acted as his spiritual masters. This was possible only
because the disciples of the Buddhist acarya received the mercy of Lord Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Unless one is favored by $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu in the
disciplic succession, one cannot act as a spiritual master. We should take the in-
structions of इ Caitanya Mahaprabhu, the spiritual master of the whole universe,
to understand how one becomes a spiritual master and a disciple.

336 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 9
Papanasana near the river named Tamraparni. Sri Ranga-ksetra is a very famous
place. Near Tricinapalli is a river named Kaveri, or Kolirana. A city known as Sr
Rangam is located on this river in the district of TaAjor about ten miles west of
Kumbhakonam. The ऽ Ranga temple is the largest in India, and there are seven
walls surrounding it. There are also seven roads leading to $ri Ranga. The ancient
names of these roads are the road of Dharma, the road of Rajamahendra, the road
of Kula$ekhara, the road of Alinadana, the road of Tiruvikrama, the Tirubidi road of
Madamadi-gaisa, and the road of Ada-iyavala-indana. The temple was founded
before the reign of Dharmavarma, who reigned before Rajamahendra. Many
celebrated kings like Kulasekhara, and others such as Alabandaru, resided in the
temple of ऽ Rangam. Yamunacarya, ऽ Ramanuja, Sudaranacarya and others also
supervised this temple.

The incarnation of the goddess of fortune known as Godadevi, who was one of
the twelve liberated persons known as divya-saris, was married to the Deity, Lord
$ri Ranganatha. Later she entered into the body of the Lord. An incarnation of Kar-
muka, Tirumanga (one of the Alovaras), acquired some money by stealing, and
built the fourth boundary wall of $ri Rangam. It is said that in the year 289 of the
age of Kali, the Alovara of the name Tondaradippadi was born. While engaged in
devotional service, he became victim to a prostitute, and Sri Ranganatha, seeing
His devotee so degraded, sent one of His servants with a golden plate to that
prostitute. When the golden plate was discovered missing from the temple, there
was a search, and it was found in the prostitute’s house. When the devotee saw
Ranganatha’s mercy upon this prostitute, his mistake was rectified. He then pre-
pared the third boundary wall of Ranganatha temple and cultivated a tulasi
garden there.

There was also a celebrated disciple of Ramanujacarya’s known as Karesa. Sri
Ramapillai was the son of Karesa, and his son was Vagvijaya Bhatta, whose son
was Vedavyasa Bhatta, or Sri Sudarsanacarya. When Sudarsanacarya was an old
man, the Mohammedens attacked the temple of Ranganatha and killed about
twelve hundred $ri Vaisnavas. At that time the Deity Ranganatha was transferred
to the temple of Tirupati in the kingdom of Vijaya-nagara. The governor of Gingi,
Goppanarya, brought Sri Ranganatha from the temple of Tirupati to a place
known as Sirnha-brahma, where the Lord was situated for three years. In the year
1293 Saka the Deity was again reinstalled in the Ranganatha temple. On the
eastern wall of the Ranganatha temple is an inscription written by Vedanta-desika
relating how Ranganatha was returned to the temple.

One Vaisnava known as Vyenkata Bhatta then invited Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu to his home with great respect.

6 Vyenkata Bhatta was a Vaisnava brahmana and an inhabitant of $i Ranga-
ksetra. He belonged to the disciplic succession of $fi Ramanujacarya. ऽ Ranga is
one of the places of pilgrimage in the province of Tamila-de$a. The inhabitants of
that province do not retain the name Vyenkata. It is therefore supposed that
Vyenkata Bhatta did not belong to that province, although he may have been
residing there for a very long time. Vyenkata Bhatta was in a branch of the
Ramanuja-sampradaya known as Badagala-i. He had a brother in the Ramanuja-
sampradaya known as Sripada Prabodhananda Sarasvati. The son of Vyenkata
Bhatta was later known in the Gaudiya-sampradaya as Gopala Bhatta Gosvami,
and he established the Radharamana temple in Vrndavana. More information
about him may be found in a book known as Bhakti-ratnakara (1.100) by
Narahari Cakravarti.

While reading the book, the brahmana experienced transcendental bodily
transformations. His hair stood on end, tears welled in his eyes, and his body
trembled and perspired as he read. Seeing this, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu be-
came very happy.
PURPORT
Although the brahmana could not pronounce the words very well due to il-
literacy, he still experienced ecstatic symptoms while reading Bhagavad-gita. Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu was very pleased to observe these symptoms, and this in-
dicates that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is pleased by devotion, not by
erudite scholarship. Even though the words were imperfectly pronounced, Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu, Lord Krsna Himself, did not think this very serious. Rather,
the Lord was pleased by the bhava (devotion). In $rimad-Bhagavatam (1.5.11) this
is confirmed:
tad-vag-visargo janatagha-viplavo
yasmin prati-slokam abaddhavaty api
namany anantasya yaso ‘nkitani yat
$rnvanti gayanti grnanti sadhavah
“On the other hand, that literature which is full of descriptions of the transcen-
dental glories of the name, fame, forms and pastimes of the unlimited Supreme
Lord is a different creation, full of transcendental words directed toward bringing
about a revolution in the impious lives of this world’s misdirected civilization.
Such transcendental literatures, even though imperfectly composed, are heard,
sung and accepted by purified men who are thoroughly honest.”

PURPORT

This is a good example of a person who had become so successful that he was
able to capture the attention of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu even while reading
Bhagavad-gita incorrectly. His spirityal activities did not depend on material things
such as correct pronunciation. Rather, his success depended on strictly following
the instructions of his spiritual master.

yasya deve para bhaktir
yatha deve tatha gurau
tasyaite kathita hy arthah
prakasante mahatmanah
“Only unto those great souls who have implicit faith in both the Lord and the
spiritual master are all the imports of Vedic knowledge automatically
revealed.” (Svet. Up. 6.23) ॥

Actually the meaning of the words of Bhagavad-gita or Srimad-Bhagavatam are
revealed to one strictly following the orders of the spiritual master. They are also
revealed to one who has equal faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In
other words, being faithful to both Krsna and the spiritual master is the secret of
success in spiritual life.

TRANSLATION
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu told the brihmana, ‘Indeed, you are an authority
in the reading of Bhagavad-gita. Whatever you know constitutes the real pur-
port of Bhagavad-gita.”
PURPORT
According to the $astras: bhaktya bhagavatarn grahyarn na buddhya na ca
tikaya. One should understand Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam by hearing
them from a real devotee. One cannot understand them simply by erudite schol-
arship or sharp intelligence. It is also said:
gitadhita ca yenapi
bhakti-bhavena cetasa
veda-sastra-puranani
tenadhitani sarvasah
To one who reads Bhagavad-gita with faith and devotion, the essence of Vedic
knowledge is revealed. According to the Svetasvatara Upanisad (6.23):
yasya deve para bhaktir
yatha deve tatha gurau
tasyaite kathita hy arthah
prakasante mahatmanah
All Vedic literatures are to be understood with faith and devotion, not by mun-
dane scholarship. We therefore present Bhagavad-gita As It Is. There are many so-
called scholars and philosophers who read Bhagavad-gita in a scholarly way. They
simply waste their time and mislead those who read their commentaries.

Text 117] Lord Caitanya’s Travels to the Holy Places 355
PURPORT
This is an answer to Lord $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s question, and from this we
can understand that Vyenkata Bhatta knew the truth. He told Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu that Narayana is a form of Krsna associated with transcendental opu-
lence. Although Krsna is two-armed and Narayana four-armed, there is no dif-
ference in the person. They are one and the same. Narayana.is as beautiful as
Krsna, but Krsna’s pastimes are more sportive. It is not that the sportive pastimes
of Krsna make Him different from Narayana. Laksmi’s desiring to associate with
Krsna was perfectly natural. In other words, it is understandable that a chaste
woman wants to associate with her husband in all his different dresses. Therefore
one should not criticize Laksmi for wanting to associate with Krsna.

Vyenkata Bhatta continued, * ‘According to transcendental realization,
there is no difference between the forms of Narayana and Krsna. Yet in Krsna
there is a special transcendental attraction due to the conjugal mellow, and
consequently He surpasses Narayana. This is the conclusion of transcendental
mellows.

arms, which are like serpents. Being attracted by the beauty of Krsna, the
gopis ultimately tasted the nectar of the lotus feet of the Lord. The Upanisads
have also tasted the nectar of His lotus feet by following in the footsteps of the

anyone who; karaye —does; bhajana—worship; sei jana—that person; paya—at-

‘“One who worships the Lord by following in the footsteps of the inhabi-
tants of Vrajabhiami attains the Lord and gets to know Him as He is known in
the transcendental planet of Vraja. There He is known as the son of Maharaja
Nanda.”

PURPORT

The inhabitants of Vrajabhami, or Goloka Vrndavana, know Krsna as the son of
Maharaja Nanda. They do not accept Him as the Supreme Personality of God-
head. The Lord is the supreme maintainer of everyone and the chief personality
among all personalities. In Vrajabhami Krsna is certainly the central point of love,
but no one knows Him there as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Rather, a
person may know Him as a friend, son, lover or master. In any case, the center is
Krsna. The inhabitants of Vrajabhami are related to the Lord in servitude, friend-
ship, paternal love and conjugal love. A person engaged in devotional service may
accept any one of these transcendental relationships, which are known as
mellows. One who is in the perfectional stage may return home, back to God-
head, and attain his pure spiritual identity.

engaged in spontaneous loving service, but He is not as easily accessible to
mental speculators, to those striving for self-realization by severe austerities

The authorities in Vedic literature known as sruti-gana desired to enter into Lord
Sri Krsna's rasa dance; therefore they began to worship the Lord in the ecstasy of
the gopis. In the beginning, however, they were unsuccessful. When they could
not enter the dance simply by thinking of Krsna in the ecstasy of the gopis, they
actually accepted bodies like those of the gopis. They even took birth in Vra-

the gopis’ love. In this way they were allowed to enter into the rasa-lila dance of
the Lord.

TRANSLATION
‘‘Vyasadeva, the supreme authority on Vedic literature, composed a verse
beginning ‘nayarh sukhapo bhagavan’ because no one can enter into the rasa-
lila dance in any body other than the bodies of the gopis.”
PURPORT
This verse confirms a verse of Bhagavad-gita (9.25):


--- Page 370 ---
Text 139] Lord Caitanya’s Travels to the Holy Places 367
yanti deva-vrata devan
pitin yanti pitr-vratah

“Those who worship the demigods will take birth among the demigods; those
who worship ghosts and spirits will take birth among such beings; those who
worship ancestors go the ancestors; and those who worship Me will live with
Me."

Only when one regains his original spiritual body can one enter into the
spiritual kingdom. As far as the rasa-lila pastimes of the Lord are concerned, it is
futile to attempt to imitate the Lord’s dances within the material world. One has
to attain a spiritual body like the gopis to enter into the pastimes of rasa-lila. In the
nayar sukhapo verse, the devotees are referred to as bhaktimat, that is, they are
fully engaged in devotional service and are devoid of material contamination.
Simply by artificially imitating Krsna's rasa-lila dance or artificially thinking oneself
Krsna and dressing oneself up like a sakhi, one cannot enter into His rasa-lila
dance. Krsna's rasa-lila dance is completely spiritual. It has nothing to do with ma-
terial contamination; therefore no one can enter into the pastimes by artificial ma-
terial means. That is the instruction of this verse.

four qualities are: (1) wonderful pastimes that are compared to an ocean; (2)
association in the circle of supreme devotees in conjugal love (the gopis); (3) Lord
Krsna's playing on the flute whose vibration attracts the three worlds; (4) Lord
Krsna’'s extraordinary beauty, which surpasses the beauty of the three worlds. Lord
Krsna's beauty is unequaled and unsurpassed.

‘Once Lord Sri Krsna playfully manifested Himself as Narayana with four
victorious hands and a very beautiful form. When the gopis saw this exalted
form, however, their ecstatic feelings abated. A learned scholar, therefore,
cannot understand the gopis’ ecstatic feelings, which are firmly centered
upon the original form of Lord Krsna as the son of Nanda Maharaja. The won-
derful feelings of the gopis in ecstatic parama-rasa with Krsna constitute the
greatest mystery of spiritual life.” ^

This is a verse spoken by Narada Muni in Lalita-madhava-nataka (6.14), a drama
written by Srila Rapa Gosvami. This verse clarifies the verse siddhantatas tv
abhede ‘pi, which Kavirdja Gosvami quotes from Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu. Lord
Caitanya Mahaprabhu Himself spoke it to Vyenkata Bhatta. The verse was quoted

374 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Madhya-lila, Ch. 9
by Lord Caitanya long before Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu was composed, and in this
regard Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura points out that all these verses were current at
the time and were quoted by devotees long before Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu was
composed.

eka iSvara——bhaktera dhyana-anurapa
eka-i vigrahe kare nanakara rapa
SYNONYMS

eka isvara—the Lord is one; bhaktera—of the devotees; dhyana—meditation;
anurgpa—according to; eka-i—one; vigrahe—in form; kare —exhibits; nana-
akara—different; rapa—forms.

TRANSLATION

“There is no difference between the transcendental forms of the Lord. Dif-
ferent forms are manifest due to different attachments of different devotees.
Actually the Lord is one, but He appears in different forms just to satisfy His
devotees.

PURPORT
In Brahma-sarhhita (5.33) it is stated:
advaitam acyutam anadim ananta-rapam
adyarn purana-purusam nava-yauvanari ca
The Lord is advaita, without differentiation. There is no difference between the
forms of Krsna, Rama, Narayana and Visnu. All of them are one. Sometimes foolish
people ask whether when we chant “Rama” in the Hare Krsna mantra we refer to
Lord Ramacandra or Lord Balarama. If a devotee says that the name Rama in the
Hare Krsna maha-mantra refers to Balarama, a foolish person may become angry
because to him the name Rama refers to Lord Ramacandra. Actually there is no
difference between Balarama and Lord Rama. It doesn’t matter if one chants Hare
Rama referring to Balarama or Lord Ramacandra, for there is no difference be-
tween Them. However, it is offensive to think that Balarama is superior to Lord
Ramacandra or vice versa. Neophyte devotees do not understand this $astric con-
clusion, and consequently they unneccesarily create an offensive situation. Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu clarifies this in a very lucid way: isvaratve bheda manile
haya aparadha. It is offensive for one to differentiate between the forms of the
Lord. On the other hand, one should not think that the forms of the Lord are the
same as the forms of the demigods. This is certainly offensive. As confirmed by
the Vaispava-tantra:
yas tu narayanarm devarin
brahma-rudradi-daivataih
samatvenaiva vikseta
sa pasandi bhaved dhruvam


--- Page 380 ---
Text 156] Lord Caitanya’s Travels to the Holy Places 377
“A pasandiis one who considers the great demigods such as Lord Brahma and Lord
Siva equal to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana!" (Hari-bhakti-
vilasa 1.117) The conclusion is that we should not differentiate between the
forms of the Lord. However, we should not equate the forms of the Lord with the
forms of demigods or human beings. For instance, sometimes foolish sannyasis
equate daridra-narayana with Narayana, and this is certainly offensive. To think of
the body of the Lord as material is also offensive. Unless one is instructed by a
bona fide spiritual master, he cannot perfectly understand these different forms.
Brahma-sarnhita confirms, vedesu durlabham adurlabham &tma-bhaktau. One
cannot understand the differences between the forms of the Lord simply by
academic study or by reading Vedic literature. One must leam from a realized
devotee. Only then can one learn how to distinguish between one form of the
Lord and another. The conclusion is that there is no difference between the forms
of the Lord, but there is a difference between His forms and those of the
demigods.

fallible Supreme Personality of Godhead.
TRANSLATION
^ ‘When the jewel known as vaidiirya touches other materials, it appears to
be separated into different colors. Consequently the forms also appear dif-
ferent. Similarly, according to the meditational ecstasy of the devotee, the
Lord, who is known as Acyuta [infallible], appears in different forms, although
He is essentially one.” ^“

TRANSLATION
“The transcendental pastimes of the Lord are unfathomable, and 1 do not
know anything about them. Whatever You say | accept as the truth.
PURPORT
This is the way to understand the truth about the Supreme Personality of God-
head. After hearing Bhagavad-gita, Arjuna said very much the same thing:
sarvam etad rtarh manye
yan mari vadasi kesava


--- Page 382 ---
Text 160] Lord Caitanya’s Travels to the Holy Places 379

vidur deva na danavah
“O Krsna, | totally accept as truth all that You have told me. Neither the gods nor
demons, O Lord, know Thy personality.” (Bg. 10.14) |
Vyenkata Bhatta says very much the same thing to Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. It
is not possible to understand the truth about the pastimes of the Lord simply by
using our own logic, argument and academic education. We must receive bona
fide information from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, just as Arjuna
received information when Krsna spoke Bhagavad-gita. We have to accept
Bhagavad-gita or any other Vedic literature in good faith. These Vedic literatures
are the only source of knowledge. We must understand that we cannot com-
prehend the Absolute Truth by the speculative process.

that in Bengali, as in English, spelling is not always a true indication of how a word is pro-
nounced. Tape recordings of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada

Madhya-lila (the middle period), the
longest of the three, is a detailed narration of
Sri Caitanya’s extensive and eventful travels
throughout India as a renounced mendicant,
teacher, philosopher, spiritual preceptor and
mystic. Finally, Antya-lila (the final period)
concerns the last eighteen years of Caitanya
Mahaprabhu’s manifest presence, spent in
semiseclusion in Jagannatha Puri, Orissa.
During these final years, Sri Caitanya drifted
deeper and deeper into trances of spiritual
ecstasy unparalleled in all of religious and
literary history, Eastern or Western.

Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami, the author of
Sri Caitanya-caritamrta, was a great saint and
a confidential disciple and student of
Raghunatha dasa Gosvami, the renowned
ascetic saint who was one of the most inti-
mate disciples of Sri Caitanya. He com-
menced work on the text while in his late
nineties and in failing health, as he vividly
describes in the text itself: “I have now be-
come too old and disturbed in invalidity.
While writing, my hands tremble. | cannot
remember anything, nor can | see or hear
properly. Still | write, and this is a great
wonder.” That he nevertheless completed,
under such debilitating conditions, the
greatest literary gem of medieval India is
surely one of the wonders of literary history.

The English translation and commentary is

ठ the work of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhakti-
vedanta Swami Prabhupada, the world’s
most distinguished scholar and teacher of
Indian religious and philosophical thought.
He himself is a disciplic descendant of Sri
Caitanya, and his intimate familiarity with
the precepts of Caitanya Mahaprabhu emi-
nently qualifies him to present this impor-
tant classic to the English-speaking world.
The ease and clarity with which he ex-
pounds upon Sri Caitanya’s precepts lures
even a reader totally unfamiliar with Indian
religious tradition into a genuine under-
standing and appreciation of this profound
and monumental work.

The entire text, with commentary, pre-
sented in seventeen lavishly illustrated
volumes by the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust,
represents a contribution of major impor-
tance to the intellectual, cultural and
spiritual life of contemporary man.
