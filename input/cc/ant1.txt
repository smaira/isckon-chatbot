Introduction

त Caitanya-caritamrta is the principal work on the life and teachings of rf
Krsna Caitanya. 67 Caitanya is the pioneer of a great social and religious move-
ment which began in India a little less than five hundred years ago and which has
directly and indirectly influenced the subsequent course of religious and phi-
iosophical thinking not only in India but in the recent West as well.

Caitanya Mahaprabhu is regarded as a figure of great historical significance.
However, our conventional method of historical analysis —that of seeing a man as
a product of his times —fails here. $rf Caitanya is a personality who transcends the
limited scope of historical settings.

At a time when, in the West, man was directing his explorative spirit toward
studying the structure of the physical universe and circumnavigating the world in
search of new oceans and continents, ঠা Krsna Caitanya, in the East, was in-
augurating and masterminding a revolution directed inward, toward a scientific
understanding of the highest knowledge of man’s spiritual nature.

The chief historical sources for the life of ऽन Krsna Caitanya are the kadacas (di-
aries) kept by Murari Gupta and Svardpa Damodara Gosvami. Murari Gupta, a
physician and close associate of $rf Caitanya’s, recorded extensive notes on the
first twenty-four years of इत Caitanya’s life, culminating in his initiation into the
renounced order, sannyasa. The events of the rest of Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s for-
ty-eight years are recorded in the diary of Svariipa Damodora Gosvami, another of
Caitanya Mahaprabhu'’s intimate associates.

Sri Caitanya-caritamrta is divided into three sections called /ilas, which literally
means “pastimes” — Adi-lila (the early period), Madhya-lila (the middle period)
and Antya-lila (the final period). The notes of Murari Gupta form the basis of the
Adi-1ila, and Svardpa Damodara'’s diary provides the details for the Madhya- and
Antya-lilas.

The first twelve of the seventeen chapters of Adi-lila constitute the preface for
the entire work. By referring to Vedic scriptural evidence, this preface establishes
शा Caitanya as the avatara (incarnation) of Krsna (God) for the age of Kali—the
current epoch, beginning five thousand years ago and characterized by material-
ism, hypocrisy and dissension. In these descriptions, Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who
is identical with Lord Krsna, descends to liberally grant pure love of God to the
fallen souls of this degraded age by propagating sankirtana—literally,
“congregational glorification of God” —especially by organizing massive public
chanting of the maha-mantra (Great Chant for Deliverance). The esoteric purpose
of Lord Caitanya’s appearance in the world is revealed, his co-avataras and prin-
cipal devotees are described and his teachings are summarized. The remaining
portion of Adi-lila, chapters thirteen through seventeen, briefly recounts his
divine birth and his life until he accepted the renounced order. This includes his
childhood miracles, schooling, marriage and early philosophical confrontations, as
well as his organization of a widespread sarikirtana movement and his civil disobe-
dience against the repression of the Mohammedan government.

Sri Caitanya-caritamrta

The subject of Madhya-lila, the longest of the three divisions, is a detailed nar-
ration of Lord Caitanya’s extensive and eventful travels throughout India as a
renounced mendicant, teacher, philosopher, spiritual preceptor and mystic. Dur-
ing this period of six years, ऽं Caitanya transmits his teachings to his principal dis-
ciples. He debates and converts many of the most renowned philosophers and
theologians of his time, including Sankarites, Buddhists and Muslims, and incor-
porates their many thousands of followers and disciples into his own burgeoning
numbers. A dramatic account of Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s miraculous activities at
the giant Jagannatha Cart Festival in Orissa is also included in this section.

Antya-lila concerns the last eighteen years of $rf Caitanya’s manifest presence,
spent in semiseclusion near the famous Jagannatha temple at Jagannatha Puri in
Orissa. During these final years, Sri Caitanya drifted deeper and deeper into
trances of spiritual ecstasy unparalleled in all of religious and literary history,
Eastern or Western. Sri Caitanya’s perpetual and ever-increasing religious
beatitude, graphically described in the eyewitness accounts of Svaripa Damodara
Gosvami, his constant companion during this period, clearly defy the investigative
and descriptive abilities of modern psychologists and phenomenologists of
religious experience.

The author of this great classic, Krsnadasa Kavirdja Gosvami, born in the year
1507, was a disciple of Raghunatha dasa Gosvami, a confidential follower of
Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Raghunatha dasa, a renowned ascetic saint, heard and
memorized all the activities of Caitanya Mahaprabhu told to him by Svarapa
Damodara. After the passing away of जा Caitanya and Svaripa Damodara,
Raghunatha dasa, unable to bear the pain of separation from these objects of his
complete devotion, traveled to Vindavana, intending to commit suicide by jump-
ing from Govardhana Hill. In Vrndavana, however, he encountered Ripa Gosvami
and Sanatana Gosvami, the most confidential disciples of Caitanya Mahaprabhu.
They convinced him to give up his plan of suicide and impelled him to reveal to
them the spiritually inspiring events of Lord Caitanya’s later life. Krsnadasa Kaviraja
Cosvami was also residing in Vrndavana at this time, and Raghunatha dasa
Gosvami endowed him with a full comprehension of the transcendental life of Sri
Caitanya.

By this time, several biographical works had already been written on the life of
ता Caitanya by contemporary and near-contemporary scholars and devotees.
These included $r7 Caitanya-carita by Murari Gupta, Caitanya-marigala by Locana
dasa Thakura and Caitanya-bhagavata. This latter text, a work by Vrndavana dasa
Thakura, who was then considered the principal authority on ri Caitanya’s life,
was highly revered. While composing his important work, Vindavana dasa, fearing
that it would become too voluminous, avoided elaborately describing many of
the events of Sf Caitanya's life, particulary the later ones. Anxious to hear of these
later pastimes, the devotees of Vrndavana requested Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami,
whom they respected as a great saint, to compose a book to narrate these

vii

Sri Caitanya-caritamrta
episodes in detail. Upon this request, and with the permission and blessings of the
Madana-mohana Deity of Vrndavana, he began compiling Sri Caitanya-caritamrta,
which, due to its biographical excellence and thorough exposition of Lord
Caitanya'’s profound philosophy and teachings, is regarded as the most significant
of biographical works on $ri Caitanya.

He commenced work on the text while in his late nineties and in failing health,
as he vividly describes in the text itself: “I have now become too old and dis-
turbed in invalidity. While writing, my hands tremble. | cannot remember any-
thing, nor can | see or hear properly. Still | write, and this is a great wonder.” That
he nevertheless completed, under such debilitating conditions, the greatest liter-
ary gem of medieval India is surely one of the wonders of literary history.

This English translation and commentary is the work of His Divine Grace A.C.
Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the world’s most distinguished teacher of In-
dian religious and philosophical thought. His commentary is based upon two
Bengali commentaries, one by his teacher Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami,
the eminent Vedic scholar who predicted, “The time will come when the people
of the world will learn Bengali to read $ri Caitanya-caritamrta,” and the other by
Srila Bhaktisiddhanta’s father, Bhaktivinoda Thakura.

His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada is himself a disciplic
descendant of 5 Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and he is the first scholar to execute
systematic English translations of the major works of Sr Caitanya’s followers. His
consummate Bengali and Sanskrit scholarship and intimate familiarity with the
precepts of Sri Krsna Caitanya are a fitting combination that eminently qualifies
him to present this important classic to the English-speaking world. The ease and
clarity with which he expounds upon difficult philosophical concepts lures even a
reader totally unfamiliar with Indian religious tradition into a genuine understand-
ing and appreciation of this profound and monumental work.

The entire text, with commentary, presented in seventeen lavishly illustrated
volumes by the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, represents a contribution of major im-
portance to the intellectual, cultural and spiritual life of contemporary man.

CHAPTER 1
Srila Rapa Gosvami’s
Second Meeting with the Lord
A summary of the First Chapter is given by Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura in his
Amrta-pravaha-bhasya as follows. When 67 Caitanya Mahaprabhu returned to
Jagannatha Puri from Vrndavana, all His devotees from other parts of India, upon
receiving the auspicious news, came to Purusottama-ksetra, or Jagannatha Purl.
Sivananda Sena took a dog with him and even paid fees for it to cross the river.
One night, however, the dog could not get any food and therefore went directly
to Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu at Jagannatha Puri. The next day, when Sivananda
and his party reached Jagannatha Puri, Sivananda saw the dog eating some
coconut pulp offered to it by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. After this incident, the
dog was liberated and went back home, back to Godhead.

Meanwhile, Srila Ripa Gosvami reached Bengal, after returning from
Vindavana. Although he could not follow the Bengali devotees, after some time
he then came to Jagannatha Puri, where he stayed with Haridasa Thakura. Srila
Rapa Gosvami composed an important verse, beginning with the words priyah so
‘yam, and ৩10 Caitanya Mahaprabhu relished it very much. One day when ऽ
Caitanya Mahaprabhu, Ramananda Raya and Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya went to
see Haridasa Thakura, the Lord saw the verse Ripa Gosvami had composed as an
introduction to his books Lalita-madhava and Vidagdha-madhava. After examin-
ing the manuscripts of these two books, Ramananda Raya approved and appreci-
ated them very much. After the period of Caturmasya, all the devotees who had
come from Bengal returned to their homes. Srila Rapa Gosvami, however,
remained at Jagannatha Puri for some time.

be fulfilled.
PURPORT
If one wants to benefit the entire world, he will certainly find persons like hogs
and pigs who will put forward many impediments. That is natural. But if a devotee
seeks shelter at the lotus feet of the six Gosvamis, the merciful Gosvamis will cer-
tainly give the Lord’s servitor all protection. It is not astonishing that impediments
are placed before those who are spreading the Krsna consciousness movement all
over the world. Nevertheless, if we adhere to the lotus feet of the six Gosvamis
and pray for their mercy, all impediments will be annihilated, and the transcenden-
tal devotional desire to serve the Supreme Lord will be fulfilled.

TRANSLATION
Sivananda Sena, unhappy that the dog had to stay behind, paid the boatman
ten pana of conchshells to take the dog across the river.
PURPORT
One panais eighty kadis, or small conchshells. Formerly, even fifty or sixty years
ago, there was no paper currency in India. Coins were generally made not of base
metal but of gold, silver and copper. In other words, the medium of exchange was
really something valuable. Four pieces of kadi made one ganda, and twenty such
gandas equaled one pana. This kadi was also used as a medium of exchange;
therefore Sivananda Sena paid for the dog with dasa pana, or eighty times ten
pieces of kadi. In those days one paisa was also subdivided into small conchshells,
but at the present moment the prices for commodities have gone so high that
there is nothing one can get in exchange for only one paisa. With one paisa in
those days, however, one could purchase sufficient vegetables to provide for a
whole family. Even thirty years ago, vegetables were occasionally so inexpensive
that one paisa’s worth could provide for a whole family for a day.

Text 25] Rapa Gosvami’s Meeting with the Lord 13
TRANSLATION

In the morning they looked for the dog, but it could not be found anywhere.

All the Vaisnavas were astonished.
PURPORT

Sivananda Sena’s attachment to the dog was a great boon for that animal. The
dog appears to have been a street dog. Since it naturally began to follow Sivanan-
da Sena while he was going to Jagannatha Puri with his party, he accepted it into
his party and maintained it the same way he was maintaining the other devotees.
It appears that although on one occasion the dog was not allowed aboard a boat,
Sivananda did not leave the dog behind but paid more money just to induce the
boatman to take the dog across the river. Then when the servant forgot to feed
the dog and the dog disappeared, Sivananda, being very anxious, sent ten men to
find it. When they could not find it, Sivananda observed a fast. Thus it appears
that somehow or other Sivananda had become attached to the dog.

As will be evident from the following verses, the dog got the mercy of ऽन
Caitanya Mahaprabhu and was immediately promoted to Vaikuntha to become
an eternal devotee. Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura has therefore sung, tumi ta’
thakura, tomara kukkura, baliya janaha more (Saranagati 19). He thus offers to be-
come the dog of a Vaisnava. There are many other instances in which the pet
animal of a Vaisnava was delivered back home to Vaikunthaloka, back to God-
head. Such is the benefit of somehow or other becoming the favorite of a
Vaisnava. Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura has also sung, kita-janma ha-u yatha tuya
dasa (Saranagati 11). There is no harm in taking birth again and again. Our only
desire should be to take birth under the care of a Vaisnava. Fortunately we had
the opportunity to be born of a Vaisnava father who took care of us very nicely.
He prayed to $rimati Radharani that in the future we would become a servant of
the eternal consort of 67 Krsna. Thus somehow or other we are now engaged in
that service. We may conclude that even as dogs we must take shelter of a
Vaisnava. The benefit will be the same as that which accrues to an advanced
devotee under a Vaisnava's care.

SYNONYMS
ara dina—the next day; keha—all of them; tara—of the dog; dekha na paila—
did not get sight; siddha-deha paina—obtaining a spiritual body; kukkura—the
dog; vaikunthete gela—went to the spiritual kingdom, Vaikuntha.
TRANSLATION
The next day, no one saw that dog, for it had obtained its spiritual body and
departed for Vaikuntha, the spiritual kingdom.
PURPORT
This is the result of sadhu-sanga, consequent association with $ri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu and promotion back home, back to Godhead. This result is possible
even for a dog, by the mercy of the Vaisnava. Therefore, everyone in the human
form of life should be induced to associate with devotees. By rendering a little ser-
vice, even by eating prasada, not to speak of chanting and dancing, everyone
could be promoted to Vaikunthaloka. It is therefore requested that all our devo-
tees in the ISKCON community become pure Vaisnavas, so that by their mercy all
the people of the world will be transferred to Vaikunthaloka, even without their
knowledge. Everyone should be given a chance to take prasada and thus be in-
duced to chant the holy names Hare Krsna and also dance in ecstasy. By these
three processes, although performed without knowledge or education, even an
animal went back to Godhead.

PURPORT
Formerly when a person died it was commonly said that he had attained the
shelter of mother Ganges, even if he did not die on the bank of the Ganges. It is
customary among Hindus to carry a dying person to a nearby bank of the Ganges,
for if one dies on the bank of the Ganges, his soul is considered to reach the lotus
feet of Lord Visnu, wherefrom the Ganges flows.

TRANSLATION ॥

‘ ‘The River Ganges flowing from the heavenly planets is full of golden
lotus flowers, and we, the residents of those planets, eat the stems of the
flowers. Thus we are very beautiful, more so than the inhabitants of any other
planet. This is due to the law of cause and effect, for if one eats food in the
mode of goodness, the mode of goodness increases the beauty of his body. ^

PURPORT

One's bodily luster and beauty, one’s constitution, one’s activities and one’s
qualities all depend on the law of cause and effect. There are three qualities in ma-
terial nature, and as stated in Bhagavad-gita (13.22), karanarh guna-sango ‘sya sad-
asad-yoni-janmasu: one takes birth in a good or bad family according to his pre-
vious association with the qualities of material nature. Therefore one seriously
eager to achieve transcendental perfection, Krsna consciousness, must eat Krsna
prasada. Such food is sattvika, or in the material quality of goodness, but when
offered to Krsna it becomes transcendental. Our Krsna consciousness movement
distributes Krsna prasada, and those who eat such transcendental food are sure to
become devotees of the Lord. This is a very scientific method, as stated in this
verse from Nala-naisadha (3.17): karyar nidanad dhi gunan adhite. If in all one’s
activities he strictly adheres to the mode of goodness, he will certainly develop


--- Page 49 ---
46 $ri Caitanya-caritamrta [Antya-lila, Ch. 1
his dormant Krsna consciousness and ultimately become a pure devotee of Lord
Krsna.

Unfortunately at the present moment the bodily constitutions of the leaders of
society, especially the governmental leaders, are polluted. As described in $rimad-
Bhagavatam (12.1.42);

asarnskrtah kriya-hina
rajasa tamasavrtah
prajas te bhaksayisyanti
mleccha rajany arapinah
Such leaders have no chance to purify their eating. Politicians meet together and
exchange good wishes by drinking liquor, which is so polluted and sinful that
naturally drunkards and meateaters develop a degraded mentality in the mode of
ignorance. The processes of eating in different modes are explained in Bhagavad-
gita, wherein it is stated that those who eat rice, wheat, vegetables, milk products,
fruit and sugar are situated in the elevated quality of goodness. Therefore if we
want a happy and tranquil political situation, we must select leaders who eat
Krsna prasada. Otherwise the leaders will eat meat and drink wine, and thus they
will be asarnskrtah, unreformed, and kriya-hinah, devoid of spiritual behavior. In
other words, they will be mlecchas and yavanas, or men who are unclean in their
habits. Through taxation, such men exploit the citizens as much as possible, and in
this way they devour the citizens of the state instead of benefiting them. We
therefore cannot expect a government to be efficient if it is headed by such
unclean mlecchas and yavanas.

Texts 103-104] Rapa Gosvami’s Meeting with the Lord 51
PURPORT
It is said in the Padma Purana, atah sri-krspna-namadi na bhaved grahyam in-
driyaih. Chanting and hearing of the transcendental holy name of the Lord cannot
be performed by the ordinary senses. The transcendental vibration of the Lord's
holy name is completely spiritual. Thus it must be received from spiritual sources
and must be chanted after having been heard from a spiritual master. One who
hears the chanting of the Hare Krsna mantra must receive it from the spiritual
master by aural reception. Srila Sanatana Gosvami has forbidden us to hear the
holy name of Krsna chanted by non-Vaisnavas, such as professional actors and
singers, for it will have no effect. It is like milk touched by the lips of a serpent, as
stated in the Padma Purana:
avaisnava-mukhodgirnarm
patam hari-kathamrtam
Sravaparh naiva kartavyarn
sarpocchistam yatha payah
As far as possible, therefore, the devotees in the Krsna consciousness movement
gather to chant the holy name of Krsna in public so that both the chanters and the
listeners may benefit.

Text 118] Ripa Gosvami’s Meeting with the Lord 59
TRANSLATION

‘“‘Had you not previously bestowed Your mercy on him,” they said, “it

would not have been possible for him to express Your internal feelings.”
PURPORT
Devotees acknowledge $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s special mercy upon Srila
Rapa Gosvami in the following words:
$ri-caitanya-mano ‘bhistarn
sthapitarh yena bha-tale
svayarn rapah kada mahyari
03030 sva-padantikam
“When will 5112 Ripa Gosvami Prabhupada, who has established within this ma-
terial world the mission to fulfill the desire of Lord Caitanya, give me shelter under
his lotus feet?”

The special function of Srila Ripa Gosvami is to establish the feelings of $f
Caitanya Mahaprabhu. These feelings are His desires that His special mercy be
spread throughout the world in this Kali-yuga.

prthivite ache yata nagaradi-grama
sarvatra pracara haibe mora nama

His desire is that all over the world everyone, in every village and every town,
know of 6 Caitanya Mahaprabhu and His sankirtana movement. These are the in-
ner feelings of न Caitanya Mahaprabhu. ऽ Rapa Gosvami committed to writing
all these feelings of the Lord. Now again, by the mercy of $i Caitanya
Mahaprabhu, the same feelings are being spread all over the world by the ser-
vants of the Gosvamis, and devotees who are pure and simple will appreciate this
attempt. As concluded by Srila Krsnadasa Kavirdgja Gosvami, however, those who
are on the level of hogs and dogs will never appreciate such a great attempt. Yet
this does not matter to the preachers of $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s cult, for all
over the world they will continue to perform this responsible work, even though
persons who are like cats and dogs do not appreciate them.

This verse (Vidagdha-madhava 1.2) also appears in Adi-lila (1.4 and 3.4). In his
commentary on Vidagdha-madhava, $rila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura remarks:
maha-prabhoh sphartirih vina hari-lila-rasasvadananupapatter iti bhavah. Without
the mercy ০151 Caitanya Mahaprabhu, one cannot describe the pastimes of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore Srila Rapa Gosvami said, vah

“May 6 Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who is exactly like a lion that kills all the

blessings one can understand the transcendental pastimes of Krsna.”

When $rila Ramananda Raya inquired about the arrangement for introducing the
assembly of players in the drama, Rapa Gosvami replied that when the players
first enter the stage in response to the time, the introduction is technically called
pravartaka. For an example one may consult the Antya-lila, First Chapter, verse 17.
Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura says that the introduction, which is tech-
nically called amukha, may be of five different kinds, according to the Sahitya-dar-
pana (6.288):

Introductions may be classified as follows: (1) udghatyaka, (2) kathodghata, (3)
prayogatisaya, (4) pravartaka and (5) avalagita. These five kinds of introduction are
called amukha. Thus Srila Rimananda Raya asked which of the five introductions
had been employed, and $rila Rapa Gosvami replied that he had used the in-
troduction called the pravartaka.

TRANSLATION
Ramananda Raya said, ‘Please recite the prarocana portion so that | may
hear and examine it.” Sri Rapa replied, “I think that the desire to hear of Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu is prarocana.
PURPORT
The method of inducing the audience to become more and more eager to hear
by praising the time and place, the hero and the audience is called prarocana. This
is the statement regarding prarocana in the Nataka-candrika:
desa-kala-katha-vastu-
sabhyadinari prasarnsaya
$rotfpam unmukhi-karah
kathiteyarih prarocana
Similarly the Sahitya-darpana (6.286) says:
tasyah prarocana vithi
tatha prahasana-mukhe
anganyatronmukhi-karah
prasarhsatah prarocana
Any literature presented in Sanskrit must follow the rules and regulations men-
tioned in the authoritative reference books. The technical inquiries by $rila Rama-
nanda Raya and the replies of Srila Ripa Gosvami indicate that both of them were
expert and fully conversant with the techniques of writing drama.

‘ ‘When one hears praise from his beloved, he outwardly remains neutral
but feels pain within his heart. When he hears his beloved making accusations
about him, he takes them to be jokes and enjoys pleasure. When he finds
faults in his beloved, they do not diminish his love, nor do the beloved’s good
qualities increase his spontaneous affection. Thus spontaneous love continues
under all circumstances. That is how spontaneous love of Godhead acts within

SYNONYMS
‘udghatyaka’ nama—a dancing appearance of the player, technically known as
udghatyaka; ei amukha—this is the introduction; vithi anga—the part is called
vith; tomdara age —before you; kahi—I say; iha—this; dharstyera tarariga—a
wave of impudence.
TRANSLATION
“This introduction is technically called udghatyaka, and the whole scene is
called vithi. You are so expert in dramatic expression that each of my state-
ments before you is like a wave from an ocean of impudence.
PURPORT
In this connection Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura again quotes the
following verse from the Sahitya-darpana (6.288):
udghatyakah kathodghatah
prayogatisayas tatha
pravartakavalagite
pafca prastavana-bhidah
Thus the technical names for the five kinds of introductory scenes of the drama
are listed as udghatyaka, kathodghata, prayogatisaya, pravartaka and avalagita.
When Srila Ramananda Raya inquired which of these five Srila Rapa Gosvami had
used to accomplish the technical introduction to his drama Lalita-madhava, Rapa
Gosvami replied that he had used the introduction technically called udghatyaka.
According to Bharati-vrtti, three technical terms used are prarocana, vithi and
prahasana. Thus Rapa Cosvami also mentioned vithi, which is a technical term for
a certain type of expression. According to the Sahitya-darpana (6.520):
vithyam eko bhaved arikah
kascid eko ‘tra kalpyate
akasa-bhasitair uktais
citrarm pratyuktim asritah
The vithi beginning of a drama consists of only one scene. In that scene, one of
the heroes enters the stage, and by means of opposing statements uttered by a
voice from the sky (offstage), he introduces the abundant conjugal mellow and
other mellows to some degree. In the course of the introduction, all the seeds of
the play are planted. This introduction is called udghatyaka because the player
dances on the stage. This term also indicates that the full moon enters the stage.
In this case, when the word natata (“dancing on the stage”) is linked with the


--- Page 108 ---
Text 187] Ripa Gosvami’s Meeting with the Lord 105
moon, its meaning is obscure, but because the meaning becomes very clear when
the word natatais linked with Krsna, this type of introduction is called udghatyaka.
Srila Ramananda Raya used highly technical terms when he discussed this with
Srila Rapa Gosvami. Rapa Gosvami admitted that Srila Ramananda Raya was a
greatly learned scholar of bona fide dramatic composition. Thus although Srila
Rapa Gosvami was quite fit to answer Srila Ramananda Raya’s questions, due to
his Vaisnava humility he admitted that his words were impudent. Actually both
Rapa Cosvami and Ramananda Raya were scholarly experts in composing poetry
and presenting it strictly according to the Sahitya-darpana and other Vedic
literatures.

TRANSLATION

^“ ‘The dust from cows and calves on the road creates a kind of darkness in-
dicating that Krsna is returning home from the pasture. Also, the darkness of
evening provokes the gopis to meet Krsna. Thus the pastimes of Krsna and the
gopis are covered by a kind of transcendental darkness and are therefore im-
possible for ordinary scholars of the Vedas to see.

PURPORT

This verse from the Lalita-madhava (1.23) is spoken by Paurnamasi in a conver-
sation with Gargi.

Krsna stated in Bhagavad-gita, traigunya-visaya veda nistraigunyo bhavarjuna.
Thus He advised Arjuna to rise above the modes of material nature, for the entire
Vedic system is filled with descriptions involving sattva-guna, rajo-guna and tamo-
guna. People are generally covered by the quality of rajo-guna and are therefore


--- Page 110 ---
Text 190] Rapa Gosvami’s Meeting with the Lord 107
unable to understand the pastimes of Krsna with the gopis of Vraja. Moreover, the
quality of tamo-guna further disturbs their understanding. In Vrndavana, however,
although Krsna is covered by the hazy darkness of the dust, the gopis can
nevertheless understand that within the dust storm is Krsna. Because they are His
topmost devotees, they can perceive His hand in everything. Thus even in the
dark or in a hazy storm of dust, devotees can understand what Krsna is doing. The
purport of this verse is that Krsna is never lost, under any circumstances, to the
vision of exalted devotees like the gopis.

TRANSLATION
$ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu replied, “I met Srila Rapa Gosvami at Prayaga. He
attracted and satisfied Me because of his qualities.”
PURPORT
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is not partial to some and neutral to
others. One can actually draw the attention of the Supreme Personality of God-
head by service. Then one is further empowered by the Lord to act in such a way
that everyone can appreciate his service. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita
(4.11): ye yatha mam prapadyante tams tathaiva bhajamy aham. Krsna is respon-
sive. If one tries to render his best service to the Lord, the Lord gives him the
power to do so. Krsna also says in Bhagavad-gita:
tesam satata-yuktanam
bhajatarn priti-parvakam
dadami buddhi-yogam tam
yena mam upayanti te
“To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, | give the
understanding by which they can come to Me” (Bg. 10.10) Sr Caitanya
Mahaprabhu bestowed His special favor upon Srila Rapa Gosvami because Rapa
Gosvami wanted to serve the Lord to the best of his ability. Such is the reciproca-
tion between the devotee and the Lord in the discharge of devotional duties.

‘lI empowered both of these brothers to go to Vrndavana to expand the

literature of bhakti.”
PURPORT

शा Caitanya Mahaprabhu informed Srila Ramananda Raya that he and Sanatana

Cosvami had engaged equally in devotional service after giving up all relation-

ships with material activity. Such renunciation is a symptom of an unalloyed devo-

tee engaged in the service of the Lord with no tinge of material contamination.

According to Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, this is the position of 00030 api sunicena

taror api sahispuna. A pure devotee, free from the reactions of the material modes

of nature, executes devotional service with tolerance like that of a tree. He also
feels humbler than the grass. Such a devotee, who is called niskificana, or free

Text 204] Ripa Gosvami’s Meeting with the Lord 115
from all material possessions, is always absorbed in emotional love of Godhead.
He is reluctant to perform any kind of sense gratification. In other words, such a
devotee is free from all material bondage, but he engages in Krsna conscious ac-
tivities. Such expert devotional service is performed without hypocrisy. Humility,
renunciation and learned scholarship were combined in Sanatana Gosvami, the
ideal pure devotee, who was on the same level of understanding as $rila Rama-
nanda Raya. Like Ramananda Raya, Sanatana Gosvami was a fully cognizant ex-
pert in the conclusions of devotional service and was therefore able to describe
such transcendental knowledge.

This passage parallels the statement krspa-sakti vina nahe tara pravartana, which
means that unless empowered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna,
one cannot spread the holy name of the Lord throughout the entire world
(Cc. Antya 7.11). Under the protection of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
a pure devotee can preach the holy name of the Lord so that everyone may take
advantage of this facility and thus become Krsna conscious.

PURPORT
The poet or writer dealing with transcendental subject matters is not an ordi-
nary writer or translator. Because he is empowered by the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, whatever he writes becomes very effective. The principle of being em-
powered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead is essential. A materialistic poet
who describes in his poetry the material activities of man and woman cannot de-
scribe the transcendental pastimes of the Lord or the transcendental conclusions
of devotional service. $rila Sanatana Gosvami has therefore warned all neophyte
devotees that one should not hear from the mouth of a non-Vaisnava.
avaisnava-mukhodgirpam
pata hari-kathamrtam
Sravaparn naiva kartavyarn
sarpocchistam yatha payah (Padma Purana)
Unless one is a fully unalloyed devotee of the Lord, one should not try to describe
the pastimes of Krsna in poetry, for it will be only mundane. There are many de-
scriptions of Krsna’'s Bhagavad-gita written by persons whose consciousness is
mundane and who are not qualified by pure devotion. Although they attempted
to write transcendental literature, they could not fully engage even a single devo-
tee in Krsna's service. Such literature is mundane, and therefore, as warned by ঠা
Sanatana Gosvami, one should not touch it.

CHAPTER 2
The Chastisement of Junior Haridasa
The purport of this chapter is explained by Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura in his
Amrta-pravaha-bhasya as follows. Krsnadasa Kavirdja Gosvami, the author of Sri
Caitanya-caritimrta, wanted to explain direct meetings with $f Caitanya
Mahaprabhu, meetings with those empowered by Him, and His avirbhava ap-
pearance. Thus he described the glories of Nrsirnhananda and other devotees. A
devotee named Bhagavan Acarya was exceptionally faithful to the lotus feet of Sr
Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Nevertheless, his brother, Gopala Bhatta Acarya, dis-
coursed upon the commentary of impersonalism (Mayavada). Srila 5५५३९०2
Damodara Gosvami, the secretary of 5 Caitanya Mahaprabhu, forbid Bhagavan
Acérya to indulge in hearing that commentary. Later, when Junior Haridasa, follow-
ing the order of Bhagavan Acarya, went to collect alms from Madhavidevi, he
committed an offense by talking intimately with a woman although he was in the
renounced order. Because of this, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu rejected Junior
Haridasa, and despite all the requests of the Lord's stalwart devotees, the Lord did
not accept him again. One year after this incident, Junior Haridasa went to the
confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna and committed suicide. In his spiritual
body, however, he continued to sing devotional songs, and Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu heard them. When the Vaisnavas of Bengal went to see $ri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu, these incidents became known to Svariipa Damodara and others.

Text 96] The Chastisement of Junior Haridasa 169
TRANSLATION

“When a Vaisnava listens to the Sariraka-bhasya, the Mayavada commen-
tary upon Vedania-sitra, he gives up the Krsna conscious attitude that the
Lord is the master and the living entity is His servant. Instead, he considers
himself the Supreme Lord.

PURPORT

The philosophers known as kevaladvaita-vadis generally occupy themselves
with hearing the Sariraka-bhasya, a commentary by Sankaracarya advocating that
one impersonally consider oneself the Supreme Lord. Such Mayavada philosophi-
cal commentaries upon Vedanta are simply imaginary, but there are other com-
mentaries on Vedanta philosophy. The commentary by Srila Ramanujacarya,
known as Sri-bhasya, establishes the visistadvaita-vada philosophy. Similarly, in the
Brahma-sampradaya, Madhvacarya’s Padrpaprajia-bhasya establishes suddha-
dvaita-vada. In the Kumara-sampradaya, or Nimbarka-sampradaya, ৩1] Nimbarka
establishes the philosophy of dvaitadvaita-vada in the Parijata-saurabha-bhasya.
And in the Visnusvami-sampradaya, or Rudra-sampradaya, which comes from
Lord Siva, Visnusvami has written a commentary called Sarvajfia-bhasya, which
establishes suddhadvaita-vada.

A Vaisnava should study the commentaries on Vedanta-satra written by the
four sampradaya-acaryas, namely 5 Ramanujacarya, Madhvacarya, Visnusvami
and Nimbarka, for these commentaries are based upon the philosophy that the
Lord is the master and that all living entities are His eternal servants. One in-
terested in studying Vedanta philosophy properly must study these commen-
taries, especially if he is a Vaisnava. These commentaries are always adored by
Vaisnavas. The commentary by Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati is elaborately given
in the Adi-lila, Chapter Seven, text 101. The Mayavada commentary Sariraka-
bhasya is like poison for a Vaisnava. It should not be touched at all. Srila Bhakti-
vinoda Thakura remarks that even a maha-bhagavata, or highly elevated devotee
who has surrendered himself unto the lotus feet of Krsna, sometimes falls down
from pure devotional service if he hears the Mayavada philosophy of Sariraka-
bhasya. This commentary should therefore be shunned by all Vaisnavas.

TRANSLATION
“The Mayavadi philosopher tries to establish that the living entity is only
imaginary and that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is under the influence
of maya. Hearing this kind of commentary breaks the heart and life of a devo-
tee.”
PURPORT
Srila Svaripa Damodara Gosvami wanted to impress upon Bhagavan Acarya
that even though someone firmly fixed in devotion to Krsna's service might not
be deviated by hearing the Mayavada bhasya, that bhasya is nevertheless full of
impersonal words and ideas such as Brahman which represent knowledge but
which are impersonal. The Mayavadis say that the world created by mayais false,
and that actually there is no living entity but only one spiritual effulgence. They
further say that God is imaginary, that people think of God only because of ig-
norance, and that when the Supreme Absolute Truth is befooled by the external
energy, maya, He becomes a jiva, or living entity. Upon hearing all these nonsensi-
cal ideas from the nondevotee, a devotee is greatly afflicted, as if his heart and
soul were broken.

In India sukla-caula (white rice) is also called atapa-caula, or rice that has not
been boiled before being threshed. Another kind of rice, called siddha-caula
(brown rice), is boiled before being threshed. Generally, first-class fine white rice is
required for offerings to the Deity. Thus Bhagavan Acarya asked Chota Haridasa,
or Junior Haridasa, a singer in the assembly of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, to get
some of this rice from the sister of Sikhi Mahiti. A mana is a standard of measure-
ment in Orissa for rice and other food grains.

Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura comments that saralata, or simplicity, is
the first qualification of a Vaisnava, whereas duplicity or cunning behavior is a
great offense against the principles of devotional service. As one advances in
Krsna consciousness, one must gradually become disgusted with material attach-
ment and thus become more and more attached to the service of the Lord. If one
is not factually detached from material activities but still proclaims himself ad-
vanced in devotional service, he is cheating. No one will be happy to see such
behavior.

“So strongly do the senses adhere to the objects of their enjoyment that in-

PURPORT
The senses and the sense objects are so intimately connected that the mind of
even a great saintly person is attracted to a wooden doll if it is attractively shaped
like a young woman. The sense objects, namely form, sound, smell, taste and
touch, are always attractive for the eyes, ears, nose, tongue and skin. Since the
senses and sense objects are naturally intimately related, sometimes even a per-
son claiming control over his senses remains always subject to the control of
sense objects. The senses are impossible to control unless purified and engaged in
the service of the Lord. Thus even though a saintly person vows to control his
senses, the senses are still sometimes perturbed by sense objects.

TRANSLATION
“There are many persons with little in their possession who accept the
renounced order of life like monkeys. They go here and there engaging in
sense gratification and speaking intimately with women.”
PURPORT
One should strictly follow the regulative principles, namely no illicit sex, no
meat-eating, no intoxication and no gambling, and in this way one should make
progress in spiritual life. If an unfit person sentimentally accepts vairagya or takes
sannydsa but at the same time remains attached to women, he is in a very
dangerous position. His renunciation is called markata-vairagya, or renunciation
like that of a monkey. The monkey lives in the forest, eats fruit and does not even
cover itself with a cloth. In this way it resembles a saint, but the monkey always
thinks of female monkeys and sometimes keeps dozens of them for sexual inter-
course. This is called markata-vairagya. Therefore one who is unfit should not ac-
cept the renounced order of life. One who accepts the order of sannyasa but
again becomes agitated by sensual disturbances and talks privately with women is


--- Page 184 ---
182 $ri Caitanya-caritamrta [Antya-lila, Ch. 2
called dharma-dhvaji or dharma-kalanka, which means that he brings condemna-
tion upon the religious order. Therefore one should be extremely careful in this
connection. Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura explains the word markata to
mean “restless!” A restless person cannot be steady; therefore he simply wanders
about, gratifying his senses. Just to get praise from others, to get cheap adoration
from his followers or people in general, such a person sometimes accepts the
dress of a sannyasi or babgaji in the renounced order, but he cannot give up desires
for sense gratification, especially for the association of women. Such a person can-
not make advancement in spiritual life. There are eight different kinds of sensual
enjoyment with women, induding talking about them and thinking about them.
Thus for a sannyasi, a person in the renounced order, talking intimately with
women is a great offense. $f Ramananda Raya and Srila Narottama dasa Thakura
actually achieved the most elevated stage of the renounced order, but those who
imitate them, accepting them as ordinary human beings, fall under the influence

192 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Antya-lil, Ch. 2
TRANSLATION

Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is the ocean of mercy. Who can understand Him?
When He chastises His dear devotees, He certainly does so to reestablish the
principles of religion or duty.

PURPORT

Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura says in this connection that $ri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu, the ocean of mercy, chastised Junior Haridasa, although Junior
Haridasa was His dear devotee, to establish that one in the devotional line,
engaged in pure devotional service, should not be a hypocrite. For a person
engaged in devotional service in the renounced order, having intimate relation-
ships with women is certainly hypocrisy. This chastisement was given to Junior
Haridasa as an example to future sahajiyas who might adopt the dress of the
renounced order to imitate Rapa Gosvami and other bona fide sannyasis but
secretly have illicit connections with women. To teach such men, Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu chastised His dear devotee Haridasa for a slight deviation from the
regulative principles. Srimati Madhavidevi was a ५. elevated devotee;
therefore approaching her to ask for some rice to serve Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu
was certainly not very offensive. Nevertheless, just to preserve the regulative prin-
ciples for the future, $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu enforced the hard-and-fast rule
that no one in the renounced order should intimately mix with women. Had शा
Caitanya Mahaprabhu not chastised Junior Haridasa for this slight deviation, so-
called devotees of the Lord would have exploited the example of Junior Haridasa
to continue their habit of illicit connections with women unrestrictedly. Indeed,
they still preach that such behavior is allowed for a Vaisnava. But it is strictly not
allowed. 6 Caitanya Mahaprabhu is the teacher of the entire world, and
therefore He enforced this exemplary punishment to establish that illicit sexual
connections are never allowed by Vaisnava philosophy. This was His purpose in
chastising Junior Haridasa. ऽ Caitanya Mahaprabhu is in fact the most mag-
nanimous incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but He strictly
prohibited illicit sex.

gane—among all the devotees; svapne-ha—even in dreams; chadila—gave up;

Text 146] The Chastisement of Junior Haridasa 193
TRANSLATION
After all the devotees saw this example, a mentality of fear grew among
them. Therefore they all stopped talking with women, even in dreams.
PURPORT
In connection with stri-sambhasana, talking with women, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta
Sarasvati Thakura says that talking with women for the purpose of mingling with
them for sense gratification, subtle or gross, is strictly prohibited. Canakya Pandita,
the great moral instructor, says, matrvat para-daresu. Thus not only a person in the
renounced order or one engaged in devotional service but everyone should avoid
mingling with women. One should consider another's wife his mother.

Then all the devotees, headed by Svariipa Damodara Gosvami, concluded

Ganges and Yamuna, he must have ultimately attained shelter at the lotus feet

PURPORT
Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura remarks that after one adopts the renounced order
and accepts the dress of either a sannyasi or a babgji, if he entertains the idea of
sense gratification, especially in relationship with a woman, the only atonement is
to commit suicide in the confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna. Only by such
atonement can his sinful life be purified. If such a person is thus punished, it is
possible for him to attain the shelter of जा Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Without such
punishment, however, the shelter of $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is very difficult to
regain.

TRANSLATION
Praying at the lotus feet of Sri Rapa and Sri Raghunatha, always desiring
their mercy, 1, Krsnadasa, narrate Sri Caitanya-caritamrta, following in their
footsteps.
Instructions from this Chapter
Summarizing this chapter, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura says that one
should derive from it the following lessons. (1) Although Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is an incarnation of mercy, He
nevertheless gave up the company of one of His personal associates, namely
Junior Haridasa, for if He had not done so, pseudo-devotees would have taken ad-
vantage of Junior Haridasa’s fault by using it as an excuse to live as devotees and
at the same time have illicit sexual connections. Such activities would have
demoralized the cult of ऽन Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and as a result, devotees would
surely have gone to a hellish life in the name of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. (2) By
chastising Junior Haridasa, the Lord set the standard for acaryas, or the heads of in-
stitutions propagating the Caitanya cult, and for all actual devotees. $ri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu wanted to maintain the highest standard. (3) Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu instructed that a pure devotee should be simple and free from sinful
activities, for thus one can be His bona fide servant. $i Caitanya Mahaprabhu
taught His followers how to observe the renounced order strictly. (4) $ri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu wanted to prove that His devotees are exalted and that their
character is ideal. He kindly accepts His faithful devotees and teaches them how
much tribulation and disturbance can be produced by even a slight deviation
from the strict principles of devotional life. (5) By chastising Junior Haridasa, Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu exhibited His mercy toward him, thus showing how ele-
vated was Junior 17311038535 devotion for Him. Because of this transcendental rela-
tionship, the Lord corrected even a slight offense committed by His pure devotee.
Therefore one who wants to be a pure devotee of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu
should give up all material sense gratification; otherwise, the lotus feet of Sri


--- Page 208 ---
206 $ri Caitanya-caritamrta [Antya-lila, Ch. 2
Caitanya Mahaprabhu are very difficult to attain. (6) If one dies in such a cele-
brated holy place as Prayaga, Mathura or Vrndavana, one can be relieved of the
reactions to sinful life and then attain the shelter of the Supreme Personality of
Codhead. (7) Although a pure or faithful devotee may fall down, he nevertheless
ultimately gets the chance to go back home, back to Godhead, by the mercy of
the Lord.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports to the Sri Caitanya-caritamrta, Antya-lila,
Second Chapter, describing the chastisement of Junior Haridasa.


--- Page 209 ---
CHAPTER 3
The Glories of Srila Haridasa Thakura

A summary of this Third Chapter of Antya-lila is given by Srila Bhaktivinoda
Thakura as follows. A beautiful young brahmana girl in Jagannatha Puri had a very
handsome son who was coming every day to $i Caitanya Mahaprabhu. This was
not very much to the liking of Damodara Pandita, however, who therefore told न
Caitanya Mahzprabhu, “If You display so much love for this boy, people will doubt
Your character.” Hearing these words from Damodara Pandita, the Lord sent him
to Navadvipa to supervise the affairs of His mother, Sacidevi. He also especially re-
quested Damodara Pandita to remind His mother that He was sometimes going to
her home to accept the food she offered. Thus, following the order of इत Caitanya
Mahaprabhu, Damodara Pandita went to Navadvipa, taking with him all kinds of
prasada from Lord Jagannatha.

On another occasion, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu once inquired from Haridasa
Thakura, who was known as Brahma Haridasa, how the yavanas, or persons bereft
of Vedic culture, would be delivered in Kali-yuga. Haridasa Thakura replied that
their deliverance would be possible if they very loudly chanted the Hare Krsna
mantra, for hearing the Hare Krsna mantra chanted loudly, even with but little
realization, would help them.

After describing this incident, the author of Caitanya-caritamrta also describes
how Haridasa Thakura was tested at Benapola, a village near $antipura. A person
named Ramacandra Khan, who was envious of Haridasa Thakura, sent a profes-
sional prostitute to attempt to defame him, but by the mercy of Haridasa Thakura,
even the prostitute was delivered. Because of offending a pure Vaisnava, Rama-
candra Khan was later cursed by Nityananda Prabhu and ruined.

From 89173800913, Haridasa Thakura went to the village known as Candapura,
where he lived at the house of Balarama Acarya. Thereafter, Haridasa Thakura was
received by two brothers known as Hiranya and Govardhana Majumadara, but in
the course of a discussion he was offended by a caste brahmana known 25 Gopala
Cakravarti. Because of this offense, Copala Cakravarti was punished by being
afflicted with leprosy.

Haridasa Thakura later left Candapura and went to the house of Advaita
Acarya, where he was tested by Mayadevi, the personification of the external en-
ergy. She also received his favor by being blessed with the chanting of the Hare
Krsna maha-mantra.

TRANSLATION

Damodara Pandita impudently said to the Lord, “Everyone says that You are
a great teacher because of Your instructions to others, but now we shall find
out what kind of teacher You are.

PURPORT

Damodara Pandita was a great devotee of $i Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Some-
times, however, a person in such a position becomes impudent, being influenced
by the external energy and material considerations. Thus a devotee mistakenly
dares to criticize the activities of the spiritual master or the Supreme Personality of
Codhead. Despite the logic that “Caesar's wife must be above suspicion,” a devo-
tee should not be disturbed by the activities of his spiritual master and should not
try to criticize him. A devotee should be fixed in the conclusion that the spiritual
master cannot be subject to criticism and should never be considered equal to a
common man. Even if there appears to be some discrepancy according to an im-
perfect devotee’s estimation, the devotee should be fixed in the conviction that
even if his spiritual master goes to a liquor shop, he is not a drunkard; rather, he
must have some purpose in going there. It is said in a Bengali poem:

yadyapi nityananda sura-badi yaya
tathapio haya nityananda-raya
“Even if | see that Lord Nityananda has entered a liquor shop, | shall not be
diverted from my conclusion that Nityananda Raya is the Supreme Personality of
Codhead.”

PURPORT
As a simple and staunch devotee of Lord $ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, Damodara
Pandita could not tolerate criticism of the Lord, but unfortunately he himself was
criticizing Lord Sr Caitanya Mahaprabhu in his own way. The Lord could under-
stand that it was because of Damodara Pandita’s simplicity that he impudently
dared criticize Him. Nevertheless, such behavior by a devotee is not very good.

PURPORT
Because mother Saci was feeling separation from $f Caitanya Mahaprabhu, she
thought she was dreaming that her son had come to her अआ Caitanya
Mahaprabhu, however, wanted to inform her that actually it was not a dream. He
actually came there and ate whatever His mother offered Him. Such are the deal-
ings of advanced devotees with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As stated in
the Brahma-sarmhita:
premanjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena
santah sadaiva hrdayesu vilokayanti
yam Syamasundaram acintya-guna-svarapam
govindam adi-purusam tam ahari bhajami
“I worship the primeval Lord, Govinda, who is always seen by the devotee whose
eyes are anointed with the pulp of love. He is seen in His eternal form of Syama-
sundara, situated within the heart of the devotee.” (Bs. 5.38) Pure devotees real-
ize dealings with the Lord on the transcendental plane, but because the devotees
are still in the material world, they think that these are dreams. The Lord, however,
talks with the advanced devotee, and the advanced devotee also sees Him. It is all
factual; itis not a dream.

“haridasa, kali-kale yavana apara

SYNONYMS
haridasa—My dear Haridasa; kali-kale—in this age of Kali; yavana—demons
against the Vedic principles; apara—unlimited; go-brahmane—cows and
brahminical culture; hirmsa kare—do violence against; maha duracara—extremely
fallen.
TRANSLATION
“My dear Thakura Haridasa, in this age of Kali most people are bereft of
Vedic culture, and therefore they are called yavanas. They are concerned only
with killing cows and brahminical culture. In this way they all engage in sinful
acts.
PURPORT
From this statement by 5 Caitanya Mahaprabhu we can clearly understand
that the word yavana does not refer only to a particular class of men. Anyone who
is against the behavior of the Vedic principles is called a yavana. Such a yavana
may be in India or outside of India. As described here, the symptom of yavanas is
that they are violent killers of cows and brahminical culture. We offer our prayers
to the Lord by saying, namo brahmanya-devaya go-brahmana-hitaya ca. The Lord
is the maintainer of brahminical culture. His first concern is to see to the benefit of
cows and brahmanas. As soon as human civilization turns against brahminical
culture and allows unrestricted killing of cows, we should understand that men
are no longer under the control of the Vedic culture but are all yavanas and mlec-
chas. It is said that the Krsna consciousness movement will be prominent within
the next ten thousand years, but after that people will all become mlecchas and
yavanas. Thus at the end of the yuga, Krsna will appear as the Kalki avatara and kill
them without consideration.

iha-sabara kon mate ha-ibe nistara?

SYNONYMS

iha-sabara—of all these yavanas; kon mate—by which way; ha-ibe nistara—
will be deliverance; tahara hetu—the cause of such deliverance; na dekhiye—! do
not see; e duhkha apara—it is My great unhappiness.

TRANSLATION

‘How will these yavanas be delivered? To My great unhappiness, | do not
see any ৮৭১.

PURPORT

This verse reveals the significance of Lord ऽ Caitanya’s appearance as patita-
pavana, the deliverer of all the fallen souls. Srila Narottama dasa Thakura sings,
patita-pavana-hetu tava avatara: “O my Lord, You have appeared just to deliver all
the fallen souls!” mo-sama patita prabhu na paibe ara: "And among all the fallen
souls, | am the lowest.” How $ri Krsna Caitanya Mahaprabhu was always thinking
about the deliverance of the fallen souls is shown by the statement e duhkha
apara (“It is My great unhappiness”). This statement indicates that आ Caitanya
Mahaprabhu, who is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krsna Himself, is always
very unhappy to see the fallen souls in the material world. Therefore He Himself
comes as He is, or He comes as a devotee in the form of ri Caitanya Mahaprabhu,
to deliver love of Krsna directly to the fallen souls. Namo maha-vadanyaya krsna-
prema-pradiya te. ऽ Caitanya Mahaprabhu is so merciful that He not only gives
knowledge of Krsna but by His practical activities teaches everyone how to love
Krsna (krspa-prema-pradaya te).

Those who are following in the footsteps of जा Caitanya Mahaprabhu should
take the Lord's mission most seriously. In this age of Kali, people are gradually be-
coming less than animals. Nevertheless, although they are eating the flesh of cows
and are envious of brahminical culture, अआ Caitanya Mahaprabhu is considering
how to deliver them from this horrible condition of life. Thus He asks all Indians to
take up His mission.

bharata-bhamite haila manusya-janma yara

janma sarthaka kari’ kara para-upakara
“One who has taken his birth as a human being in the land of India [Bharata-varsal
should make his life successful and work for the benefit of all other people.”
(Cc. Adi-lila 9.41) It is therefore the duty of every advanced and cultured Indian
to take this cause very seriously. All Indians should help the Krsna consciousness
movement in its progress, to the best of their ability. Then they will be considered
real followers of अ Caitanya Mahaprabhu.


--- Page 234 ---
232 $ri Caitanya-caritamrta [Antya-lila, Ch. ও

Unfortunately, even some so-called Vaisnavas enviously refuse to cooperate
with this movement but instead condemn it in so many ways. We are very sorry
to say that these people try to find fault with us, being unnecessarily envious of
our activities, although we are trying to the best of our ability to introduce the
Krsna consciousness movement directly into the countries of the yavanas and
mlecchas. Such yavanas and mlecchas are coming to us and becoming purified
Vaisnavas who follow in the footsteps of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. One who
identifies himself as a follower of 91 Caitanya Mahaprabhu should feel like Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who said, iha-sabara kon mate ha-ibe nistara: “How will all
these yavanas be delivered?” Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu was always anxious to
deliver the fallen souls because their fallen condition gave Him great unhappiness.
That is the platform on which one can propagate the mission of ण Caitanya
Mahaprabhu.

not be in anxiety; yavanera samsara—the material condition of the yavanas;
dekhi’—seeing; duhkha na bhaviha—do not be sorry.

TRANSLATION

Haridasa Thakura replied, “My dear Lord, do not be in anxiety. Do not be

unhappy to see the condition of the yavanas in material existence.
PURPORT

These words of Haridasa Thakura are just befitting a devotee who has dedi-
cated his life and soul to the service of the Lord. When the Lord is unhappy be-
cause of the condition of the fallen souls, the devotee consoles Him, saying, “My
dear Lord, do not be in anxiety.” This is service. Everyone should adopt the cause
जां Caitanya Mahaprabhu to try to relieve Him from the anxiety He feels. This is
actually service to the Lord. One who tries to relieve Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu's
anxiety for the fallen souls is certainly a most dear and confidential devotee of the
Lord. To blaspheme such a devotee who is trying his best to spread the cult of ऽ
Caitanya Mahaprabhu is the greatest offense. One who does so is simply awaiting
punishment for his envy.

“A devotee in advanced ecstatic love exclaims, ‘O my Lord Ramacandra! O

PURPORT
If a child touches fire, the fire will burn him, and if an elderly man touches fire, it
will burn him also. Haridasa Thakura says that a great devotee of the Lord ex-
claims, “03 rama, ha rama,” but although yavanas do not know the transcendental


--- Page 236 ---
234 $ri Caitanya-caritamrta [Antya-lila, Ch. 3
meaning of “ha rama, ha rama,” they say those words in the course of their ordi-
nary life. For the yavanas the words “ha rama” mean “abominable,” whereas the
devotee exclaims the words “ha rama” in ecstatic love. Nevertheless, because the
words “ha rama” are the spiritual summum bonum, the fact is the same, whether
they are uttered by yavanas or by great devotees, just as fire is the same both for a
child and for an elderly man. In other words, the holy name of the Lord, “ha rama,”
always acts, even when the holy names are chanted without reference to the
Supreme Lord. Yavanas utter the holy name in a different attitude than devotees,
but the holy name “ha rama” is so powerful spiritually that it acts anywhere,
whether one knows it or not. This is explained as follows.

TRANSLATION

^“ ‘Even > mleccha who is being killed by the tusk of a boar and who cries in
distress again and again, “ha rama, ha rama’’ attains liberation. What then to
speak of those who chant the holy name with veneration and faith?’

PURPORT

This refers to an instance in which a meateater being killed by a boar uttered
the words “ha rama, ha rama’ again and again at the time of his death. Since this is
a quotation from the Nrsirhha Purana, this indicates that in the puranic age there
must also have been mlecchas and yavanas (meateaters), and the words “ha
rama,” meaning “condemned,” were also uttered in those days. Thus Haridasa
Thakura gives evidence that even a meateater who condemns something by ut-
tering the words “ha rama” gets the benefit of chanting the holy name that the
devotee chants to mean “O my Lord Rama.”

Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura states that the word vyavahita

letters of the alphabet. Such negligent utterance for the sense gratification of ma-
terialistic persons is not a vibration of transcendental sound. Utterance of the holy

Text 60] The Glories of Haridasa Thakura 237
name while one engages in sense gratification is an impediment on the path
toward achieving ecstatic love for Krsna. On the other hand, if one who is eager
for devotional service utters the holy name even partially or improperly, the holy
name, who is identical with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, exhibits its
spiritual potency because of that person's offenseless utterance. Thus one is
relieved from all unwanted practices, and one gradually awakens his dormant love
for Krsna.

name with offenses —such chanting will not produce the desired result very
soon. Therefore one should diligently avoid offenses in chanting the holy
name of the Lord.” ^
PURPORT

This verse from the Padma Purana is included in the Hari-bhakti-vilasa (11.527)
by Sanatana Gosvami. Therein Srila Sanatana Gosvami gives the following <<
planation:

vaci gatam prasargad van-madhye pravrttam api, smarana-patha-gatam kathancin
manah-sprstam api, srotra-malam gatam kificit Srutam api; Suddha-varpari va asuddha-
varpam api va; ‘vyavahitam’ $abdantarena yad-vyavadhanam vaksyamana-narayana-sab-
dasya kificid uccarananantaram prasarigad apatitarh $abdantaram tena rahitam sat.
This means that if one somehow or other hears, utters or remembers the holy
name, or if it catches his mind while coming near his ears, that holy name, even if
vibrated in separate words, will act. An example of such separation is given as
follows:

yadva, yadyapi ‘halam riktam’ ity ady-uktau hakara-rikarayor vrttya hariti-namasty eva,
tatha ‘raja-mahisi’ ity atra rama-namapi, evam anyad apy ohyam, tathapi tat-tan-nama-

evar rapa, madhye Sabdantarenantaritam ity arthah, ‘rahitarh’ pascad avasistaksara-
grahana-varjitar, kenacid amsena hinam ity arthah, tathapi tarayaty eva.
Suppose one is using the two words “halam riktam.” Now the syllable ha in the
word “halam” and the syllable ri in “riktam” are separately pronounced, but
nevertheless it will act because one somehow or other utters the word “hari.”
Similarly, in the word “raja-mabhisi;" the syllables ra and ma appear in two separate
words, but because they somehow or other appear together, the holy name rama
will act, provided there are no offenses.

sarvebhyah papebhyo ‘paradhebhyas ca samsarad apy uddharayaty eveti satyam eva;
kintu nama-sevanasya mukhyam yat phalam, tan na sadyah sampadyate. tatha deha-

The holy name has so much spiritual potency that it can deliver one from all sinful
reactions and material entanglements, but utterance of the holy name will not be
very soon fruitful if done to facilitate sinning.

10 this way all moving and nonmoving living entities will come into exis-

PURPORT
While we are preaching, opposing elements sometimes argue, “If all living en-
tities were delivered by the Krsna consciousness movement, what would happen
then? The universe would be devoid of living entities.” In answer to this, we may
say that in a prison there are many prisoners, but if one thinks that the prison
would be empty if all the prisoners adopted good behavior, he is incorrect. Even if
all the prisoners within a jail are freed, other criminals will fill it again. A prison will
never be vacant, for there are many prospective criminals who will fill the prison
cells, even if the present criminals are freed by the government. As confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita, karanarh guna-sarngo ‘sya sad-asad-yoni-janmasu: “Because of the
living entity's association with material nature, he meets with good and evil
among various species.” (Bg. 13.22) There are many unmanifested living entities
covered by the mode of ignorance who will gradually come to the mode of pas-
sion. Most of them will become criminals because of their fruitive activities and
again fill the prisons.

258 $ri Caitanya-caritamrta [Antya-hla, Ch. 3
PURPORT

The village of Benapola is situated in the district of Yasohara, which is now in
Bangladesh. Benapola is near the Banagano station, which is at the border of
Bangladesh and may be reached by the eastern railway from Shelda Station in
Calcutta. Haridasa Thakura, being the acarya of chanting the Hare Krsna maha-
mantra, is called Namacarya Haridasa Thakura. From his personal example we can
understand that chanting the Hare Krsna mantra and becoming highly elevated in
Krsna consciousness is very simple. Without difficulty one can sit down any-
where, especially on the bank of the Ganges, Yamuna or any sacred river, devise a
sitting place or cottage, plant a tulasi, and before the tulasi chant the Hare Krsna
maha-mantra undisturbed.

Haridasa Thakura used to chant the holy name on his beads 300,000 times
daily. Throughout the entire day and night, he would chant the sixteen names of
the Hare Krsna maha-mantra. One should not, however, imitate Haridasa Thakura,
for no one else can chant the Hare Krsna maha-mantra 300,000 times a day. Such
chanting is for the mukta-purusa, or liberated soul. We can follow his example,
however, by chanting sixteen rounds of the Hare Krsna maha-mantra on beads
every day and offering respect to the tulasiplant. This is not at all difficult for any-
one, and the process of chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra with a vow before
the tulasi plant has such great spiritual potency that simply by doing this one can
become spiritually strong. Therefore we request the members of the Hare Krsna
movement to follow Haridasa Thakura's example rigidly. Chanting sixteen rounds
does not take much time, nor is offering respects to the tulasi plant difficult. The
process has immense spiritual potency. One should not miss this opportunity.

vahana—asking alms of food; prabhave—by spiritual potency; sakala loka—all
peoplé; karaye pajana—worship.

TRANSLATION

For his bodily maintenance he would go to a brahmana’s house and beg
some food. He was spiritually so influential that all the neighboring people
worshiped him.


--- Page 261 ---
Text 103] The Glories of Haridasa Thakura 259
PURPORT
In the days of Haridasa Thakura, all the brahmanas worshiped Narayana in the
form of the salagrama-sila. Therefore begging from a brahmana’s house meant
taking krsna-prasada, which is transcendental (nirguna). If we take food from the
house of others, such as karmis, we shall have to share the qualities of those from
whom we take alms. Therefore Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu took prasada in the
houses of Vaisnavas. This is the general process. The members of the Krsna con-
sciousness movement are advised not to take food from anywhere but a
Vaisnava's or brahmana’s house where Deity worship is performed. ऽप Caitanya
Mahaprabhu has said, visayira anna khaile dusta haya mana: if a devotee takes
alms or food from the house of a karmi who is simply interested in money, his
mind will be unclean. We must always remember that a devotee’s life is one of
vairagya-vidya, or renunciation and knowledge. Therefore all devotees are
warned not to live unnecessarily luxurious lives at the cost of others. Grhasthas
living within the jurisdiction of the temple must be especially careful not to imi-
tate karmis by acquiring opulent clothing, food and conveyances. As far as possi-
ble, these should be avoided. A member of the temple, whether grhastha,
brahmacari or sannyasi, must practice a life of renunciation, following in the
footsteps of Haridasa Thakura and the six Gosvamis. Otherwise, because maya is
very strong, at any time one may become a victim of maya and fall down from
spiritual life.

nahi—not; paya—gets; vesya-gane—prostitutes; ani’—bringing; kare —makes;
chidrera updya—a means to find some fault.
TRANSLATION
By no means could he find any fault in the character of Haridasa Thakura.
Therefore he called for local prostitutes and began a plan to discredit His
Holiness.
PURPORT
This is typical of atheistic men, but even among so-called religionists, sadhus,
mendicants, sannyasis and brahmacaris, there are many enemies of the Krsna con-
sciousness movement who always try to find faults in it, not considering that the
movement is spreading automatically by the grace of Lord अ Caitanya
Mahaprabhu, who wanted it spread all over the world, in every town and village.
We are trying to fulfill the Lord's desire, and our attempt has become fairly suc-
cessful, but the enemies of this movement unnecessarily try to find faults in it, ex-
actly like the old rascal Ramacandra Khan, who opposed Haridasa Thakura.

SYNONYMS
vedya-gane—unto the prostitutes; kahe —said; ei—this; vairagi—mendicant;
haridasa—Haridasa Thakura; tumi-saba—all of you; kara—cause; ihara—his;
vairagya-dharma—from the life of a mendicant; nasa—deviation.
TRANSLATION
Ramacandra Khan said to the prostitutes, ‘There is a mendicant named
Haridasa Thakura. All of you devise a way to deviate him from his vows of
austerity.”
PURPORT
Devotional service is the path of vairagya-vidya (renunciation and knowledge).
Haridasa Thakura was following this path, but Ramacandra Khan planned to in-
duce him to break his vows. Renunciation means renunciation of sensual pleasure,
especially the pleasure of sex. Therefore a brahmacari, sannyasi or vanaprastha is
strictly prohibited from having relationships with women. Haridasa Thakura was
strictly renounced, and thus Ramacandra Khan called for prostitutes because
prostitutes know how to break a man’s vow of celibacy by their feminine in-
fluence and thus pollute a mendicant or a person engaged in devotional life. It
was impossible for Rimacandra Khan to induce any other women to break
Haridasa Thakura's vow, and therefore he called for prostitutes. Free mingling with
women has never been possible in India, but for one who wanted to associate
with society girls, they were available in a district of prostitutes. There were
prostitutes in human society even in Lord Krsna's time, for it is said that the
prostitutes of Dvaraka City came forth to receive the Lord. Although they were
prostitutes, they were also devotees of Krsna.

TRANSLATION

After offering her obeisances to the tulasi plant and Haridasa Thakura, she
sat down at the door. Hearing Haridasa Thakura chanting the Hare Krsna
mantra, she also chanted, ““O my Lord Hari, O my Lord Hari.”

PURPORT

Herein one can clearly see how a Vaisnava delivers a fallen soul by a transcen-
dental trick. The prostitute came to pollute Haridasa Thakura, but he took it as his
duty to deliver the prostitute. As clearly demonstrated here, the process of
deliverance is very simple. With faith and reverence the prostitute associated with
Haridasa Thakura, who personally treated her material disease by chanting the
Hare Krsna maha-mantra. Although the prostitute had an ulterior motive, some-
how or other she got the association of a Vaisnava and satisfied him by occa-
sionally chanting in imitation, “O my Lord Hari, O my Lord Hari.” The conclusion is
that associating with a Vaisnava, chanting the holy name of the Lord and offering
obeisances to the tulasi plant or a Vaisnava all lead one to become a transcenden-
tal devotee who is completely cleansed of all material contamination.

TRANSLATION
“I have vowed to chant ten million names in a month. I have taken this vow,

PURPORT
If one regularly chants 333,333 times daily for a month and then chants one
time more, he will thus chant ten million times. In this way a devotee worships the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such worship is called yajia. Yajiaih sarikirtana-
prayair yajanti hi sumedhasah: those whose intelligence is brilliant accept this
hari-nama-yajia, the yajia of chanting the holy name of the Lord. By performing
this yajia, one satisfies the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus attains per-
fection in spiritual life.


--- Page 272 ---
270 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Antya-lila, Ch. 3
According to external vision, Haridasa Thakura belonged to a Mohammedan
family. Nevertheless, because he engaged himself in performing the yajia of
chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra, he became a regularly initiated brahmana.

Even if a devotee comes from a family of dog-eaters, if he surrenders to the Per-
sonality of Godhead he immediately becomes a qualified brahmana and is im-
mediately fit to perform yajia, whereas a person born in a family of brahmanas
has to wait until completing the reformatory processes before he may be called
৩3/85/0003, purified. It is further said in Srimad-Bhagavatam (12.1.42):
asarnskrtah kriya-hina
rajasa tamasavrtah
prajas te bhaksayisyanti
mleccha rajanya-rapinah
“In the age of Kali, mlecchas, or lowborn people who have not undergone the
purifying process of sarnskara, who do not know how to apply that process in ac-
tual life and who are covered by the modes of passion and ignorance, will take
the posts of administrators. They will devour the citizens with their atheistic ac-
tivities!” A person who is not purified by the prescribed process of samskara is
called asariskrta, but if one remains kriya-hina even after being purified by initia-
tion—in other words, if one fails to actually apply the principles of purity in his
life—he remains an unpurified mleccha or yavana. On the other hand, we find
that Haridasa Thakura, although born in a mleccha or yavana family, became
14317730313 Haridasa Thakura because he performed the nama-yajia a minimum
of 300,000 times every day.

Herein we find that Haridasa Thakura strictly followed his regulative principle of
chanting 300,000 times. Thus when the prostitute became restless, he informed
her that first he had to finish his chanting and then he would be able to satisfy her.
Actually Haridasa Thakura chanted the holy name of the Lord for three nights
continuously and gave the prostitute a chance to hear him. Thus she became
purified, as will be seen in the following verses.

“Tomorrow | will surely finish, and my vow will be fulfilled. Then it will be

PURPORT

Haridasa Thakura never wanted to enjoy the prostitute, but he tricked her to
deliver her by giving her a chance to hear the holy name of the Lord while he
chanted. Pure devotees chant the Hare Krsna mantra, and simply by hearing this
chanting from a purified transcendental person, one is purified of all sinful ac-
tivities, no matter how lowborn or fallen one may be. As soon as one is thus com-
pletely free from the reactions of sinful activities, he is eligible to render devo-
tional service to the Lord. This is the process for engaging the fallen souls in devo-
tional service. As Lord Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (7.28):

TRANSLATION
Haridasa Thakura replied, “Immediately go home and distribute to the
brihmanas whatever property you have. Then come back to this room and
stay here forever in Krsna consciousness.
PURPORT
Haridasa Thakura’s instruction that the prostitute should distribute to the
brahmanas all the property she had at home is very significant. Haridasa Thakura
never advised the prostitute to give charity to the so-called daridra-narayana
(“poor Narayana’) or any other such persons. According to Vedic civilization,
charity should be given only to the qualified brahmanas. As stated in Bhagavad-
gita (18.42):
samo damas tapah saucarh
ksantir arjavam eva ca
jAdnam vijidanam astikyam
brahma-karma svabhava-jam
The brahminical qualifications are truthfulness, control of the senses and mind,
tolerance, simplicity, knowledge, practical application of transcendental knowl-
edge in one’s life, and full faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Persons
engaged in pursuing spiritual understanding have no time to earn their livelihood.
They depend completely on the mercy of the Lord, who says in Bhagavad-gita
(9.22) that He personally carries to them all their necessities (yoga-ksemam


--- Page 279 ---
Text 137] The Glories of Haridasa Thakura 277
vahamy aham). The Vedic civilization recommends that one give charity to
brahmanas and sannyasis, not to the so-called daridra-narayana. Narayana cannot
be daridra, nor can daridra be Narayana, for these are contradictory terms.
Atheistic men invent such concoctions and preach them to fools, but charity
should actually be given to brahmanas and sannyasis because whatever money
they get they spend for Krsna. Whatever charity one gives to a brahmana goes to
Krsna, who says in Bhagavad-gita (9.27):
yat karosi yad asnasi
yaj juhosi dadasi yat
yat tapasyasi kaunteya
tat kurusva mad-arpanam
“O son of Kuntj, all that you do, all that you eat, all that you offer and give away,
as well as all austerities that you may perform, should be done as an offering unto
Me." Everything actually belongs to Krsna, but so-called civilized men unfor-
tunately think that everything belongs to them. This is the mistake of materialistic
civilization. The prostitute (vesya) had earned money by questionable means, and
therefore Haridasa Thakura advised her to distribute to the brahmanas whatever
she possessed. When Srila Rapa Gosvami retired from family life, he distributed
fifty percent of his income to the brahmanas and Vaisnavas. A brahmana knows
what the Absolute Truth is, and a Vaisnava, knowing the Absolute Truth, acts on
behalf of the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Generally one
earns money by many questionable means. Therefore at some time one should
retire and distribute whatever one has to the brahmanas and Vaisnavas who
engage in devotional service by preaching the glories of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead.

pabe—you will get; tabe—then; krsnera carana—the lotus feet of Krsna.

278 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Antya-lila, Ch. 3
TRANSLATION

“Chant the Hare Krsna mantra continuously and render service to the tulasi
plant by watering her and offering prayers to her. In this way you will very
soon get the opportunity to be sheltered at the lotus feet of Krsna.”

PURPORT

At least five thousand years ago, Lord Sri Krsna expressed His desire that every-
one surrender to Him (sarva-dharman parityajya mam eka saraparm vraja). Why is
it that people cannot do this? Krsna assures, aha tvam sarva-papebhyo mok-
sayisyami ma sucah: 4 shall deliver you from all sinful reactions. Do not fear.”
Everyone is suffering from the results of sinful activities, but Krsna says that if one
surrenders unto Him, He will protect one from sinful reactions. Modern civiliza-
tion, however, is interested neither in Krsna nor in getting relief from sinful acts.
Therefore men are suffering. Surrender is the ultimate instruction of Bhagavad-
gita, but for one who cannot surrender to the lotus feet of Krsna, it is better to
chant the Hare Krsna mantra constantly, under the instruction of Haridasa
Thakura.

In our Krsna consciousness movement we are teaching our followers to chant
the Hare Krsna mantra continuously on beads. Even those who are not ac-
customed to this practice are advised to chant at least sixteen rounds on their
beads so that they may be trained. Otherwise, rT Caitanya Mahaprabhu recom-
mended:

trnad api sunicena
taror api sahisnuna
amanina manadena
kirtaniyah sada harih
“One should chant the holy name of the Lord in a humble state of mind, thinking
oneself lower than the straw in the street. One should be more tolerant than a
tree, devoid of all sense of false prestige, and ready to offer all respect to others. In
such a state of mind one can chant the holy name of the Lord constantly.” Sada
means “always.” Haridasa Thakura says, nirantara nama lao: “Chant the Hare Krsna
mantra without stopping.”

Although Krsna wants everyone to surrender to His lotus feet, because of
people’s sinful activities they cannot do this. Na mam duskrtino madhah prapa-
dyante naradhamah: rascals and fools, the lowest of men, who engage in sinful ac-
tivities, cannot suddenly surrender to the lotus feet of Krsna. Nevertheless, if they
begin chanting the Hare Krsna mantra and rendering service unto the tulasi plant,
they will very soon be able to surrender. One's real duty is to surrender to the
lotus feet of Krsna but if one is unable to do so, he should adopt this process, as
introduced by ঠা Caitanya Mahaprabhu and His most confidential servant,

tabe —thereafter; sei —that; vesya—prostitute; gurura—of the spiritual master;
ajfia—order; la-ila—took; grha-vitta—all household possessions; yeba—what-
ever; chila—there was; brahmanere—to the brahmanas; dila—gave.
TRANSLATION
Thereafter, the prostitute distributed to the brahmanas whatever household
possessions she had, following the order of her spiritual master.
PURPORT
Sometimes the word grha-vrtti is substituted for the word grha-vitta. Vrtti
means “profession.” The grha-vrtti of the prostitute was to enchant foolish people
and induce them to indulge in sex. Here, however, grha-vrtti is not a suitable


--- Page 282 ---
280 $ri Caitanya-caritamrta [Antya-lila, Ch. 3
word. The proper word is grha-vitta, which means “all the possessions she had in
her home!” All the girl's possessions had been earned by professional prostitution
and were therefore products of her sinful life. When such possessions are given to
brahmanas and Vaisnavas who can engage them in the service of the Lord be-
cause of their advancement in spiritual life, this indirectly helps the person who
gives the charity, for he is thus relieved of sinful reactions. As Krsna promises,
ahari tvarn sarva-papebhyo moksayisyami: ^| shall save you from all sinful reac-
tions!” When our Krsna conscious devotees go out to beg charity or collect con-
tributions in the form of membership fees, the money thus coming to the Krsna
consciousness movement is strictly employed to advance Krsna consciousness all
over the world. The Krsna conscious devotees collect the money of others for the
service of Krsna, and they are satisfied with Krsna's prasada and whatever He gives
them for their maintenance. They do not desire material comforts. However, they
go to great pains to engage the possessions of prostitutes, or persons who are
more or less like prostitutes, in the service of the Lord and thus free them from sin-
ful reactions. A Vaisnava guru accepts money or other contributions, but he does
not employ such contributions for sense gratification. A pure Vaisnava thinks him-
self unfit to help free even one person from the reactions of sinful life, but he
engages one’s hard-earned money in the service of the Lord and thus frees one
from sinful reactions. A Vaisnava guru is never dependent on the contributions of
his disciples. Following the instructions of Haridasa Thakura, a pure Vaisnava does
not personally take even a single paisa from anyone, but he induces his followers
to spend for the service of the Lord whatever possessions they have.

Thus the prostitute became a celebrated devotee. She became very ad-

PURPORT
Stalwart, highly advanced Vaisnava devotees are not interested in seeing
prostitutes, but when a prostitute or any other fallen soul becomes a Vaisnava,
stalwart Vaisnavas are interested in seeing them. Anyone can be turned into a

Vaisnava if he or she follows the Vaisnava principles. A devotee who follows
these principles is no longer on the material platform. Therefore, it is one’s strict
adherence to the principles that should be considered, not the country of one’s
birth. Many devotees join our Krsna consciousness movement from Europe and
America, but one should not therefore consider them European Vaisnavas or
American Vaisnavas. A Vaisnava is a Vaisnava and should therefore be given all
the respect due a Vaisnava.

TRANSLATION
Seeing the sublime character of the prostitute, everyone was astonished.
Everyone glorified the influence of Haridasa Thakura and offered him obei-
sances.
PURPORT
It is said, phalena pariciyate: one is recognized by the result of his actions. In
Vaisnava society there are many types of Vaisnavas. Some of them are called
gosvamis, some are called svamis, some are prabhus, and some are prabhupada.
One is not recognized, however, simply by such a name. A spiritual master is rec-
ognized as an actual guru when it is seen that he has changed the character of his
disciples. Haridasa Thakura actually changed the character of the professional
prostitute. People greatly appreciated this, and therefore they all offered obei-
sances to Haridasa Thakura and glorified him.

Ramacandra Khan was a great offender at the lotus feet of the Vaisnavas and
Visnu. Just as Ravana, although born of a brahmana father, Viévasrava, was
nevertheless called an asura or raksasa because of his offenses against Lord Rama-
candra (Visnu) and Hanuman (a Vaisnava), so Ramacandra Khan also became such
an asura because of his offenses against Haridasa Thakura and many others.

paritranaya sadhanam
vinasaya ca duskrtam

sarhbhavami yuge yuge
Lord Krsna appears in every millennium for two purposes, namely to deliver the
devotees and kill the nondevotees. His devotees also have two similar purposes —
to preach the bhakti cult of Krsna consciousness and defeat all kinds of agnostics
and atheistic demons. Nityananda Prabhu carried out the order of Lord Sr
Caitanya Mahaprabhu in this way, and those who strictly follow Nityananda


--- Page 288 ---
286 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Antya-lila, Ch. 3
Prabhu perform the same activities. There are two classes of devotees. One is
called gosthyanandi, and the other is called bhajananandi. A devotee who does
not preach but always engages in devotional activities is called a bhajananandi,
whereas a devotee who not only is expert in devotional service but who also
preaches the cult of bhakti and defeats all kinds of agnostics is called a gosthya-
nandi.

TRANSLATION
When the Durga-mandapa and courtyard were filled with crowds of men,
Ramacandra Khan, who was inside the house, sent his servant to Lord Nitya-
nanda.
PURPORT
In those days, and also even now, the palatial buildings of respectable people,
expecially in the villages of Bengal, were divided into two parts. The inside part
was especially meant for the family, and the ladies would live there unexposed to
men. That part was called the bhitara-badi, or inside house. In the outside house,
or bahir-badl, the respectable gentleman received visitors and kept his business
office. The Durga-mandapa would be part of the outside house. Thus when Lord
Nityananda entered the outside house, Ramacandra Khan was in the inside house
with the members of his family. When Nityananda Prabhu arrived, Ramacandra
Khan did not receive Him personally but sent his servant to inform Him indirectly
to go away.

chants the holy name. He also laughs, cries, becomes agitated and chants just
like a madman, not caring for outsiders.’

TRANSLATION
He had handsome bodily features, and he was learned and youthful, but he
could not tolerate the statement that simply by glimpsing the awakening of
the Lord’s holy name one can attain liberation.
PURPORT
Vaisnavas strictly follow the directions of the sastras regarding how one can be
liberated simply by a slight awakening of pure chanting of the holy name.
Mayavadis cannot tolerate the statements of the sastras about how easily libera-
tion can be achieved, for as stated in Bhagavad-gita (12.5), kleso ‘dhikaratas tesam
avyaktasakta-cetasam: impersonalists must work hard for many, many births, and
only then will they perhaps be liberated. Vaisnavas know that simply by chanting
the holy name of the Lord offenselessly, one achieves liberation as a by-product.
Thus there is no need to endeavor separately for liberation. Srila Bilvamangala
Thakura has said, muktih svayarh mukulitarijali sevate ‘sman: liberation stands at
one’s door, ready to render any kind of service, if one is a pure devotee with
unflinching faith and reverence. This the Mayavadis cannot tolerate. Therefore
the arinda pradhana, chief tax collector, although very learned, handsome and
youthful, could not tolerate the statements of Haridasa Thakura.

The philosophy enunciated by the Mayavadrs is called ghata-patiya philosophy.
According to this philosophy, everything is one, everything is earth, and therefore
anything made of earth, such as different pots, is also the same earth. Such phi-
losophers see no distinction between a pot made of earth and the earth itself.
Since Gopala Cakravarti was a ghata-patiya logician, a gross materialist, what
could he understand about the transcendental devotional service of the Lord?

“All of you may now go to your homes. May Lord Krsna bestow his blessings

PURPORT
From this statement by Haridasa Thakura, it is understood that a pure Vaisnava
never takes anyone's insults seriously. This is the teaching of গা Caitanya
Mahaprabhu:
trnad api sunicena
taror api sahisnuna
amanina manadena
kirtaniyah sada harih
“One should chant the holy name of the Lord in a humble state of mind, thinking
oneself lower than the straw in the street. One should be more tolerant than a
tree, devoid of all sense of false prestige and ready to offer all respects to others.
In such a state of mind one can chant the holy name of the Lord constantly.” A
Vaisnava is always tolerant and submissive like trees and grass. He tolerates insults
offered by others, for he is simply interested in chanting the holy name of the Lord
without being disturbed.

TRANSLATION
A characteristic of a pure devotee is that he excuses any offense by an ig-
norant rascal. The characteristic of Krsna, however, is that He cannot tolerate
blasphemy of His devotees.
PURPORT
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu taught:
00030 api sunicena
taror api sahisnuna
amanina manadena
kirtaniyah sada harih
A Vaisnava strictly follows this principle of being humbler than the grass and more
tolerant than a tree, expecting no honor from others but offering honor to every-
one. In this way, a Vaisnava is simply interested in chanting about the Supreme
Personality of Godhead and glorifying Him. Haridasa Thakura epitomized this
foremost order of Vaisnavism. Krsna cannot tolerate any insults or blasphemy
against a Vaisnava. For example, Prahlada Maharaja was chastised by his father,
Hiranyakasipu, in so many ways, but although Prahlada tolerated this, Krsna did
not. The Lord therefore came in the form of Nrsirhhadeva to kill Hiranyakasipu.
Similarly, although Srila Haridasa Thakura tolerated the insult by Gopala Cakravarti,
Krsna could not. The Lord immediately punished Gopala Cakravarti by making him
suffer from leprosy. While instructing Srila Rapa Gosvami about the many restric-
tive rules and regulations for Vaisnavas, $f Caitanya Mahaprabhu has very vividly
described the effects of offenses at the lotus feet of a Vaisnava. Yadi vaisnava-
aparadha uthe hati mata (Madhya 19.156). Offending or blaspheming a Vaisnava


--- Page 319 ---
Text 215] The Glories of Haridasa Thakura 317
has been described as the greatest offense, and it has been compared to a mad
elephant. When a mad elephant enters a garden, it ruins all the creepers, flowers
and trees. Similarly, if a devotee properly executing his devotional service be-
comes an offender at the lotus feet of his spiritual master or a Vaisnava, his devo-
tional service is spoiled.

TRANSLATION

““My dear sir, Your behavior is uncommon. Indeed, sometimes | am afraid to
speak to You. But please favor me by protecting me from the behavior of
society.”

PURPORT

While Haridasa Thakura was staying under the care of Advaita Acarya, he was
afraid of the behavior of society in Santipura, Navadvipa, which was full of ex-
ceedingly aristocratic brahmanas, ksatriyas and vaisyas. Haridasa Thakura was
born in a Mohammedan family and was later recognized as a great Vaisnava, but
nevertheless the brahmanas were very critical of him. Thus Haridasa Thakura was
afraid that Advaita Acirya would be put into some difficulty because of His
familiarity with Haridasa Thakura. जा Advaita Acarya treated Haridasa Thakura as a
most elevated Vaisnava, but others, like Ramacandra Khan, were envious of
Haridasa Thakura. Of course, we have to follow in the footsteps of Advaita
Acarya, not caring for people like Ramacandra Khan. At present, many Vaisnavas
are coming to our Krsna consciousness movement from among the Europeans and
Americans, and although a man like Ramacandra Khan is always envious of such
Vaisnavas, one should follow in the footsteps of Sri Advaita Acarya by treating all
of them as Vaisnavas. Although they are not as exalted as Haridasa Thakura, such
Americans and Europeans, having accepted the principles of Vaisnava philosophy
and behavior, should never be excluded from Vaisnava society.

Text 222] The Glories of Haridasa Thakura 321
PURPORT
Srila Advaita Acarya was not afraid of the strict brahminical culture and customs
of society. As stated in the $astric injunctions, which are the true medium of evi-
dence or proof, anyone can go back to Godhead, even if born of a low family.
Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita:
marn hi partha vyapasritya
ye ‘pi syuh papa-yonayah
striyo vaisyas tatha sadras
te ‘pi yanti param gatim
“O son of Prtha, those who take shelter in Me, though they be of lower birth —
women, vaisyas [merchants], as well as sadras [workers] —can approach the
supreme destination.” (Bg. 9.32) Though having taken a low birth in human
society, one who accepts Krsna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead is quite
competent to go back home, back to Godhead; and one who is a bona fide can-
didate for going back to Godhead should not be considered lowborn, or candala.
That is also a $astric injunction. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (2.4.18):
kirata-hanandhra-pulinda-pulkasa
abhira-sumbha yavanah khasadayah
ye ‘nye ca papa yad-apasrayasrayah
Sudhyanti tasmai prabhavisnave namah
Not only the yavanas and khasadayah but even those born in still lower families
can be purified (Sudhyanti) by the grace of a devotee of Lord Krsna, for Krsna em-
powers such devotees to perform this purification. Advaita Acarya had confi-
dence in the $astric evidence and did not care about social customs. The Krsna
consciousness movement, therefore, is a cultural movement that does not care
about local social conventions. Following in the footsteps of Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu and Advaita Acarya, we can accept a devotee from any part of the
world and recognize him as a brahmana as soon as he is qualified due to following
the principles of Vaisnava behavior.

--- Page 324 ---
322 Sri Caitanya-caritamrta [Antya-lila, Ch. 3
SYNONYMS
tumi khaile—if you eat; haya—there is; koti-brahmana-bhojana—feeding ten
million brahmanas; eta bali—saying this; sraddha-patra—the dish offered to the
forefathers; karaila bhojana—made to eat.
TRANSLATION
“Feeding you is equal to feeding ten million brahmanas,” Advaita Acarya
said. “Therefore, accept this sraddha-patra./’’ Thus Advaita Acarya made him
eat.
PURPORT
Sraddha is prasada offered to the forefathers at a certain date of the year or
month. The sraddha-patra, or plate offered to the forefathers, is then offered to
the best of the brahmanas in society. Instead of offering the sraddha-patra to any
other brahmana, Advaita Acarya offered it to Haridasa Thakura, considering him
greater than any of the foremost brahmanas. This act by भा Advaita Acarya proves
that Haridasa Thakura was always situated in a transcendental position and was
therefore always greater than even the most exalted brahmana, for he was situ-
ated above the mode of goodness of the material world. Referring to the Bhakti-
sandarbha, verse 177, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura quotes the following
statements from the Garuda Purana in this connection:
brahmananarin sahasrebhyah
satra-yaji visisyate
satra-yaji-sahasrebhyah
sarva-vedanta-paragah
sarva-vedanta-vit-kotya
visnu-bhakto visisyate
vaisnavanam sahasrebhya
ekanty eko visisyate
“A brahmana qualified to offer sacrifices is better than an ordinary brahmana, and
better than such a brdhmana is one who has studied all the Vedic scriptures.
Among many such brahmanas, one who is a devotee of Lord Visnu is the best;
and among many such Vaisnavas, one who fully engages in the service of the Lord
is the best!”

Text 223] The Glories of Haridasa Thakura 323
“There are many different kinds of devotees, but even a Vaisnava coming from a
family of mlecchas or yavanas is understood to be a learned scholar, complete in
knowledge, if he knows the Vaisnava philosophy. He should therefore be given
charity, for such a Vaisnava is as worshipable as the Supreme Personality of God-
head.”
na me ’bhaktas catur-vedi

Lord Krsna says, “Even if a nondevotee comes from a brahmana family and is ex-
pert in studying the Vedas, he is not very dear to Me, whereas even if a sincere
devotee comes from a low family of meat-eaters, he is very dear to Me. Such a
sincere pure devotee should be given charity, for he is as worshipable as 1.”

TRANSLATION
Advaita Acirya was always absorbed in thoughts of how to deliver the fallen
souls of the entire world. “The entire world is full of nondevotees,”” He
thought. “How will they be delivered?”
PURPORT
Srila Advaita Acarya sets the standard for dcaryas in the Vaisnava sampradaya.
An acarya must always be eager to deliver the fallen souls. A person who
establishes a temple or matha to take advantage of people’s sentiments by using
for his livelihood what people contribute for the worship of the Deity cannot be
called a gosvami or acarya. One who knows the conclusion of the $astras, follows
in the footsteps of his predecessors and endeavors to preach the bhakti cult all
over the world is to be considered an acarya. The role of an acarya is not to earn
his livelihood through the income of the temple. न> Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati


--- Page 326 ---
324 $ri Caitanya-caritamrta [Antya-lila, Ch. 3
Thakura used to say that if one earns his livelihood by displaying the Deity in the
temple, he is not an acarya or gosvami. It would be better for him to accept ser-
vice even as a sweeper in the street, for that is a more honorable means of earning
one’s living.

PURPORT
In Bhagavad-gita (7.14) Lord Krsna says:
daivi hy esa gunamayi
mama maya duratyaya
mam eva ye prapadyante
mayam etarn taranti te
“This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is
difficult to overcome. But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross
beyond it!” This was actually proved by the behavior of Haridasa Thakura. Maya
enchants the entire world. Indeed, people have forgotten the ultimate goal of life
because of the dazzling attractions of the material world. But this dazzling attrac-
tion, especially the attractive beauty of a woman, is meant for persons who are
not surrendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord says, mam eva
ye prapadyante mayam etari taranti te: “One who is surrendered unto Me cannot
be conquered by the illusory energy.” The illusory energy personally came to test
Haridasa Thakura, but herein she admits her defeat, for she was unable to capti-
vate him. How is this possible? It was because Haridasa Thakura, fully surrendered
to the lotus feet of Krsna, was always absorbed in thoughts of Krsna by chanting
the holy names of the Lord 300,000 times daily as a vow.

brahma-adi jiva—all living entities, beginning from Lord Brahma; ami—I; sabare
mohilun—captivated everyone; ekela—alone; tomdre—you; ami—l\; mobhite
narilun—could not attract.

TRANSLATION

“1 have previously captivated the mind of even Brahma, not to speak of

others. Your mind alone have | failed to attract.
PURPORT

Beginning from Lord Brahma down to the insignificant ant, everyone, without
exception, is attracted by the illusory energy of the Supreme Personality of God-
head. The demigods, human beings, animals, birds, beasts, trees and plants are all
attracted by sexual desire. That is the illusion of maya. Everyone, whether man or
woman, thinks that he is the enjoyer of the illusory energy. In this way, everyone is
captivated and engaged in material activities. However, because Haridasa Thakura
was always thinking of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and was always busy
satisfying the senses of the Lord, this process alone saved him from the captiva-
tion of maya. This is practical proof of the strength of devotional service. Because
of his full engagement in the service of the Lord, he could not be induced to enjoy
maya. The verdict of the sastras is that a pure Vaisnava, or devotee of the Lord,
never thinks of enjoying the material world, which culminates in sex life. He never
thinks himself an enjoyer; instead, he always wants to be enjoyed by the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Therefore the conclusion is that the Supreme Personality
of Godhead is eternal, transcendental, beyond the perception of sense gratifica-
tion and beyond the material qualities. Only if a living entity gives up the false
conception that the body is the self and always thinks himself an eternal servant
of Krsna and the Vaisnavas can he surpass the influence of maya (mam eva ye pra-
padyante mayam etarh taranti te). A pure living entity who thus attains the stage
of anartha-nivrtti, cessation of everything unwanted, has nothing to enjoy in the
material world. One attains this stage only by properly performing the functions
of devotional service. Srila Rapa Gosvami has written:

Texts 252-253] The Glories of Haridasa Thakura 337
adau sraddha tatah sadhu-sango ‘tha bhajana-kriya
tato ‘nartha-nivrttih syat tato nistha rucis tatah
“In the beginning one must have a preliminary desire for self-realization. This will
bring one to the stage of trying to associate with persons who are spiritually ele-
vated. In the next stage, one becomes initiated by an elevated spiritual master,
and under his instruction the neophyte devotee begins the process of devotional
service. By execution of devotional service under the guidance of the spiritual
master, one becomes freed from all material attachments, attains steadiness in
self-realization and acquires a taste for hearing about the Absolute Personality of
Codhead, 5 Krsna.” (B.r.s. 1.4.15) If one is actually executing devotional service,
then anarthas, the unwanted things associated with material enjoyment, will auto-
matically disappear.

--- Page 342 ---
340 $ri Caitanya-caritamrta [Antya-lila, Ch. 3
PURPORT
In an indirect way, this verse explains the chanting of the Hare Krsna maha-
mantra. The Hare Krsna maha-mantra—Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare
Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare—includes both the holy
name of Lord Krsna and the name of Lord Rama. Lord Rama gives one the oppor-
tunity to be liberated, but simply by liberation one does not get actual spiritual
benefit. Sometimes if one is liberated from the material world but has no shelter at
the lotus feet of Krsna, one falls down to the material world again. Liberation is like
a state of convalescence, in which one is free from a fever but is still not healthy.
Even in the stage of convalescence, if one is not very careful, one may have a
relapse. Similarly, liberation does not offer as much security as the shelter of the
lotus feet of Krsna. It is stated in the sastra:
ye ‘nye ’ravindaksa vimukta-maninas
tvayy asta-bhavad avisuddha-buddhayah
aruhya krcchrepa parari pada tatah

patanty adho ‘nadrta-yusmad-arighrayah
“O Lord, the intelligence of those who think themselves liberated but who have
no devotion is impure. Even though they rise to the highest point of liberation by
dint of severe penances and austerities, they are sure to fall down again into ma-
terial existence, for they do not take shelter at Your lotus feet.” (Srimad-
Bhagavatam 10.2.32) Yusmad-anghrayah refers to the lotus feet of Krsna. If one
does not take shelter of Krsna’s lotus feet, he falls down (patanty adhah), even
from liberation. The Hare Krsna maha-mantra, however, gives liberation and at the
same time offers shelter at the lotus feet of Krsna. If one takes shelter at the lotus
feet of Krsna after liberation, he develops his dormant ecstatic love for Krsna. That
is the highest perfection of life.

Madhya-lila (the middle period), the
longest of the three, is a detailed narration of
Sri Caitanya’s extensive and eventful travels
throughout India as a renounced mendicant,
teacher, philosopher, spiritual preceptor and
mystic. Finally, Antya-lila (the final period)
concerns the last eighteen years of Caitanya
Mahaprabhu’s manifest presence, spent in
semiseclusion in Jagannatha Puri, Orissa.
During these final years, ऊन Caitanya drifted
deeper and deeper into trances of spiritual
ecstasy unparalleled in all of religious and
literary history, Eastern or Western.

Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami, the author of
Sri Caitanya-caritamrta, was a great saint and
a confidential disciple and student of
Raghunatha dasa Gosvami, the renowned
ascetic saint who was one of the most inti-
mate disciples of Sri Caitanya. He com-
menced work on the text while in his late
nineties and in failing health, as he vividly
describes in the text itself: “I have now be-
come too old and disturbed in invalidity.
While writing, my hands tremble. | cannot
remember anything, nor can | see or hear
properly. Still | write, and this is a great
wonder.” That he nevertheless completed,
under such debilitating conditions, the
greatest literary gem of medieval India is
surely one of the wonders of literary history.

The English translation and commentary is

न the work of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhakti-
vedanta Swami Prabhupada, the world’s
most distinguished scholar and teacher of
Indian religious and philosophical thought.
He himself is a disciplic descendant of ऊत
Caitanya, and his intimate familiarity with
the precepts of Caitanya Mahaprabhu emi-
nently qualifies him to present this impor-
tant classic to the English-speaking world.
The ease and clarity with which he ex-
pounds upon Sri Caitanya’s precepts lures ए
even a reader totally unfamiliar with Indian
religious tradition into a genuine under-
standing and appreciation of this profound
and monumental work.

The entire text, with commentary, pre-
sented in seventeen lavishly illustrated
volumes by the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust,
represents a contribution of major impor-
tance to the intellectual, cultural and
spiritual life of contemporary man.
